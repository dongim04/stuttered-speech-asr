0,6925-80680-0006.flac,the king made king made king made no remark but sent for a palanquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a thou th a long way off into the forest and there leave her in spite of her tears she was forced to obey
1,6925-80680-0072.flac,amer ali bowed low and answered that he had undone and would do the king all the service that lay in his power save only this one thing thing the king who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man flew into a passion and the princess was more furious still
2,6925-80680-0040.flac,and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace when he had finished his story he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king who like everyone else was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it indeed
3,6925-80680-0036.flac,ameer ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager
4,6925-80680-0070.flac,then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry ameer ali
5,6925-80680-0032.flac,whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard
6,6925-80680-0039.flac,and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness ameer ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot
7,6925-80680-0020.flac,the old woman's face brightened she showed him the im where to seek the water and when he returned a few minutes a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim she led the way without a word and he followed in a short while th elthe el tel they came to a hut in the forest
8,6925-80680-0069.flac,how do you think our princess is looking now very fine no doubt grumbled the parrot but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only she oneself only she oneself only she ought to have a husband why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things
9,6925-80680-0003.flac,we'll call the guard and ask and if it was a jackal i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away and if it was a tiger then you shall go and i will marry a new wife as you like answered the queen there isn't any doubt which it was
10,6925-80680-0007.flac,and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood
11,6925-80680-0037.flac,and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back which which she did very nimbly then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck
12,6925-80680-0081.flac,then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up ameer ameer ameer ali and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside at the sight of tight of the night of her the king was filled with shame and self reproach and wished he could have lived his life over again
13,6925-80680-0062.flac,and again ameer ali spent nearly the ealy the ealy the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me
14,6925-80680-0018.flac,presently as he made his way through a thicket he saw a prespigeon which he thought would make a good dinner so he fired a pellet at it from his galail but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter at the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket
15,6925-80680-0021.flac,and as they drew near it ameer ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on and on at the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut and much as he wished to see her again
16,6925-80680-0065.flac,from her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron ad and bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds
17,6925-80680-0008.flac,and started home again now the queen thought to herself e elt that the king could not mean to send her away for good and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back and her back and her back so she stayed quite still for a long time listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps
18,6925-80680-0082.flac,and not and not andnot have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death my days aayus passed said he and he gave up his crown to his son ameer ali ho ani h ani who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne
19,6925-80680-0029.flac,but each one showed the same strange fear then ameer ali stepped he stepped he stepped forward this is my duty your majesty he said i will go the king nodded and off he went the night was as dark as pitch
20,6925-80680-0022.flac,ameer ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back and so with am awu with a heavy heart he made his  salutation and bade the old woman farewell but when he had gone a little way she called after hma am after am after him if ever you are in trouble or danger
21,6925-80680-0009.flac,but heard none after a while she grew nervous for she was all alone and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir
22,6925-80680-0019.flac,and on reaching the spot he found an uand uan ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head
23,6925-80680-0085.flac,she smiles at him and says is it the tiger then or the jackal
24,6925-80680-0034.flac,but a horrid but horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth if ever a man strayed into witchland the ogresses used to eat him up and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper
25,6925-80680-0038.flac,but ameer ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck
26,6925-80680-0050.flac,then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten had never forgotten what is the matter she asked in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb
27,6925-80680-0033.flac,or of the roaring river as for ghosts and witches they had never troubled o shes they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman what ails you he he he said now the woman was not really a woman at all
28,6925-80680-0026.flac,and promised that he should enter his body guard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous this is just what ameer ali wanted and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish
29,6925-80680-0075.flac,who thought that they had as good a chance as any one else to gain both the throne and the princess as soon as the king was seated he called upon an usher o upon an usher to upon an usher to summon the first claimant but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer
30,6925-80680-0079.flac,to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger tiger the king turned first re dre to red and then pale there is continued the farmer continued the farmer continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne where
31,6925-80680-0049.flac,therefore away he went and after a after a day's travelling he reached the cottage in the forest and standing where he had stood when the old old old old woman called to him he cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me help me
32,6925-80680-0066.flac,then the head and hands were joined on to the body and left neither sign nor nor scar full of gratitude ameer ali tried to speak to her but she ran into the house and would not come back and he was forced to leave her
33,6925-80680-0028.flac,begged that he might not be sent on such an errand particularly on a night so wild when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad indeed so frightened was he that the king who was very kind hearted bade another to go in his stead
34,6925-80680-0078.flac,no your majesty answered the farmer i would only remind your ni would only remind your i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered to day to try and claim your daughter and kingdom every city has sent them and they wait hungry and eager but do not o king mistake or pretend again
35,6925-80680-0067.flac,when on the day appointed ameer ali produced produced a necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless than the last the king's astonishment knew no bounds and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy
36,6925-80680-0005.flac,mind you declare that the king is right it certainly was a certainly was a jackal but if we say so the king will probably not keep his word about going away and we shall get into trouble so we had better take his side to this the other agreed
37,6925-80680-0043.flac,walking grandly about with grandly about with her treasure tied round her ankle she heard the starling say to the parrot
38,6925-80680-0030.flac,but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water inch by inch and foot by foot he fought his way across now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy now narrowly escaping
39,6925-80680-0071.flac,so the king sent for ameer ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honour of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to e se  er to the throne on hearing this speech
40,6925-80680-0056.flac,then the maiden opened her eyes sprang to her her feet and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut and would not come out or speak to him any more
41,6925-80680-0041.flac,ameer ali himself was astonished for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since the king was delighted at its beauty and having praised and rewarded ameer ali he gave the anklet to his daughter a proud and spoiled princess
42,6925-80680-0059.flac,and never recovered his temper until after lunch she's got all all her beauty at one end of her now if she had a few of those fine gewgaus round her neck and wrists she would look better but now to my mind
43,6925-80680-0055.flac,and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems his heart took courage very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron and he quickly changed the wands placed the severet foot against the wound and immediately the two parts became one as before
44,6925-80680-0058.flac,and strutted up and down in them admiring herself in the mirrors that lined the room
45,6925-80680-0084.flac,she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother and when godmother and when godmother and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she gladly returned to fairyland the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife any more if he even looks as if he does not agree with her
46,6925-80680-0017.flac,many a weary mile he treap treptrep tramped day after day until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred and he stepped joyfully into it like one who goes to meet an old friend
47,6925-80680-0063.flac,once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted
48,6925-80680-0047.flac,or he should be hanged or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment poor ameer ali or ameer ali was greatly troubled at the king's command but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans he left the palace at once
49,6925-80680-0073.flac,ameer ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find avad amvand and ordered to be kept there amiathere there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death mean to death meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay
50,6925-80680-0031.flac,being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream at length he emerged panting and dripping wet on the other side close by the bank stood a gallows and on the gallows hung the body of some evil doer
51,6925-80680-0083.flac,there is only one purse and i will marry said he and this time the maiden did not run away but agreed to be his wife wife so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily as for the old woman whose pitcher ameer ali had broken
52,6925-80680-0011.flac,where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbors as it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house but was awakened by the sound of weeping he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could and into the forest towards the place the sound came from
53,6925-80680-0035.flac,in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue so when when when ameer ali questioned her she replied ah kind sir it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows help me to get him down and i will bless you forever
54,6925-80680-0016.flac,a big brass pot to hold water a few pieces of silver
55,6925-80680-0053.flac,and i shall become quite well again as before at first
56,6925-80680-0064.flac,and her head her words turned ameer al and al alib pale with horror but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before and at last he consented to do as she bade him
57,6925-80680-0052.flac,and hold it over the cauldron and every drop of blood that falls frand and from it into the water will become a jewel next you must change the wands so that the one ananit stood at my head is at my feet and the one at my feet stands at my head and place the severed foot against the wound and it will heal
58,6925-80680-0080.flac,growing pale as he listened in prison replied the farmer if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals i will explain clear the court commanded the king and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace now
59,6925-80680-0004.flac,so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question questiond questioned to them but whilst the dispute was the dispute was going on the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other
60,6925-80680-0042.flac,now in the women's apartments in the palace there hung two cages in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling and these two birds could talk as well as human beings they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was
61,6925-80680-0044.flac,that was the parrot's name how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel think snapped the parrot who was cross because they hadn't given him his bath that morning i think she looks like a washerwoman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off
62,6925-80680-0027.flac,soon after this this on a dark and stormy night when the river roared beneath the palace walls the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter but the servant falling on his knees in terror
63,6925-80680-0077.flac,whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up
64,6925-80680-0015.flac,at last when he was i at  eighteen years of age they had not the heart to forbid him any longer
65,6925-80680-0074.flac,so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighboring countries proclaiming proclaiming proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and ssa heir to the throne should present himself at the palace when the day came all the court where the court where  the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men young and old
66,6925-80680-0024.flac,shortly afterwards he arrived at a city and as he was now in great straits
67,6925-80680-0002.flac,if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen i say it was a tiger cried the king don't contradict me nonsense snapped the queen it was a jackal and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at last very well
68,6925-80680-0061.flac,and then she declared to her father to her father to her father that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die again the king sent for ameer ali and ordered him to get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month or be put to a cruel death
69,6925-80680-0012.flac,and when she had told her story the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on and in the farm a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named ameer ali
70,6925-80680-0023.flac,come to where you now stand and cry fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me now and i will listen to you the prince thanked her and continued his journey but he thought little of the old woman's saying and much of the lovely damsel
71,6925-80680-0000.flac,one hot night in hindustan a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice and they hoped they were going to sleep but they never did presently they became more broad awake than ever
72,6925-80680-0010.flac,but although the queen's bbuttween's queen's eyes wandered in all directions there was no sign of any human being then her spirit gave way and she began to cry it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest
73,6925-80680-0025.flac,the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more
74,6925-80680-0014.flac,very few ever came near vear ver venier them and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make make vermake his own living but she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait until
75,6925-80680-0060.flac,she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up she up poor princess she poor princess poor princess she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill
76,6925-80680-0048.flac,and inquired of every one where the finest jewels and te finest jewels the finest jewels were to be got but though he sought night and day he never found one to compare with the anklet at last only a week remained and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the fairy of the forest
77,6925-80680-0068.flac,the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought the thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with ault with her appearance and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say
78,6925-80680-0076.flac,well hasten then said then said then said the king i have no time to waste your majesty said the farmer has now lived and administered justice long in this city
79,6925-80680-0045.flac,why doesn't she wear two of he two of them instead of going about with one leg adorned and the other what what othere empty when the princess heard this she burst into tears and sending for her father
80,6925-80680-0001.flac,at the sound of a howl outside the palace listen to that that tht that tiger remarked the king tiger replied the ad the queen how should there be a tiger inside the city it was only a jackal i tell you it was a tiger said the king and i tell you that you were dreaming
81,6925-80680-0054.flac,at length she persuaded him to do her bidding he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off she lay as one lifeless but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it
82,6925-80680-0057.flac,but three rare and beautiful anklets and these he butbut and these he and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts and the next day but day the vain princess put two anklets on each foot
83,6925-80680-0046.flac,or she would die of shame so the king sent for ameer ali
84,6925-80680-0013.flac,years passed without a sign from the king his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care though the queen still lived with the farmer and the the farmer and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong handsome and healthy youth out in the forest they seemed far from the world
85,6925-80680-0051.flac,then he told her his story and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart and then turning to him she said
86,6437-66173-0049.flac,he had as we suspected witnessd tat witnessed that witnessed the closing scene of the fight from the schoolroom window and the next morning after prayers i was not wholly unprepared when master conway and myself were called up to the desk for examination
87,6437-66173-0024.flac,you'll get no description of it from from from from me simply because i think it would prove very poor reading and not because i consider my revolt against conway's tyranny unjustifiable i i had borne conway's persecutions for many months with lamblike patience
88,6437-66173-0051.flac,that conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the temple school their evidence also went to show that conway was a quarrelsome character generally bad for conway seth rodgers on the part of his friend
89,6437-66173-0002.flac,and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his  an accomplishment peculiarly his and an accomplishment peculiarly his own that of throwing his thumbs out of joint at will and will sometimes while absorbed in study or on becoming nervous at recitation
90,6437-66173-0046.flac,i believe it runs in the family i think said miss abigail without the faintest expression on her countenance that a tablespoonful of f of hot drop the captain interrupted miss abigail peremptorily
91,6437-66173-0010.flac,and keeping my eye fixed steadily on conway's in all of which i was faithfully following the instruct and struck constructions of phil adams whose father subscribed to a sporting journal conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude
92,6437-66173-0062.flac,he and his shadow seth rogers gave me a wide wide wide berth for many months nor watwas binny wallace subjected to further molestation miss abigail's sanitary stores ition miss abigail's sanitary stores including a bottle of opadeldoc were never called into requisition
93,6437-66173-0048.flac,they'll be handy to have in the house says miss s s abigail grimly of course so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by mister grimshaw
94,6437-66173-0057.flac,if there's any fighting to be done i am the person to beconsulted i disapprove of boys fighting it is unnecessary and unchristian in the present instance i consider every large boy in this school at fault
95,6437-66173-0008.flac,he reached forward one of his long arms he had arms like a windmill that boy and grasping me by the the hair tore out quite a respectable handful the tears flew to my eyes
96,6437-66173-0001.flac,his red hair seemed to change to a livelier red and his sallow cheeks to a deeper sallow as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our slates the next day in school he knew we were watching him and made sundry mouths
97,6437-66173-0060.flac,we clasped hands we clasped hands we clasped hands in the tamest manner imaginable and conway mumbled i'm sorry iv fought with you fought with you i think you are i replied drily and i'm sorry i had to thrash you
98,6437-66173-0017.flac,but i was going to because he knows who put meeks's mortar over our door and and and i know well enough who did it it was that sneaking little malatter pointing at me oh by george i cried reddening at the insult
99,6437-66173-0000.flac,chapter ten i i i fight conway there was one person however who cherished a strong suspicion that the centipedes had had a hand in the business and that person was conway
100,6437-66173-0011.flac,and there we were glaring at each other motionless neither of us disposed to risk an atteetattack but both on the alert to resist one there's no telling how long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been interrupted
101,6437-66173-0036.flac,escorted by two or three of the schoolfellows i walked home home home through the pleasant autumn twilight ela ele elight battered but triumphant as i went along my cap cock on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye
102,6437-66173-0007.flac,but on seeing me sweep across the yard whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling he like a sling he called out lustily lay low conway here's young bailey conway who's young bailey conway wh's young bailey conway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended for his head
103,6437-66173-0056.flac,i disapprove of tale bearing i never encourage it or encourage it or encourage it in the slightest dedegree but when one pupil systematically persecutes a schoolmate it is the duty of some head boy to inform me no pupil has a right to take the law into his own hands
104,6437-66173-0015.flac,and put back my hair put back my hair this last condition was rather a staggerer i shan't do nothing of the sort said conway sulkily then the thing must go on said adams with dignity
105,6437-66173-0005.flac,were detained in school for the purpose of refreshing our memories with a page of mister andrew's perplexing irregular verbs binny wallace finishing his task first was dismissed i followed shortly after
106,6437-66173-0013.flac,the boys fell back perfor on the school yard just at this crisis a dozen or so of the templars entered the gate and seeing at a glance the belligerent step status of conway and myself dropped bat and ball and rushed to the spot where we stood
107,6437-66173-0027.flac,i am glad that i faced conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever i am glad that phil adam adams taught me to box and i say to all youngsters learn to box to ride to pull an oar and to swim
108,6437-66173-0032.flac,fight it out and don't give in while while you can stand and see and don't give in when you can't see for i could stand very little and see not at all having pommelled the school pump for the last twenty seconds
109,6437-66173-0029.flac,ever written for boys written for boys are these words learn to box then as you learn to play cricket and cricket and football not one of you will be the worse but very but very much the better for learning to box well
110,6437-66173-0061.flac,you can go to your seats said mister grimshaw turning his face aside to hide a smile i am a smile i am a smile i am sure my apology was a very good one i never had any more trouble with conway
111,6437-66173-0025.flac,i might have shielded myself by appealing to mister grimshaw but no boy in the temple grammar school could do that without losing cast whether this was just or not doesn't matter a pin since it was so a traditionary law of the place
112,6437-66173-0022.flac,and you'll have the sun in his eyes behold us once more face to face like once more face to face like david and the philistine look at us as long as you may for this is all you shall see of the combat
113,6437-66173-0034.flac,convinced of my errror i accepted his congratulations with those of the other boys blandly the other boys blandly the other boys blandly and blindly i remember that binny wallace wanted to give me his silver pencil case

351,6000-55211-0012.flac,billy really i think we should turn back but billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes she was missus greggory yes she was even as she uttered the words
352,6000-55211-0044.flac,billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass
353,6000-55211-0050.flac,perhaps they thnk think think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darred and chairs that are broken that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes alice gasped missus greggory in dismayed horror
354,6000-55211-0054.flac,and then won't y and then won't yo and then won't you keep it for me here i haven't the hundred dollars with me but i'll send it right away you will let me do it won't you it was an impulse impulse impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness
355,6000-55211-0053.flac,or what to say away but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something during the brief minute that he hesitated however billy sprang forward missus greggory please won't you let me buy the teapot
356,6000-55211-0042.flac,but alice my dear alice my dear she almost sobbed you didn't wait to let me tell you
357,6000-55211-0029.flac,but with only one foot to make it go you see the other is
358,6000-55211-0033.flac,i paid a hundred dollars for that i shall be glad to gi to give you the same for this madam missus greggory started visibly a hundred dollars so much as that she cried almost joyously
359,6000-55211-0049.flac,i can't help it stormed the girl hotly i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it
360,6000-55211-0061.flac,still i was sorry for the poor little old lady i wish somehow she could have ad that hundred dollars it was the man who said this not the collector so do i rejoined billy dolefully
361,6000-55211-0032.flac,the collector's eyes glowed he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it then he turned to the tray after a moment he spoke i have only one other in my collection as rare he said
362,6000-55211-0051.flac,with a little outward fling of her two hands alice greggory alice greggoryalice greggory stepped back her face had grown white again i i i beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet i should not have spoken so
363,6000-55211-0022.flac,near it set a tray like plate of the same ware and decoration if you'll lift it down please yourself motioned missus greggory i don't like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side
364,6000-55211-0017.flac,we er i came from harlowe missus greggory he gave me to understand you had an a teapot that er with his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table william henshaw came to a helpless pause
365,6000-55211-0027.flac,madam if you you do not wish to sell he stopped abruptly his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china missus greggory gave a low cry but i do that is i must
366,6000-55211-0005.flac,that she was one day o o be mistress of the strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her her i'd love to see it and i'll come gladly but i'm afraid i won't be much help uncle cl  icle william she worried i'll take the risk of that
367,6000-55211-0045.flac,billy was wondering which she herself desired which she herself desired which she herself desired more that uncle william should buy the lowestoft or that he should not she knew she wished missus greggory to have the hundred dollars there was no doubt on that point then uncle william spoke
368,6000-55211-0001.flac,billy r are you very busy this morning no indeed not if you want me well i do my dear uncle william's voice was troubled i want you to go with me if you can to see a missus greggory she's got a teapot i want
369,6000-55211-0058.flac,come billy we'll bid you good morning ladies said william henshaw then decisively and billy with a little wistful pat on missus greggory's clasped hands went once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk
370,6000-55211-0006.flac,why how funny well i'll com i'll come i'll come at eleven you say at park street yes and and thank you my dear i tried to get kate to go too but she wouldn't by the way i'm going to bringn you home to luncheon kate leaves this afternoon you know
371,6000-55211-0043.flac,he will he will give us a hundred dollars a hundred dollars echoed the girl faintly
372,6000-55211-0019.flac,though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke the lowest aft yes i'm so glad that is of course i must be glad i'll get it her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair
373,6000-55211-0025.flac,you'll find them quite perfect what perfect i think perfect i should say they were cried the meman they are then valuable missus greggory's voice shook indeed they are but you must know that
374,6000-55211-0018.flac,a curious expression this expression or rather series of expressions crossed missus greggory's greggory's greggory's face terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy relief in the end conquered
375,6000-55211-0007.flac,and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought best to try to get over to the house maybe aunt hannah would come too for luncheon would she i'm afraid not returned billy with a rueful laugh she's got three shawls on this morning
376,6000-55211-0039.flac,neilson supplied the man as she okdthe man as she looked at billy and hesitated a swift red stained stained stained alice greggory's face with barely barely barely in acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother yes dear but that won't be necessary now
377,6000-55211-0002.flac,it's a genuine lowestoft harlow says will you go of you go of course i will what time eleven if you can at park street she's at the west end
378,6000-55211-0059.flac,william henshaw drew along penshaw drew along penshaw drew a long breath well by jove billy the next time i take you curio hunting it won't be to this place he fumed wasn't it awful choked billy awful
379,6000-55211-0016.flac,missus greggory had seated herself now and william henshaw had cleared his throat nervously
380,6000-55211-0023.flac,with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation collector reached for the teapot his eyes sparkled billy look what a beauty and it's a lowest off too the real thing the genuine true soft paste
381,6000-55211-0060.flac,the girl was the most most most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss i ever saw i didn't want her old lowistoft if she didn't want to sell it but to practically invite me there and then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger
382,6000-55211-0011.flac,she finished just above her breath missus greggory was toary was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four four she four flights of stairs up which william henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing
383,6000-55211-0040.flac,as i started to tell you when i came in i have two new pupils and so turning to the man again i thank you for your  thank you for you thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present
384,6000-55211-0055.flac,but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy missus greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking dear child she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own
385,6000-55211-0026.flac,i have been told so yet o me their chief value of course lies in their association my mother and my association my mother and my association my mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir again her voice broke william henshaw cleared his throke but
386,6000-55211-0048.flac,do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing alice
387,6000-55211-0015.flac,mechanic uly she had taken the chair toward which missus greggory had motioned her she had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain
388,6000-55211-0052.flac,you are very kind mister henshaw but i do not think we care to sell the lowestoft to day both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh william henshaw picked up his hat his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do
389,6000-55211-0028.flac,and that it will bring in money and we need money she threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks i can't do much at work that pays i sew she nodded toward the machine by the window
390,6000-55211-0014.flac,both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay
391,6000-55211-0010.flac,nonsense uncle william of course you won't turn back
392,8975-270782-0096.flac,infantile side of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions partly because it is lightly considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child
393,8975-270782-0103.flac,which however disclose only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dream work is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression
394,8975-270782-0082.flac,under the pressure of education he lays n he lays he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes rather their accredits to both the same genital formation
395,8975-270782-0102.flac,and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts
396,8975-270782-0093.flac,and most customary choice and that not until later is there any resistance the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology
397,8975-270782-0091.flac,the most monstrous efforts have been made to explain h efforts have been made to explain efforts have been made to explain this fear of incest some have believed that it is due to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature which is psychically represented by this prohibition because in breeding would deteriorate the race character
398,8975-270782-0086.flac,and then at the writing table defend the sexual purity of the same children where children are left to themselves or are under the influence of corruption
399,8975-270782-0094.flac,toward the understanding twistanding orstanding of the dream we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream
400,8975-270782-0087.flac,of perverse sexual activity to be suure the grown ups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances as play for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of custom or before the law
401,8975-270782-0083.flac,toward those persons closest to him and who are dear to him for various reasons his parents brothers and sisters nurses and finally you may observe in him that which later breaks through again raise now to a love attraction
402,8975-270782-0113.flac,what is the use of giving new life to old long outgrown psychic stimuli wishes and charcchracter types that is why i i iy the material regression in addition to the formal the only satisfactory answer would be this
403,8975-270782-0077.flac,thus we are moved to study the development of sex life in the child also and we discover the following from a number of sources in the first place it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual life and to take it for granted
404,8975-270782-0108.flac,the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication
405,8975-270782-0111.flac,which shall differentiate it from the it from the it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we may to be sure propound the question what forces the psychologic does the psychological activity during sleep to such regression
406,8975-270782-0107.flac,how does one solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that shares its characteristics
407,8975-270782-0088.flac,but these things do exist they have their significance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and furtherances of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man
408,8975-270782-0100.flac,are ashameshamed and angry if one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form
409,8975-270782-0085.flac,and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business full business these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexualalalual faults of the child
410,8975-270782-0104.flac,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even or old into biald intelold intellectual property
411,8975-270782-0076.flac,by applying our former researches to the study of the psychi life of the child we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden dream wishes of excessive sexual impulses may be explained in the same manner
412,8975-270782-0105.flac,unconscious is no longer a name for what ii at that time latent the unconscious is an especial especial especial psychic realm with wish impulses of its own with its own method of expression tion tion and with a psychic mechanism peculiar to itself
413,8975-270782-0112.flac,why do not the sleep disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it and if they must because of e and if they must because of and if they must because of the dream censorship disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible
414,8975-270782-0109.flac,between these two parts the dream work completes itself the the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious nesscitates regression this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream
415,8975-270782-0092.flac,others maintain that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the persons under consideration in both cases furthermore the incestof cestav cest avoidance would be automatically assured
416,8975-270782-0090.flac,those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what antipathy society feels towards such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it
417,8975-270782-0081.flac,he knows  no unbridgeable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he is not disgusted at the sight of excrement but slowly learns to be so disgusted
418,8975-270782-0079.flac,what we call perverse in the life of an adult differ differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the gulf between man and animal second
419,8975-270782-0084.flac,polymorfparfis perverse and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses of all these impulses it is on the one hand because of their lesser intensity as compare to later life and on the other hand
420,8975-270782-0097.flac,since the dream regresses to this state an regresses to this state an regresses to this stage it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us but it is only a deceptie s only a deceptive is only a deceptive appearance by which by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams
421,8975-270782-0095.flac,with all its peculiarities its egoism its incestuous love choice et cetera continues for the purposes of the dream in the unconscious
422,8975-270782-0089.flac,when we rediscover over gover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field
423,8975-270782-0078.flac,that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects
424,8975-270782-0101.flac,as we would be if we understood it if we understood it if we understood it just think of the scandalized opinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of services of love the problem is not yet solved
425,8975-270782-0110.flac,that we are able to attain without having searched through further psychic realms the time will soon come however when we shall clothe the unconscious character of the latent dream thought with another name
426,8975-270782-0106.flac,but the latent dream thoughts which we have solved but by means of the dream interpretation are not of this realm they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours still they are unconscious
427,8975-270782-0099.flac,but being reasonable is reasonable is reasonable is only a part of psychic life many things are taking place there that are nnot reasonable and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams and unreasonably we turn them over to the dream censorship
428,8975-270782-0080.flac,being insensible to the convention be ventional feeling of disgust third the incest limitation being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction with near blood relations fourth homosexuality and fifth
429,8975-270782-0114.flac,that only in this manner can a dream be built up
430,8975-270782-0098.flac,if the evil impulses of the dream are merely enfantilism a return to the beginnings of our ethical development since the dream simply makes children of us again in thinking and in feeling we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable
431,8975-270782-0075.flac,who were so fortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents and intimately associated therewith we find what we call the cestratian complex the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father
432,8975-270782-0054.flac,and disclose a tendency to separate those of the same sex daughter from mother father from son the daughter finds in her mother the authority that hems in her will and that is entrusted with the tap and that is entrusted with the task of causing her to carry out
433,8975-270782-0018.flac,his head deeply sunk into his neck i concluded from the content that he was a physician luckily i was able to ask my mother who was still living how the physician in my birthplace which i left when i was three years old looked
434,8975-270782-0052.flac,which in the other case we permitted to remain profane
435,8975-270782-0026.flac,she beat her body with her fists in a fit of anger in order to kill hill the child how many mothers who to day love their children tenderly perhaps too tenderly received them unwillingly and at the time wished that the life within them would not develop further
436,8975-270782-0025.flac,which early ended in a separation
437,8975-270782-0046.flac,interesting object as a sort of living doll and if the difference is eight years or more motherly impulses especially in the case of girls may come into play but to be truthful when we disclose in a dream the wish for the death of a mother or sister
438,8975-270782-0069.flac,but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child and one tends rather to underestimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments which may follow from it in addition
439,8975-270782-0050.flac,and rivalry among them but how many feelings of hatred forced their way into the relationship the relationship between daughter and mother parents and child eld held children this relationship is without doubt the more favorable even when looked at from the viewpoint of the child
440,8975-270782-0070.flac,children frequently react to the oedipus idea through stimulation by the parents who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences so that the father prefers the daughter the mother the son
441,8975-270782-0016.flac,and have belonged to the unconscious but sometimes they bob up out of the unconscious spontaneously and as a matter of fact this is what happens in dreams it is apparent that the dream life knows how to hw to fined the entrance to these latent
442,8975-270782-0064.flac,h sax but we also find this dream in which in places where it has no connection with life and were the adult in his wak hours would never recognize it the reason for this is that the deepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly
443,8975-270782-0022.flac,in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asks the question whence such a wish comes
444,8975-270782-0056.flac,to the son the father is the embodiment of every social patment of every social patment of every social restriction born with such great opposition ition the father bars the way to freedom of will to early sexual satisfaction
445,8975-270782-0067.flac,ideas which we designate as the oedipus complex because this myth realizes with s with swith a very slightly weakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situationraation of the son to kill his father and take his mother to wife
446,8975-270782-0035.flac,which most frequently can be traced back to the unwich to the unto the unbounded egoism of the dreamer
447,8975-270782-0008.flac,and makes remarks which years later are retold to it told to it but which it has itself entirely forgotten bebebesides the memory in the early years is more facile because it is less burdened than in later years
448,8975-270782-0037.flac,we have wandered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human cy of human y of human nature and certainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result bult ult of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past
449,8975-270782-0017.flac,beautiful examples of this occur in literatre and i myself can present such an example i once dreamed in a certain connection of a petion of a pergon of a person who must have performed some service for me and whom i clearly saw he was a one eyed man short in stature stout
450,8975-270782-0019.flac,and i learned from her that he had one eye was short and stout with his stout with his head sunk into his neck and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me this control over the forgotten material of childhood years
451,8975-270782-0009.flac,nor is there any reason for considering the mememem emry function as a particularly high or difficult psychic performance in fact the contrary is true and you cayou can you can find a good memory in persons who stand very low intellectually
452,8975-270782-0060.flac,rather than that this task should be left to the senet nnic in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal
453,8975-270782-0051.flac,this is in accord with our expectation we find it much more offensive for love between parents and children to be lacking than for love between brothers and sisters we have so to speak made something holly in the first instance
454,8975-270782-0005.flac,in this connection it appears to me for example that the symbolic relations which the individual has never learned
455,8975-270782-0062.flac,as in the c   s of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example three it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses
456,8975-270782-0014.flac,by means of careful analysis one is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten
457,8975-270782-0063.flac,by which it is suppressed and must wait until a dream isolates it that which the dream shows us in enlarged form as a result of such isolation shrinks together again after it has been properly doceted in its relation to life as a result of our interpretation
458,8975-270782-0042.flac,often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling or rather let us say glossed over but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier it is most notable in children of from two and one half
459,8975-270782-0071.flac,and this love is substituted for the outworn love one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the oedipus complex on the contrary it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults
460,8975-270782-0072.flac,and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this and  in denying this proscribed or tabood feeling relationship later made good the omission made good the omission made good the omission by taking all value from the complex anaking all value from the complex through false interpretations according to my unchanged conviction
461,8975-270782-0029.flac,that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur
462,8975-270782-0041.flac,for his brothers thers for his and sisters with that which he has for his parents
463,8975-270782-0073.flac,cast out of life was yielded up to poetry and given the freest poetry and given the freest poetry and given the freest play o rank has shown in a careful study how this very oedipus complex has supplied dramatic literature
464,8975-270782-0027.flac,indeed translated this wish in islated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some death wish against some loved one which seems so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person
465,8975-270782-0021.flac,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he
466,8975-270782-0036.flac,as often as someone aoften as some nadoften as some one has been in our way in life and how often must this happen in the complicated relationships of life the dream is is isis ready to do away with him be he father mother brother sister spouse et cetera
467,8975-270782-0049.flac,if there is any one who hates a young english lady more than does her mother it is her elder sister there is something about this saying however that arouses our antipathy we can at a pinch understand hatred of brothers and sisters
468,8975-270782-0034.flac,that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past let us continue with the removal or death wish

689,8468-286673-0030.flac,this did not really give him pain yet as he said  afterward it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt as it does to be hurt as it does to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the  he slow little turtle go
690,8468-286673-0025.flac,and slid into the water all her friends and all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him dampd him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle
691,8468-286673-0010.flac,yet down in his his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side
692,8468-286673-0008.flac,the mother turtle raised one of her fore feet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said
693,8468-286673-0039.flac,he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot
694,8468-286673-0029.flac,he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell
695,8468-286673-0020.flac,and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond
696,8468-286673-0021.flac,their mother their mother their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their rounded up back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black
697,8468-286673-0031.flac,then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night
698,8468-286673-0026.flac,then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and help and help thand held him bottom side up per then per thipper thinpermost and rapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes
699,8468-286673-0006.flac,the sun as the sun has the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well bu mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neckskin she was so eager to see them all
700,8468-286673-0015.flac,and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not have him with us long
701,8468-286673-0033.flac,i'm here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you i'm not hungry he murmured
702,8468-286673-0023.flac,yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never ied never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all
703,8468-286673-0014.flac,i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sad very very sad
704,8468-286673-0037.flac,if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that
705,8468-286673-0022.flac,she could see their strong little strong little pointed tails too and their webbed feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them
706,8468-286673-0032.flac,i wish i might help you some time
707,8468-286673-0018.flac,or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises
708,8468-286673-0040.flac,and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle
709,831-130746-0049.flac,what we had best be doing you are tiredrrd you know and we can't wander all night after the day we've had that was chichester we were near she asked if he meditated with a tremble in his voice
710,831-130746-0038.flac,she who has spiritualized the world alone save for two attendant steady shining stares and in silence under her benighing influence under the benediction of her light rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night
711,831-130746-0008.flac,after a pause bechamel went back to the dining room they heard a chair creak under him interlude of conversational eyebrows i'm going up said stephen to break the melancholy news to him bechamel looked up from a weak old newspaper
712,831-130746-0058.flac,quite a misunderstanding said hoopdriver with splendid readiness dinadiness my sister had gone to bognore but i nor but i brought her back here ive took a fancy to this place place place and the moonlights simply divine we've had supper thanks and we're tired said mister hoopdriver
713,831-130746-0042.flac,you are safe said mister hoopdriver sweeping off  his cap with an air of bowing courtly bertly where are we safe but where chichester harbour he waved his arm seaward as though it was a goal do you think they will follow us
714,831-130746-0032.flac,at a footfall at a roughness in the road at at she seemed to be too intent upon escape to give much thought to him
715,831-130746-0043.flac,we have turned and turned again it seemed to hoopdriver that he heard her sob she stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath
716,831-130746-0027.flac,hoopdriver had hohooped cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born had bechamel arisen in the way with rapears hoopedhooped with rapears with rapears for a duel hoopdriver had fought as one to whom agencourt was a reality and drapery af dream
717,831-130746-0030.flac,then amidst vilas again vilas again some warm and lamplit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw broad wan meadows shrouded in a low lying mist
718,831-130746-0055.flac,almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbationioon in her our eyes it was as i have indicated the hour and season of the full moon
719,831-130746-0024.flac,the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthfulfulful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vicuna hotel we leave al bognor as we have left all chinchester
720,831-130746-0017.flac,stephen was too surprised to say anything but bourbon sir go on said bechamel damn you stephen's sympathies changed at once yes sir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marvelling
721,831-130746-0022.flac,i bechamel when with an awhen with an awhen with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door stephen entered with the bourbon
722,831-130746-0033.flac,his mind became an enormous appreciatihishsission of the position the night was a warm white silence saay for the subtle running of their chains
723,831-130746-0005.flac,incredulous eyes stared into one another into one another into one another's in the bar as his paces muffled by the stair carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead
724,831-130746-0056.flac,and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converged thereupon that chichester was at last attained it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the red but the red but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm
725,831-130746-0029.flac,he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears but what but what light is there lighting light is there lighting light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon the road turned north road turned northward going round through the outskirts of bognor
726,831-130746-0046.flac,promise to sto help and protect me i was unhappy at home never mind what bwhy a stepmother idle unoccupied hindered cramped that is enough perhap peraps then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire
727,831-130746-0026.flac,how their hearts beat together and their bhow breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursuit for all that flight mister hoopdriver was in the world of a romance had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit
728,831-130746-0054.flac,she said with a laugh to break the intensity he opened his mouth and shut it again and with a sudden wincing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine she looked down at him
729,831-130746-0059.flac,i suppose you won't take anything jessie the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jesse like that but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit good night siss he said and pleasant dreams
730,831-130746-0047.flac,to be a human being not a thing in a hutch and he i know said hoopdriver and now here i am i will do anything said hoopdriver she thought you cannot imagine my stepmother no i could not describe her
731,831-130746-0020.flac,knickerbockers went kers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths
732,831-130746-0050.flac,you would make me your brother miss beaumont yes we could stop there together she took a minute to answer i am going to light these lamps said hoopdriver he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe
733,831-130746-0014.flac,then with infinitinfinite fervour he said but let us put in blank cartridge he said i might have thought thought thought he flung himself into the armchair damn her said bechamel for all the world like a common man
734,831-130746-0051.flac,grave and intent how could she ever have thought him have thought him common or absurd but you must tell me your name brother she said er carrington said mister hoopdriver after a momentary pause
735,831-130746-0019.flac,and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all for all that the girl had escapal had escaped through her stepmother in which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil hour of explanation with his wet and with his wife indefinitely postponed
736,831-130746-0025.flac,and midhurst and haselmire and gildford and riply an end endly and putney and follow this dear fool of a hoopdriver of ours and and his young lady in grey out upon the moonlit road how they rode
737,831-130746-0018.flac,she had evidently gone off with him and that little business was over and he was here stranded and sold
738,831-130746-0037.flac,white dust hohot underfoot blinding to the eye is now a soft grey silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlay in its silver here and there overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence
739,831-130746-0060.flac,but this was living indeed he told himself
740,831-130746-0045.flac,he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic it's an ugly name he said but you are right in trusting me i would i would do anything for you this
741,831-130746-0007.flac,they listened together his they listened together his they listened together his feet stopped turned went out of the dining room depped down the passage to the bedroom stopped again poor chap said the barmaid she's a wicked woman sh sh said stephen
742,831-130746-0028.flac,it was rescue elopement glory as rescue elopement glory as rescue elopement glory and she by the side of him he had seen her face in shadow
743,831-130746-0039.flac,nowhere was the moon shining quite so abrightly as in mister hoopdriver's skull at the at the turnings of the road he made his decision with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard the right he would say or again
744,831-130746-0035.flac,and now they faced northwards and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and cheek there is a magic quality in moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden
745,831-130746-0057.flac,but that night he was in the mood to dare anything so you found your young lady at last said the ostler of the red hotel
746,831-130746-0000.flac,the ostler being a fool rushed violently down the road vociferating after them then he returned panting to the vicuna hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up stopped to give them the cream of the adventure
747,831-130746-0034.flac,he looked sidewas at her as she sat beside him with her ankle gracefully ruling the treddles now the road turned westward and she was a dark grey outline against the shimmer of the moon
748,831-130746-0015.flac,i'll chuck this infernal business they've gone eh yes sir yes sir yes sir
749,831-130746-0040.flac,the left as one who knew so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea
750,831-130746-0048.flac,i am entirely at your service i will help you with all my power houer i have lost an allution and found a knight errant she spoke of bechame chmchmel as the illusion mister hoopdriver felt flattered but he had no adequate answer
751,831-130746-0013.flac,but as yet he seemed merely stunned brown clothes he said and fairish a little like yourself sir in the dark the ostler sir jim duke
752,831-130746-0036.flac,it has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again it rises again it rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy route
753,831-130746-0053.flac,the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely she had to speak
754,831-130746-0012.flac,another gentleman who another gentleman in brown sir went into the yard sir got out the two bicycles sir and went off sir about twenty minutes ago bechamel stood with his eyes round and his knuckle on his hips
755,831-130746-0010.flac,if so he was in for an exexplanation but he had it ready she was a monomaniac leave me alone with her he would say i know how to calm her missus beaumont said stephen well has gone
756,831-130746-0004.flac,making a sudden and awe stricken silence appeared bechamel in the hall beyn the hall be the hall beyond the bar walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and passed out of sight you conceive the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium
757,831-130746-0041.flac,hullo said mister hoopdriver sawd ovoca they disthey disthey dismounted abruptly stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either eiher either either side
758,831-130746-0011.flac,he rose with a fine surprise gone he said hun he said un he said with a half laugh gone sir on her bicycle on her bicycle why she went sir with another gentleman this time bechamel was really startled
759,831-130746-0006.flac,it wasn't that one at all miss said the ostler i'd swear well that's mister beauwont said the barmaid anyhow their conversation hung comatose in the air switched up by bechamel
760,831-130746-0031.flac,they scarcely heeded whither they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewy night pale and intricate and high
761,831-130746-0002.flac,there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contribute contribute contributions there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse that made ten minutes
762,831-130746-0001.flac,that gave the fugitives five minutes then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the bar maid what the matter her her er was and the governor being out they spent some more precious time wondering whatever was to be done
763,831-130746-0023.flac,the moonlight ride and so the twenty minutes law passed into an infinity
764,831-130746-0016.flac,making a memorable saying let em go who cares and i wish him luck and bring me some bourban as fast as you can there's a good chap
765,831-130746-0021.flac,he banged the arms of the chair with his fist arms of the chair with his fists and swore again
766,831-130746-0044.flac,are you tired he asked i will do what has to be done the two black figures in the broken light were silent for a pace do you know she said i am not afraid of you i am sure you are honest to me
767,831-130746-0052.flac,who would be hoopdriver on a night like this but the christian name christian name my christian name well chris he snapped his lamp and stood up if you will hold my machine i will light yours he said
768,831-130746-0003.flac,then stephen the waiter who had shown hoopdriver up came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question which that turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour and in the midst of this discussion
769,831-130746-0009.flac,as without knocking stephen entered bechamel's face suggested a different expectation beg pardon sir said stephen with a diplomatic cough well said bechamel wondering suddenly if jessie had kept some of her threats
770,831-130739-0061.flac,hoopdriver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it never oil the steering it's fatal
771,831-130739-0056.flac,was was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark briggs had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt hoopdriver's inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him him hm hm have the machine thoroughly well oiled said briggs
772,831-130739-0035.flac,a gasping a grunting a shouting of steer man steer a wavering unsteady flight a spasmodic turning of the missile edifice of man and machine and a collapse then you descry dimly through the dusk
773,831-130739-0058.flac,save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe and then break out with an entirely disitly diftly different set of tips avoid running over dogs hoopdriver whatever you do
774,831-130739-0041.flac,the assistant is dreaming of the delicious time only four hours off now when he will resume the tale of his brute brute bruises and abrasions the apprentice is nearer the long long thoughts of boyhood and his imagination rides cop a pie
775,831-130739-0049.flac,the next in the strict scale of precedence of the draperiemporium mister hoopdr themdrdr the driver in alternating spasms anon straightens his gingham and anon becomes meditative with his his meditative with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom tooth
776,831-130739-0054.flac,i'm getting fairly safe upon it now he told miss howe at other times hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity
777,831-130739-0039.flac,and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins gins to straighten them punctiliously and near him is an apprentice apprenticed to the same high calling of drapers assistant
778,831-130739-0052.flac,said hoopdriver as calmly as possible pulling the insufficient moustache
779,831-130739-0053.flac,you stowit said mister hoopdriver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice ired and threateningly at the junior apprentice hired and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt
780,831-130739-0055.flac,when the gas was turned gas was turned gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and a very big place and studying a road map of the south of england
781,831-130739-0046.flac,how about this day week hoopdriver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the the hethe corners of his gingham folds in his hands his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations patients atients can he learn it in a week that's the question
782,831-130739-0033.flac,until sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old fashioned affair with a fork instead of a diamond frame a cushioned tire well worn on the hind wheel
783,831-130739-0042.flac,through the chambers of his brain seeking some knightly quest in honour of that fair thfair fair lady the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dressmaking upstairs
784,831-130739-0057.flac,carry one or or two lemons with you don't tear yourself to death the first day and sit up right never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity you mind those things and nothing very much can't happen to you hoopdriver you take my word
785,831-130739-0048.flac,all drapers have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the biau ye washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you the decision comes at last
786,831-130739-0037.flac,to to to to seek the wholesome delight of exertion and danger and pain and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man to which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end
787,831-130739-0032.flac,two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in learne earn earne earning such as one might such as one might such as one might expect in a person unused to muscular exercise blisters on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering rider and so forth
788,831-130739-0036.flac,thus even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself and drive him against all the conditions of his calling against the counsels of prudence and the restrictions of his means
789,831-130739-0051.flac,i said hoopdriver when the question came to him why cycling of course you are never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours day after day said miss howe of the costume department i am
790,831-130739-0059.flac,never let the machine buckle there was a man killed honly the other day through his wheel buckling don't scorch don't ride on the footpath keep your own side of the road and if you see a tram line go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county
791,831-130739-0034.flac,rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from roehampton to putney hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel
792,831-130739-0038.flac,but enough of these revelations the central figure of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be backed by the senior porter and sent to you
793,831-130739-0062.flac,a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying and clean the chain daily with black lead you mind just a few little le things like that
794,831-130739-0045.flac,the shopwalker brings up parallel to the counter any particular time when you want your holidays he asks hoopdriver pulls at his skimpy moustache no don't want them too late sir of course
795,831-130739-0044.flac,they're going fairly well sir
796,831-130739-0043.flac,he inclines rather to street fighting to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice iper in his hand the apprentice kiper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
797,831-130739-0040.flac,a ruddy red haired lad in a very short tailless black coat and a very high collar who was deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of creton
798,831-130739-0050.flac,at supper that night holiday talk held held undisputed sway mister pritchard spoke of scotland miss isaacs clamoured abot
799,831-130739-0060.flac,and always light up before dark you mind just to and find just a find just a few little things like that hoopdriver and nothing geting gettng much can't happen to you you take my word right you are said hoopdriver good night old man good night said briggs
800,831-130739-0047.flac,otherwise briggs will get next week and he will have to wait until september when the weather is often uncertain he is naturally of a sanguine disposition
801,831-130739-0027.flac,one might fancy that he had been sitting with he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a thrushing machine say or one of those haymaking furies but sherlock holmes
802,831-130739-0001.flac,a perfectly fictitious co by the by of putney on the fourteenth of august eighteen ninety fye had turned to the right hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend
803,831-130739-0028.flac,would have fancied nothing of the kind
804,831-130739-0031.flac,forupon on every one of them waits the jest of the unexpected treddle you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and whack you are rubbing your shin so out of innocence we ripen
805,831-130739-0025.flac,he had indeed been bumped and battered at an extraordinary extraordinary number of points but enough of realistic description is as good as a feast feast
806,831-130739-0012.flac,sin then then a puffy little chop walker would have come into view
807,831-130739-0023.flac,the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvell in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the on the interior aspect of the knee so far we may proceed with our details

943,8238-274553-0070.flac,and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow shadow of meaning it it it existed the key to the whole was found in lehaving out every second and third word alternately

945,8238-274553-0024.flac,during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening
946,8238-274553-0007.flac,that very extraordinary  ordinary eftrordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung then of no no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any dada personally afforded
947,8238-274553-0048.flac,as her as herman went out the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business
948,8238-274553-0035.flac,your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member
949,8238-274553-0066.flac,to assure him er him fer him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron

957,8098-275181-0003.flac,and by day they wandered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beech nuts which were very plentiful that fall all went well till the last week in october when on taking the senses one morning a turkey was found to be missing
958,8098-275181-0031.flac,i just determined to have it out with him considering the fact that a fox is a very active sharp biting animal and that this was an unusually large male i have always thought tom got off very well
959,8098-275181-0013.flac,each a watch a watch a wad of fine dry grass as large as a quart box these were gathered up and filled the great basket there said he triumphantly don't them smell mousy they did certainly

964,8098-275181-0001.flac,to call the real mice out of their grass nests o mice out of their grass nests o mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps this indeed is a favorite trick of reynyard at the tie to come totime of my story my friend tom edwards ten years of age
965,8098-275181-0023.flac,made by sucking the air sharply madely between his teeth now be off said tom and do  come poking around nor get in sight till you hear me holler
966,8098-275181-0000.flac,their sharp cur like barks used often to rouse us and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields mousing around the stone heaps making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse
967,8098-275181-0008.flac,this theory received something of thing of thing of a check when our flock counted only twenty nine the next morning there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter
968,8098-275181-0009.flac,no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact it was clear that something must be done and at once too
969,8098-275181-0011.flac,it would take far too much spaze to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks i recol i recol i recollect that we set three traps for him to no purpose
970,8098-275181-0010.flac,or ruin would swallow up the poultry firm rightly or wrongly we attributed the mischief to a certain silver gray that had several times been seen in the neighborhood that autumn
971,8098-275181-0021.flac,with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stone heaps were and where we had oftenest heard foxes bark selecting a nook in the edge in the edgein the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump
972,8098-275181-0027.flac,he said not a word but left me to poke about and stumble stumble on the limp warm carcasse of a large fox that lay near bike ye i exclaimed after sat at satisfying myself that the fox was dead some said tom
973,8098-275181-0032.flac,i do not think that he think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again however we sold the fox skin in the village and received thirteen dollars teen dollars for it whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than three dollars
974,8098-275181-0033.flac,how or by what wiles that fox got the turkeys out of the high butter nut is a secret
975,8098-275181-0015.flac,well look here then i'll show ye said he
976,8098-275181-0005.flac,tom thought it was the twombly boys nepharious iissssam in particular i thought it might have been an owl but under the tree in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug we found fox tracks
977,8098-275181-0030.flac,these numerous bites however were followed by no serious ill effects the next day ta tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass that he had caught hold of one of its hind legs
978,8098-275181-0018.flac,inside the nest in inest evidently there were mice in it and feeling my character as fox at stake i at once trotted forward then crept up and as the rustling and squeaking continued made a pounce into the grast
979,8098-275181-0024.flac,and being amidst nice cozy straw i presently went to sleep quite unquite unand quite unintentionally i must have slept some time though it seemed to me but a very few minutes what woke me was a noise a sharp suppressed yelp
980,8098-275181-0002.flac,and myself and myself and and myself were in the turkey business equal partners we owned a flock of thirty oock of thirty ock of thirty one turkeys these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house in the very top of it
981,8098-275181-0007.flac,and a casualty such as turkey razers are unavoidably airs to and we bore our loss with resignation we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roosts
982,8098-275181-0020.flac,then in dumb show knocked my head with a stoune d'you see now he demanded i saw but a fox would bite you i objected let him bite said tom
983,8098-275181-0019.flac,as i had heard  heard it said that foxes did when mousing instantly two spry brown hands an and srom out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip as a fox i struggled tremendously
984,8098-275181-0028.flac,and that was all i coul that was all i could get from him that night we took the fox to the house and lighted a candle it was the silveror gray tom washed his bite in cold water and went and went to bed
985,8098-275181-0017.flac,and with it completely covered himself an covered himself and covered himself the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest or rather a small haycock
986,8098-275181-0006.flac,and two or three ominous little wads of feathers with one one one an one long ta ta a tail feather adrift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butter nut had a fit perhaps
987,8098-275181-0014.flac,they savored as strongly of mice as tom's question of bad grammar and don't foxes catch mice demanded tom confidently yes but i don't see how that's going to catch a fox i said
988,8098-275181-0022.flac,tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contencompletely with the contencompletely with the contents of the big basket he then practised squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all all was in good trim his squeaks were perfect successes

1183,78-369-0063.flac,sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broke yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete so replete with anguish
1184,78-369-0057.flac,and i was left drifting andng ing on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death
1185,78-369-0050.flac,despair had indeed almost almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath have sunk beneath have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil
1186,78-369-0045.flac,amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant
1187,78-369-0046.flac,my rage and in vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overoverwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge
1188,78-369-0049.flac,i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops is of despondency and grief from my eyes
1189,78-369-0051.flac,gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain in ice mountain ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i i viewed the expanse before me with fore me with ore me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain
1190,78-369-0047.flac,i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment
1191,78-369-0061.flac,oh when will my guiding spirit and conduct and conducting me to the demon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i st i so much desire or must i uest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do
1192,78-369-0054.flac,when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey
1193,78-369-0053.flac,warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the demon but still my sight eight was dimmed by the burning drops until
1194,78-369-0062.flac,wear to me walton that he shall not escape that you that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no
1195,78-369-0052.flac,what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within
1196,78-369-0059.flac,i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and vessels ever came so far north and vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship
1197,78-369-0056.flac,as with the might mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work wa work was work was soon finished in a few minutes it a as a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy
1198,78-369-0055.flac,my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before
1199,78-369-0048.flac,which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
1200,78-369-0058.flac,several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw i soi tait saw your vessel riding at anchor
1201,78-369-0060.flac,but your direction was northward you took me on board when my vigour was exhaust au exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplolotlied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled
1202,78-369-0005.flac,uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it
1203,78-369-0001.flac,my first resolution was to lutian was to quit geneva forever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful
1204,78-369-0042.flac,concerning the fiend and gained accurate rate information a gigantic monster they scnisly said had arrived the night before armed with a guc n guc an gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage
1205,78-369-0017.flac,scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die let let left some mark to guide me
1206,78-369-0013.flac,it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains re echoed it and i felt as if all hell srfall hell surfall hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter
1207,78-369-0026.flac,and that i should then enjoy reality ty in the arms of my dearest friends what agonizing fondness did i feel for them
1208,78-369-0022.flac,i always presented to those who had provided provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed life as it passed ife as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy oh blessed sleep
1209,78-369-0033.flac,and no fish could be could be procured and thus i was cut off for my chief article of mainten ief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of m   iculty of my liculty of my labours
1210,78-369-0030.flac,where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place pase spase if you follow not too tardily a dead hare
1211,78-369-0027.flac,and pursuade myself that they still ill ill ill lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the demon more as a task enjoined by heaven
1212,78-369-0020.flac,that restored and inspirited me the fare was the fare was the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate
1213,78-369-0010.flac,which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you you you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work
1214,78-369-0032.flac,the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most harty ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice
1215,78-369-0037.flac,oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness
1216,78-369-0019.flac,would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sunk under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert
1217,78-369-0035.flac,will satisfy ty thoht by my everlasting hatred my courage and g and g and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words
1218,78-369-0043.flac,through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs
1219,78-369-0009.flac,on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and ep and epand eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the demon
1220,78-369-0011.flac,deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adjuration with solemnity deep solemnity solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends
1221,78-369-0002.flac,i provided myself with a sum of money together with a fw together with a fw together with a few jew fw jew few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life
1222,78-369-0012.flac,herd and approve herd and approve  herd and approve my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance
1223,78-369-0029.flac,these words were ahes words were tahis words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north
1224,78-369-0000.flac,chapter twenty four my present situation was one in which all all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury
1225,78-369-0040.flac,some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed
1226,78-369-0015.flac,i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards a spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp
1227,78-369-0028.flac,as the mechanical impulse of some power ulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of desire of desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know
1228,78-369-0003.flac,all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know
1229,78-369-0036.flac,and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon
1230,78-369-0044.flac,he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured
1231,78-369-0014.flac,and that i was reserved for vengeance dance the laughter died away when a welp when a well known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear
1232,78-369-0025.flac,heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice and beheld voice and beheld clervall enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come
1233,78-369-0004.flac,and prayed for death afor death for death but revenge kept me alive live i dare not die and leave my adversvers versary an being when i quitted geneva my first labour
1234,78-369-0021.flac,and vanish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the demon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected
1235,78-369-0038.flac,the greeks wept for joy when they y tay ay beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down
1236,78-369-0034.flac,one inscription that he left was in these words prepare er your toil is only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall we shall we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings
1237,78-369-0024.flac,during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father
1238,78-369-0018.flac,the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his his his his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown
1239,78-369-0016.flac,suddenly the broad disc disc of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly an distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task
1240,78-369-0023.flac,often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage
1241,78-369-0031.flac,again do i vow vengeance again do do do i devote thee miserable fiend to to torture and death never never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy
1242,78-369-0007.flac,an effectectectecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around
1243,78-369-0006.flac,and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn
1244,78-369-0039.flac,and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirits for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped not not notwithstanding my adversaryes gibe to meet and grapple with him
1245,78-369-0041.flac,and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach to the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on asset on heset on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the s s seashore i inquired of the inhabitants
1246,78-369-0008.flac,their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth
1247,78-368-0029.flac,and i must tell in a few words what remain ains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father in earnest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore
1248,78-368-0013.flac,and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon and illuminate the chamber the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described
1249,78-368-0038.flac,my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive
1250,78-368-0042.flac,from the execution of those functions on this occasion
1251,78-368-0039.flac,and this purpose quieted my agant aganagony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now relate my history briefly briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy
1252,78-368-0014.flac,i saw at the open window i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointedtowards the corpse of my wife
1253,78-368-0030.flac,misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way
1254,78-368-0031.flac,sometimes indeed i dreamt that i waed
1255,78-368-0048.flac,i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster eaze the monster ease the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you
1256,78-368-0027.flac,but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate
1257,78-368-0045.flac,since the commission of his crimes and no one and no one and no one can conjecture to what plays he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit
1258,78-368-0003.flac,that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects
1259,78-368-0047.flac,and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he
1260,78-368-0011.flac,to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her
1261,78-368-0041.flac,when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power
1262,78-368-0051.flac,my rage is  rage is e rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer r er whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse to refuse to refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction
1263,78-368-0044.flac,who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice an inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude
1264,78-368-0023.flac,my father even even now might be writhing under his grasp and earnest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action
1265,78-368-0040.flac,and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested
1266,78-368-0002.flac,the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless wavs
1267,78-368-0015.flac,but he eluded me leapd from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room
1268,78-368-0020.flac,and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time noticed all this time noticed all this tme no distinct idea presented itself to my mind
1269,78-368-0017.flac,after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties is going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceed a short distance from the house
1270,78-368-0032.flac,melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation
1271,78-368-0043.flac,i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance
1272,78-368-0025.flac,however it was hard however it was hard however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night
1273,78-368-0046.flac,and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps hhe he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative
1274,78-368-0018.flac,a film covered my eyes and my my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room
1275,78-368-0026.flac,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the daydadayday before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man
1276,78-368-0052.flac,i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed
1277,78-368-0019.flac,as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i rose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it
1278,78-368-0001.flac,the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west in the west in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend

1280,78-368-0053.flac,how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease
1281,78-368-0034.flac,and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my d that i might have him within my  that i might have him within my grasp to reak a great
1282,78-368-0036.flac,and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exquired him to exquired him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer
1283,78-368-0022.flac,the murder of ciurder of cliurder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend
1284,78-368-0016.flac,nets were cat at at ast but in vain after passing several hours we re we re we returned hopeless
1285,78-368-0035.flac,revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose
1286,78-368-0021.flac,subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was i was bewildered in a in a in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine
1287,78-368-0005.flac,when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended
1288,78-368-0008.flac,she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms in relaxed form
1289,78-368-0050.flac,but all that i can say i can say i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice
1290,78-368-0007.flac,great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope
1291,78-368-0004.flac,and not shrank from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence
1292,78-368-0000.flac,chapter twenty three it was eight o'clock when we land o'clock when we landed we walked for a short short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn
1293,78-368-0024.flac,there were no horses to be procured and i must must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents
1294,78-368-0049.flac,have yourself described to be his properties tha ties tha hatties that this will prove impracticable and thus while and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be
1295,78-368-0012.flac,but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck
1296,78-368-0006.flac,i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs the state lasted but for an instant
1297,78-368-0009.flac,flung by the murderer on its bridal beer r er could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated
1298,78-368-0037.flac,however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood
1299,78-368-0010.flac,but the horror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them

1312,7780-274562-0069.flac,it is easily easly easily understood said mister ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a general and more distantly observed effect
1313,7780-274562-0087.flac,appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes in flames in invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results

1316,7780-274562-0081.flac,from what i have already have already have already observed said mister ellison innenyou will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country
1317,7780-274562-0067.flac,it was mister ellison who first first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty
1318,7780-274562-0105.flac,that ellison thought to find and found find and found find and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity
1319,7780-274562-0083.flac,what is said in respect to the detecting in bringing into practice those nice relations of relations of size proportion in color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much y mean much yo mean much or little or nothing

1449,7517-100437-0026.flac,published last year it was i who introduced that novelist to it six months before punce before indeed i feel sometimes that it was i who wrote the wind in the willows
1450,7517-100437-0027.flac,and recommended it to kenneth graham it to kenneth graham it to kenneth graham but perhaps i am wrong here for i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance nor as i have already lamented ready lamented ready lamented am i financially interested in its sale

1454,7517-100437-0034.flac,still less on the genius of kenneth graham you are merely sitting in judgment on n yourself you may be worthy i do not know
1455,7517-100437-0017.flac,for the last last last ten or twelve years i have been recommending it usually i speak about it at my first meeting with a stranger it is my opening remark just as yours is something futile about the weather
1456,7517-100437-0020.flac,would probably pretend tha woully pretend that he had read it but he wouldn't deceive me for one cannot recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering

1459,7517-100437-0028.flac,an explanation which suspicious strangers require from me sometimes i shall not describe the book for no description would help it but i shall just say this
1460,7517-100437-0011.flac,of a well known writer when i tell you his name you will say oh yes i love his books and uks and you will mention so and so and its equally famous sequel such and such

1463,7517-100437-0000.flac,a household book once on a time i discovered samuel butler not butler not abutler not the other two but t two but the one who wrote the way of all flesh the second best novel in the english language
1464,7517-100437-0015.flac,are the golden aon age and dream days am i not right thank you but the book you have not read my book
1465,7517-100437-0007.flac,in borrowing the classic upon which you were were were brought up this is this is too much for me let us say no more about it
1466,7517-100437-0010.flac,of a book book book which should be a classic but is not of a book of which nobody has heard unless through me it was published some twelve published some twelve published some twelve years ago the last published book
1467,7517-100437-0033.flac,but i must give you one word of warning when you sit down to it do't be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting who are sitting in judgment on my taste
1468,7517-100437-0019.flac,my answer to the question whether i had anything to say would be well my lord lod lord if i might just recommend i might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving mister justice darling
1469,7517-100437-0003.flac,in two glowing articles not not not unnaturally the world remained unmoved it knew all about samuel butler last week i discovered a frenchman
1470,7517-100429-0012.flac,where the people who have been writing a few letters after breakfast may when they have finished meet those who have no intention of writing any and arrange plans with them for the morning
1471,7517-100429-0026.flac,er i was just going to er walk about a bit but now we tell her brightly i'm going to see the pond it must be nearly full won't you come to and with any luck she comes
1472,7517-100429-0030.flac,will help to celebrate it i have no doubt with and will then open air play tank drama drama drama or what not at any rate we have every every hope that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible
1473,7517-100429-0028.flac,what will will happen then aldenham may know but we his guests do not some think there will be merely a flood over the sursrsurrounding paths and the kitchen garden but for myself
1474,7517-100429-0005.flac,thus the steps help the steps helpd to make the pond a convenient rain gauge for obviousl ch for obviousl h for obviously when only three steps are left uncovered as was the case last monday
1475,7517-100429-0009.flac,has done the damage the soul yearns for something more startling than that the record of the pond
1476,7517-100429-0003.flac,it is known simply as known simply as known simply as the pond a designation which ignores the existence of several neighboring ponds the gifts of natenae nature and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man
1477,7517-100429-0027.flac,to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond for there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full
1478,7517-100429-0021.flac,to be disinclined to leave it till lunch time till lunch time a man or woman as lazy as this must not be rushed say to such a one come and play and the invitation
1479,7517-100429-0031.flac,so that we may so that we may so that we may watch it fill again i must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond but all the same
1480,7517-100429-0025.flac,yet if our hostess were to see us marching out with an umbrella how odd she would think us where are you off to she would ask and we could only answer lamely
1481,7517-100429-0016.flac,we have have a little argument about it miss robinson being convinced that she stood on the see second step after breakfast and miss smith repeating that it looks
1482,7517-100429-0018.flac,must be a record but but anyhow it is fairly fine now and what about a little lawn tennis or golf or croquet or and so the arrangements for the morning are made
1483,7517-100429-0029.flac,i believe that we are promised something much bigger than that a man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives
1484,7517-100429-0004.flac,for the pond is just a is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious there are seven steps to the bottom of the pond and each step
1485,7517-100429-0015.flac,we wander down to the pond together and perhaps find brown and miss smith there a lot of rain in the night says brown it was only just over the third step after lunch yesterday
1486,7517-100429-0014.flac,right o do yo do she says willingly enough having spent the last quarter of an hour with the time's financial supplement all of the paper that is left to the women in the first rush for the cricket news
1487,7517-100429-0024.flac,from morning till night how tired we free we get of being indoors on these days even with the best of books the the the pleasantest of companions the easiest of billiard tables
1488,7517-100429-0002.flac,a resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the zoo beneath the waters of which if you particularly desire to point the hippopotamus out to somebody he always lies hidden to the rest of us
1489,7517-100429-0000.flac,the pond my friend aldenhamhamham's pond stands stands stands at a convenient distance from the house and is reached by a well well drained gravel path so that in any weather one may walk
1490,7517-100429-0032.flac,have fallen in the last three weeks
1491,7517-100429-0011.flac,and planned the pond accordingly a most necessary thing in a nnanacountry house is that there should be a recognized meeting place
1492,7517-100429-0017.flac,by and by two or three others strol up and we all make measurements together the trements together the general opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night
1493,7517-100429-0022.flac,will be declined say come willind say come ind say come and look at the pond and the worst sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise and once he is out he is out
1494,7517-100429-0001.flac,alone or in company dry spony dry sony dry shod to its brink in estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen in the night the rybald call it the hippopotamus pond tracing
1495,7517-100429-0008.flac,for when your whole day day day's cricket has been spoilt it is perfectly absurd
1496,7517-100429-0010.flac,soothes us where the record a record of the ordinary pedantic raingauge would leave us infuriated hus infuriated tus infurated it it speaks much for my friend aldenham's breadth of view that he understood this
1497,7517-100429-0007.flac,drain secretly into the pond and secretly into the pond too this seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers
1498,7517-100429-0006.flac,when the pond began to fill to strangers this may seem surprising and it is only fair to tell them the great secret which is that much sthat much sthat much of the surrounding land
1499,7517-100429-0013.flac,ah a i am one of those who cannot write letters in another man's man's house and when my pipe is well alight i say to miss robinson or whoever it may may may be let's go and look at the pond
1500,7517-100429-0023.flac,all this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents
1501,7517-100429-0020.flac,fills you with thoughts of revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before but indoors it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast and once there with all the papers
1502,7517-100429-0019.flac,and they can be made more readily out of doors for supposing it is fine the fresh air calls you to be doing something and the sight of the newly marked tennis lawn
1503,7113-86041-0097.flac,this time to his great annoyance than great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time now the number was not the same as either of the the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princess's
1504,7113-86041-0085.flac,unless he could be for ever chattering
1505,7113-86041-0079.flac,caught him in her cruel beak and becefore he could say caword he had disappeared down her throat these two unlucky unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more
1506,7113-86041-0104.flac,echo answered in the marble hulls there was neither voice nor footstep then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortl form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace
1507,7113-86041-0100.flac,into the arms of her  her her beloved prince ratibor meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and inter and over again an en ten till his back ached and his head swam and he could no longer put two and two together
1508,7113-86041-0105.flac,and soared hig and and hig and high into the air and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions furiously
1509,7113-86041-0103.flac,but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole but but every hole and corner and calling her by name but only
1510,7113-86041-0099.flac,which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bride ride ri ridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley andflung herself
1511,7113-86041-0090.flac,and her flowing and her flowing veil sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes
1512,7113-86041-0094.flac,ask some some some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience an my patience to some test by which you whh you can judge of my unalterable love be it so answered the crafty maiden then give me
1513,7113-86041-0096.flac,he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper he nimble as a grasshopper he nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again
1514,7113-86041-0078.flac,but that but but i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains so the cricket hopped off gaily determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a long legged stork who was prancing along the same road
1515,7113-86041-0081.flac,and bid him come with horses and men the the the third day from this to the hill hill that rises from the thorny valley the magpie listened hopped awhile from branch to branch branch and then darted away
1516,7113-86041-0083.flac,which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory forever thereupon he caught up a great stone
1517,7113-86041-0084.flac,but the magpie in the tree who like
1518,7113-86041-0095.flac,that shall be the test of your be the test of your truth towards me unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task
1519,7113-86041-0088.flac,she left off do dof doff treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love o of jov and the idea pleased him mightily the next day
1520,7113-86041-0077.flac,then and there after that erafter that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting hop little cricket to ratibor and chirp in his ear that i love him only
1521,7113-86041-0106.flac,and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years and but his fury was vain the thunder clouds melted away into a soft mist
1522,7113-86041-0107.flac,and the gnome and and after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the four winds his and to the four winds his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stole once more through every room with many sighs and lamentations
1523,7113-86041-0087.flac,while the prince hurried back to his castle together together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall the princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of scape
1524,7113-86041-0082.flac,now prince ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief one day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud
1525,7113-86041-0080.flac,this time she changed the turnip into a into a magpie flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said said she till you come to ratibor my love
1526,7113-86041-0086.flac,all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment and he anxiously questioned the questioned the questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess but the magpie knew no more than the lesson o more than the lesson o more than the lesson he had learnt so he soon fluttered away
1527,7113-86041-0110.flac,to the depths of his underground kingdom
1528,7113-86041-0108.flac,he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princess's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief all was lonely empty sorrowful
1529,7113-86041-0098.flac,pretty looks and words as for the maiden no sooner was her  no sooner was her no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she she she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand
1530,7113-86041-0089.flac,as soon as the sun rose she made her appearance decked as a bride in the wodod in the wd in the wonderful robes and jewels which the fond nome had prepared for her her her her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle blossoms
1531,7113-86041-0109.flac,and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no no no more dealings with such false creatures
1532,7113-86041-0101.flac,but as he felt tolerably certain of the exact number of turnips in the field big and little together he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be he felt very well satisfied with himself
1533,7113-86041-0093.flac,and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now
1534,7113-86041-0102.flac,as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had as as he had an had left her but alas she was no longer there he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond
1535,7113-86041-0091.flac,your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears why tears beloved one cried the gnome anxiously
1536,7113-86041-0092.flac,every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold greatly as i desire your love i do not re ev ask a sacrifice eerevera sacrifice ah cried the false princess why do you misunderstand my tears
1537,7113-86041-0002.flac,for rbrebazl loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing
1538,7113-86041-0010.flac,and where among the hills to look for for for any who strayed away that they too prospered undeand  under under his care and not one was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well earned wages
1539,7113-86041-0023.flac,as the wandering breeze scattered it daisies and forget me nots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable
1540,7113-86041-0071.flac,looking forward to the coming of their wedding day whe te bride's mysterious disappearance looked disappearance look disappearance took place the sad news drove ratibor distracted and as the llthe days went on and nothing could be heard of the princess he forsook his castle
1541,7113-86041-0035.flac,they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her fathers seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch
1542,7113-86041-0057.flac,lay the once frolicsome beny with all four four four feete stretched stiffly out while the llefitte stretched stiffly out while the lefitte stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion the horrified princess fled to the door
1543,7113-86041-0024.flac,were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes
1544,7113-86041-0050.flac,the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon and keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before
1545,7113-86041-0014.flac,beyond them flowed a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide
1546,7113-86041-0059.flac,sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will do but do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots
1547,7113-86041-0005.flac,and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounded cosy looking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows
1548,7113-86041-0067.flac,and then without fail you shall have your poppets to play with almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without deigning to answer him the gnome however
1549,7113-86041-0017.flac,when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young man that was the best way and he fell in love with ta girl then and there
1550,7113-86041-0043.flac,carips turnips and c turnips and radishes and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who sat qs who sat pensive in the shade of de qitefdef the rosebower loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow
1551,7113-86041-0016.flac,he could could could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as ha raven feels and a nest a field mice at the foot of the of th of the of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens
1552,7113-86041-0041.flac,and in a thousand waves strove to dispel the strove to dispel th strove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants
1553,7113-86041-0036.flac,wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who ho who whispered the sweetest beeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he it was told her all about himself
1554,7113-86041-0015.flac,the sight of the maiden so pleased the nome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven
1555,7113-86041-0027.flac,which certainly did look very very very inviting and they all went gaily to this new amusement the princess was ready first but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down down down she sank
1556,7113-86041-0075.flac,just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another ther purpose in view one day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover fly
1557,7113-86041-0011.flac,so he ran away and went to serve the judge here served the judge here served the judge here he upheld the law with might and main and was a terror to thieves and evil doers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law

1559,7113-86041-0063.flac,to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to to to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found
1560,7113-86041-0032.flac,the glittering grotto described to him by him by the maidens had completely vanished and so hade the marble the marble marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old
1561,7113-86041-0020.flac,stepping out of his hiding place
1562,7113-86041-0062.flac,and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women ndwrinkled old women and wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were erer to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow
1563,7113-86041-0001.flac,and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks ansome built strong br barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies
1564,7113-86041-0056.flac,and started back at the sight o of a group of shrivelled crones with bent backs and trembling limbs mms who supported their tottering steps with staves and isansan crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth
1565,7113-86041-0034.flac,sprite or goblin and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy
1566,7113-86041-0054.flac,while brunilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away
1567,7113-86041-0040.flac,but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome however he soon perceived her melancholy
1568,7113-86041-0048.flac,the gnome had given to his hoped for bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes veils girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired
1569,7113-86041-0058.flac,the greatest greatest the greatest delight of my lonely hours isn't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your their their turning the castle into a hospital for the aged give my maidens back tho the the  youth and health this very minute or i will never love you
1570,7113-86041-0064.flac,by the trolists of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off

1618,7067-76048-0053.flac,still quite vaguely guessing so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as illusions or by way of illustration

1620,7067-76048-0002.flac,section two for th section two for the better part of forty hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence

1626,7067-76048-0056.flac,but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with doctor martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings
1627,7067-76048-0029.flac,gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives
1628,7067-76048-0044.flac,at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mister miste mister grammont's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost
1629,7067-76048-0045.flac,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all
1630,7067-76048-0047.flac,after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and ainto a shirt waist and an office down town she had been town she had been intrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mister grammont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard

1632,7067-76048-0021.flac,it's it's it's refreshing to meet you i found it refreshing to meet martineau a twinge of conscience about doctor martineau turned sir richmond into a new channel he's a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects

1646,7067-76048-0008.flac,to a happy use by clamering to the top of it and sliding on their little beehinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing
1647,7067-76048-0004.flac,but she was interested in and curious about the people she had had had met in life and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences and her liking for sir richmond was pleasingly manifest
1648,7067-76048-0012.flac,her imagination glowed her imagination glowed her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice i believe what you say is possible if if people dare i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them

1651,7067-76048-0025.flac,making them matter tereter as formerly they didn't seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by has to go by the board i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before

1654,7067-76048-0000.flac,i leave you i leave you i leave you to it his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation this overnight irritation ought you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond i shall be interested to learn what happens but if you won't stay to see
1655,7067-76048-0035.flac,he felt that he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being charming human being charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments
1656,7067-76048-0060.flac,and replaceable structures indeed both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before
1657,7067-76048-0051.flac,and the idea of a the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him and of speaking about him that suggested that in some way
1658,7067-76048-0043.flac,father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towwards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son
1659,7067-76048-0018.flac,i do not know why it should be so but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind i want it as my culminating want i want a world in order
1660,7067-76048-0036.flac,in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality martineau was very fine minded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he he saw man and woman in every encounter

1663,7067-76048-0055.flac,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to doctor martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that doctor martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him
1664,7067-76047-0019.flac,may involve very mysterious consequences indeed with which i for one do may not wish to be involved sir richmond upon the hearth rug had a curious feeling that he was bakback back back in the head master's study at caxton
1665,7067-76047-0029.flac,she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss grammont is not silly
1666,7067-76047-0006.flac,on the second occasion sir richmond smiled smiled smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling

1669,7067-76047-0041.flac,you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends you on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leads

1671,7067-76047-0007.flac,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair
1672,7067-76047-0004.flac,for a moment he had a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the ly the preparation of an ultimatum i object to miss grammont on onont and that side of the thing more than i do to miss seyffert
1673,7067-76047-0033.flac,she would find in ind that life was worth while to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous a monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her the facility of her sex she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worth while for him
1674,7067-76047-0031.flac,and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was twenty i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presents those who seek find
1675,7067-76047-0024.flac,her manner with miss seyffert an excellent manner for miss seyffert by the by isn't the sort of manner any of manner any o manner any one acquires in a day or for one person on't only she is a very sure and commanding young woman sir richmond nodded
1676,7067-76047-0020.flac,and in  in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favored with very much of her her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile
1677,7067-76047-0018.flac,this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves admit behaves as if that if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more
1678,7067-76047-0048.flac,and at present the work and workand world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the the core of this situation a pause fell between the two gentlemen

1683,7067-76047-0026.flac,it is a sort of moral laziness masquerad as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her her her place and she was petted honoured amused
1684,7067-76047-0027.flac,talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time i think this must be near the tottruth of her biography said sir richmond
1685,7067-76047-0011.flac,am i said i said i said doctor martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on ttalking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted so sir richmond admitted so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party
1686,7067-76047-0032.flac,what do you think she found what would a rich girl find out there in america i don't know i haven't the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction
1687,7067-76047-0028.flac,i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them
1688,7067-76047-0046.flac,from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing are men and women to go on for ever separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds
1689,7067-76047-0003.flac,she could for example be left behind with the luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammont there was no immediate reply
1690,7067-76047-0038.flac,she sees history is history as you see it and i see it she is a very grown up young woman it's just that said sir richmond it's just that if you see as much in miss grammont as all that why don't you want to come on with us you see the interest of her
1691,7067-76047-0012.flac,there were some moments of silence silence silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note note note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said doctor mrblemma said doctor marblemma said doctor martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity
1692,7067-76047-0037.flac,that i think is what i think is wha i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you in her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on
1693,7067-76047-0023.flac,well she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions that is how how i inferred that there was no mother i don't think there has been any stepmother
1694,7067-76047-0022.flac,now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond you know that she has told me as much
1695,7067-76047-0040.flac,seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity see miss grammont has an sexan s an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoilt child with no discipline
1696,7067-76047-0009.flac,she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or hehelpless human being her m her m her manners suggest a person of considerable self control and and and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say
1697,7067-76047-0044.flac,as the phrase goes what is to follow there was  a pause sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with a counsel with them and then decided to take offence
1698,7067-76047-0005.flac,sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice to day miss seyfferd has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was
1699,7067-76047-0016.flac,and honor than they have and honor than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the rever and and us the rever and us the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility
1700,7067-76047-0045.flac,really he said this is preposterous you talk talk of falling in love as though it was t was it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf in our ages our ages our ages in our quality
1701,7067-76047-0013.flac,i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this gested this gested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kenem latter at bornmouth nothing simpler than to go to him now
1702,7067-76047-0008.flac,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeedin almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady o very good social position indeed
1703,7067-76047-0035.flac,and something more than that what it is it is i don't know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed
1704,7067-76047-0021.flac,miss seyffert is a fairly crute ecrude mixture of frankness in sincere frankness in sincerity and self explanatory egotism and i i i i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me
1705,7067-76047-0015.flac,but neither gentlemen wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the the inconveniences your present code would set about it
1706,7067-76047-0039.flac,i see a lot more than that you don't more than that you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i but i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible negligible that is the exact word to them you can't look at a woman for five minutes
1707,7067-76047-0047.flac,is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you too anyhow
1708,7067-76047-0030.flac,probably bored her more than she realized to any one too prortoo intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and pan playing games and pronplaying games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewellery
1709,7067-76047-0001.flac,a broad and original thinker as you are thought is one matter rash inconsiderate action quite another above all if i spend another day in or near the company of he company of miss
1710,7067-76047-0017.flac,but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one and you if you will forgive me are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications
1711,7067-76047-0002.flac,and bit his lower and lower lip and considered we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite
1712,7067-76047-0049.flac,they had smoothed over the over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martineau
1713,7067-76047-0000.flac,after twenty four eventful hours our two students of human motives found found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old georges smoking room they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension
1714,5678-43303-0019.flac,she was not not offended for she trusted her husband too well but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating the old lady too seemed excited she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks and hardly smiled at all to the girl's greeting
1715,5678-43303-0003.flac,she was he was he was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body the old lady was so tranquil and human
1716,5678-43303-0009.flac,she asked no no she may live ten years i said he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxshoxygen injector and went shen injector and went away the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand
1717,5678-43303-0018.flac,he seemed moved at something and mabel mabel mabel looked at him in astonishment it is not eastern news she asked his eyebrows wrinkled a little
1718,5678-43303-0017.flac,he will will he not you have not heard mister brand said he would be here for a late dinner he will reach london at nineteen and is there any other news he compressed his lips there are rumors he said mister brand wired to me an hour ago
1719,5678-43303-0013.flac,back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself those betelf those same notes would be struck again were being struck again even now all over the world though with an an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch
1720,5678-43303-0031.flac,he had often been later than this i n he might have missed the volor he meant to catch the convention might have been prolonged he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire
1721,5678-43303-0036.flac,i am back all as well now listen i well now listen well now listen can you hear yes yes the best has happened it is iis all over in the east telsenburgh has done it now listen i cannot come home to night it will will will be announced in paul's house in two hours from now
1722,5678-43303-0006.flac,her whole point so her so to speak lay in the delicate little fabric of personality built out of fragile things into an entity far more significant than the sum of her in the sum of its component parts the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion
1723,5678-43303-0004.flac,so absorbed in small external matters so all external matters so all external maters so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth so utterly wit without resentment or peevishness
1724,5678-43303-0010.flac,well my dear dea dea dear she asked it is just a little weakness mother you must lie quiet and do nothing shall i read to you no my dear i i will think a little it was no part of mabel's idea to duty to tell her that she was in danger
1725,5678-43303-0005.flac,she found less difficulty in contemplating and contemplated and contemplating the end of a vigorous soul for in that case she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things
1726,5678-43303-0011.flac,for there was no past to set straight no judge to be confronted death was an ending not a beginning it was a peaceful gospel at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come
1727,5678-43303-0023.flac,and he had giveen her no news of the paris convention he only repeated that mister oliver would be back that night then he had gone off in a hurry half an hour later the old lady seemed asleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her
1728,5678-43303-0038.flac,yes quick mother is ill shall i leave beef beev her how ill oh no immediate danger the doctor has seen her there was silence for a moment yes come then we will go back to night anyhow then
1729,5678-43303-0034.flac,oliver hated interference and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety then even as she turned away the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight whitehall she pressed the corresponding button and her hand shaking so much
1730,5678-43303-0025.flac,as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would that the convention would that the convention would close that afternoon twenty o'clock came but there was no there was no there was no sign of oliver the paris volor should have arrived an hour before
1731,5678-43303-0026.flac,but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one
1732,5678-43303-0030.flac,i daresay he may be kept in paris the old face on the packa pillow nodded and murmured and mabel went down again it was now an hour after dinner time oh there were a hundred things that might have kept him
1733,5678-43303-0015.flac,mister phillips arrived the next morning morning morning as usual just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her she is a is a little better i think said mabel she must be very quiet all day ey y ay the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room
1734,5678-43303-0028.flac,turning again and again to the window listening to the soft rush of the tte trains the faint hoots from the track and the musical chords from the junction a mile away the lights were up by now and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairylad between the earthly light
1735,5678-43303-0007.flac,the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace it is syncope said the doctor when he came in she may die at any time she may live ten years there is no need to telegraph for mister brand
1736,5678-43303-0029.flac,and the heavenly darkness why did not oliver come or at least let her know why he did not once she went upstairs miserably anxious herself to reassure the old lady and found the old lady and found her again very drowsy he is not come she said
1737,5678-43303-0037.flac,we are communicating with the press come up here to meet me at once you must be present can you hear oh yes come then at once it will be the greatest thing in history tell no one come before the rush begins in half an hour the way will be stopped oliver
1738,5678-43303-0021.flac,he will be back to dinner will he not if the volor is not not not late now mother are you ready for breakfast mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation it was certain that something had happened
1739,5678-43303-0022.flac,the secretary who breakfasted with her in the the parlour looking on to the garden had appeared strangely excited he had told her ththu told her thu told her that he would be away the rest of the day mister oliver had given e given him his instructions he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question
1740,5678-43303-0014.flac,but that particular emotion was gone it was foolish to think that it foolish to think that it foolish to think that it was sounding eternally ele else ele elsewhere for there was no elsewhere she too herself would cease one day let her see to it that that  that th that the tone was pure and lovely
1741,5678-43303-0012.flac,so the girl went downstairs once more there's once more with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still what a what a what a strange and beautiful thing death was she told herself this resolution of a cord that had hung suspended for had hung suspended for thirty fifty or seventy years
1742,5678-43303-0002.flac,and mabel running upstairs in alarm and in alarm an alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair it is nothing my dear said the old lady tremulously and she added the description of a symptom or two
1743,5678-43303-0027.flac,of course she might have missed it there there there was no depending on its exact course but she had seen it a hundred times before and wondered unreasonably why she had not seen it now but she would not but she would not sit down to dinner and paced up and down in her white dress
1744,5678-43303-0000.flac,mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch and for a few days did her best but there was nothing that alarmed her the old lady was a little quiet perhaps but went about her minute affairs as usual she asked the girl to read to her sometimes
1745,5678-43303-0032.flac,he might even have wired to mister phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it there it was that round silent month that little row of labelled buttons
1746,5678-43303-0001.flac,she packed his bag with h bag with her bag with her own hands set out his furs for the swift flight to paris and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction he would be gone three days he said it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill
1747,5678-43303-0024.flac,neither did she like to leave the house so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing till the long shadow lay across the path and the tumbled platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west
1748,5678-43303-0033.flac,she half decided to touch them one by one and by one and by one and inquire whether anything had been heard of her husband there was his club his office in whitehall mister phillip's house parliament house and the rest but she hesitated telling herself to be patient
1749,5678-43303-0020.flac,said mabel old missus brand looked at her sharply at her sharply at her sharply an instant but said nothing don't excite et set et yourself mother oliver will be back to night the old lady drew a long breath don't trouble about me my dear she said i shall do very well now
1750,5678-43303-0035.flac,that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear she listened who is there her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice tiny and minute across the miles of wire i mabel she said alone here
1751,5678-43303-0008.flac,he made a little deprecating movement with his hands it is not certain that she will die it
1752,5678-43303-0016.flac,where a heap of letters lay where a heap of letters lay where a heap of letters lay to be answered a couple of hours later as mabel went upstair upstair upstairs once more she met mister phillips coming down he looked a little flushed under his sallow skin missus brand sent for me he said she wished to know whether mister oliver would be back to night
1753,5678-43302-0024.flac,but she could see what she could see what she could see what she loved to see that response to her own heart and so they sat in silence while of of of a sky darkened yet more and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs
1754,5678-43302-0019.flac,but after this well after this well bu after this well well we have shown that we can shed our blood too it is in n inhe nick of time too just at the crisis i don't want to exaggerate it is only a but exaggerate it is only a exaggerate it is only a scratch but it was so deliberate and
1755,5678-43302-0031.flac,tell me some more there is no more but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis if the the the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now it will never be likely to raise it again it will mean free trade all over the world i suppose
1756,5678-43302-0033.flac,these new benninsheine explosives will make certain certain certain of that but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them absolutely benninschein sold sold sold them simultaneously to east and west then he died luckily for him mabel had heard this kind of talk before
1757,5678-43302-0027.flac,no my dear you're excited and to not tot tired it's just a little sentiment oliver i i i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her but she hears it everywhere now no she doesn't remember
1758,5678-43302-0037.flac,half as much again as the rest of the world half world world put together and the conclusion to be drawn from these premises was not reassuring to england hat hat but imagination simply refused to speak the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day
1759,5678-43302-0035.flac,now if tales were true entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell the new conditions were unimaginable military experts prophesied extravagantly contradicting contradicting contradicting one another on vital points
1760,5678-43302-0018.flac,my dear i feel very downcast sometimes as you know well i do not think i shall be again i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit and that the old tories were partly right when they prophesied what communism would do
1761,5678-43302-0025.flac,oliver stirred presently did you know did you notice anything just now sweetheart when i said that about jesus christ she stopped knitting for a moment said the girl he nodded you saw that too then
1762,5678-43302-0028.flac,she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years well whatch her won't you by the way yes there's a little more news from the east  from the east they say felsenburgh's running the whole thing now the empire is sending him everywhere
1763,5678-43302-0029.flac,tobolsk benares yakutsk everyeverywhere and he's been to australia mabel sat up briskly isn't that very hopeful i suppose so there's no doubt that the sufies are winning but for how long is another question
1764,5678-43302-0036.flac,the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory there were the theory there were theory there were no precedents with which to compare it it to compare it it to compare it it was as if archers disputed as to the results of kordyte only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine and as regards male population
1765,5678-43302-0022.flac,if they would not not be such heavy fools they don't understand they don't understand yes oliver they soliver they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is humanity life truth at last and the death of folly but haven't i told them a hundred times
1766,5678-43302-0030.flac,besides the troops don't disperse and europe europe is arming as fast as possible i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris i must go your arm my dear my arm must get well it will have to go with me anyhow
1767,5678-43302-0021.flac,if only this infernal eastern affair would end if he knew he was feverish and irritable and made a great effort to drive it down oh my dear he went on flushed a little
1768,5678-43302-0016.flac,of course not my my my darling what is it what do you think will be the effect he raised himself a little looking out as usual through the darkening windows on to that astonishing view
1769,5678-43302-0020.flac,and so dramatic the poor devil could not have devil could not have chosen a worse moment people won't forget it mabel's eyes shone with pleasure you poor dear she said are you in pain not ain not much besides christ
1770,5678-43302-0023.flac,she loved to see him like this his confident flushed face confident flushed face the enthusiasm in his blue eye sheyes and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with papassion she bent forward and kissed him suddenly my dear i am so proud of you oh oliver he said nothing
1771,5678-43302-0034.flac,but her imagination simply refbut but ffused to grasp it a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing there had been no european war within living memory an the eastern wars but hereastern wars but eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions
1772,5678-43302-0017.flac,everywhere now lights were glowing a sea of mellow moons just above the houses and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening the effect he said it can be nothing but good it was time that something happened
1773,5678-43302-0038.flac,founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world  felt felsenburg's name appeared more frequently than ever otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush nothing suffered very much trade went on
1774,5678-43302-0039.flac,european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual usual men still built houses married wives begat sons and daughters did their busi business and went to the theatre for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else they could neither save nor precipitate the situation
1775,5678-43302-0026.flac,mabel do you think she is falling back oh she is is getting old said the girl lightly of course she looks back a little but you don't think it would be too awful she shook her head no
1776,5678-43302-0040.flac,it was on too large a scale occasionally people went mad people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness but that was all
1777,5678-43302-0032.flac,and all that kind of thing but if not well if not there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined
1778,5678-43302-0000.flac,oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home leaning back in his chair with one arm bandaged and in a sling they had not been able to get near him at the time the excitement in the square had been too fierce
1779,5678-43302-0005.flac,she said then she broke off she broke off and sat back why did he shoot just then she asked oliver turned his eyes for for an instant towards instant towards his mother but she was knitting tranquilly then he answered with a curious deliberateness
1780,5678-43302-0012.flac,the huge electric placards over london had winked out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight oliver brand wounded catholic assailant indignation of the country
1781,5678-43302-0014.flac,he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and hands had clutched and torn at his throat then the face had had vanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared oh
1782,5678-43302-0008.flac,nothing more he was well dressed though oliver leaned back a little wearily and closed hi and closed his and closed his eyes his arm still throbbed intolerably but he was very happy at heart it woul be at heart it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic
1783,5678-43302-0006.flac,i said that brathwate had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together he was ether he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second then they went on again as before
1784,5678-43302-0004.flac,mabel leaned forward oliver i know this sound stupid of me but but i wish they had not killed him oliver smiled at her he knew this tender trait in her it would have been more perfect if they had not
1785,5678-43302-0010.flac,caldecott the prime minister maxwell snowford and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations and from every part of england streamed in message after message it was an immense stroke for the communists
1786,5678-43302-0015.flac,there was some passion and loyalty left in england his mother their mother their mother got up presently and went out still without a word and mabel turne they turned turned to him him laying a hand on his knee are you too tired to talk my dear he opened his eyes
1787,5678-43302-0007.flac,but he must have meant to to to to do it anyhow continued oliver how do they know he was they know he was a catholic asked the girl again there was a rosary on him and then he just had time to call on on on his god and nothing more is known
1788,5678-43302-0002.flac,well there was no chance for a priest this time mabel nodded slowly she had read of the man's fate on the placards he was killed trampled and strangled instantly said oliver i did what i could you saw me
1789,5678-43302-0011.flac,speaking in defence of his principles it was an incalculable gain for them and loss for the individualists that confessors were not all on one side after all
1790,5678-43302-0001.flac,but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors he was a catholic explained the drawn faced oliver he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded

1910,5561-41615-0026.flac,if you have that paper in your possession bring it to me at once and never answer me again as you did just now you are both disrespectful disrespectful and impertinent but miss thompson's anger toward eleanor was was was was nothing compared with the tempest that the principal had aroused in eleanor
1911,5561-41615-0027.flac,the latter flushed then turned perfectly white with rage still standing she reached down
1912,5561-41615-0030.flac,i will not tolerate such behavior eleanor glared at the principal whose face was rigid in its purpose then sank into the nearest vacant seat saying defiantly you may keep me here all night if you like
1913,5561-41615-0018.flac,the standard of the school will be lowered therefore i intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous influence prompted this act of insubordination report says that this movement originated in the junior class
1914,5561-41615-0045.flac,but there was nothing funny about it now when with but with the but with the exception of eleanor the principal dismissed them they followed de corcorously out very uneasy in mind miss thompson had taken their names but had not stated their punishment and oh was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure
1915,5561-41615-0003.flac,at recess there was more more more more grouping and whispering and grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year
1916,5561-41615-0031.flac,nevertheless she did not again attempt to leave the room she room she had met with a will stronger than her own and she realized it ignoring eleanor's final remark miss thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand
1917,5561-41615-0014.flac,that i find hard to credit but before you leave here this afternoon i must know who is innocent and who is guilty miss thompson paused and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats while a few glanced quickly toward eleanor who was looking straight ahead the picture of innocence
1918,5561-41615-0000.flac,chapter fifteen a would be lark
1919,5561-41615-0034.flac,grace was thoroughly angry with her she could not forgive eleanor for having accused her and her friends of carrying tales before almost the entire school therefore a forced apology would not appeace her wounded pride
1920,5561-41615-0017.flac,such a decision is worse than disobedience it is lawlessness
1921,5561-41615-0044.flac,and the terror of suspension arose in more than on one mind as they listened to her scathing remarks
1922,5561-41615-0043.flac,good bye grace chorused her friends and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of tefate of the fate of the would be truants to return to those youthful transgressors they were spending a most uncomfortable half a ga fa four with miss thompson she was merciless in her denunciation of their conduct
1923,5561-41615-0025.flac,because it has spoiled all our fun there was a gasp of horror at eleanor's assertion no one had ever before spoken so disrespectfully to their revered principal miss savell said the principal quietly although her flashing eyes and set lips showed that she was very angry
1924,5561-41615-0009.flac,i can't bear to have secrets and not tell you
1925,5561-41615-0036.flac,the girls silently donned their wraps and fled from the building like fugitives from justice once on the street a lively confab ensued all talking at once let's once let's once let's take turns talking cried grace laughing we shall understand she'll understand each other a little better
1926,5561-41615-0008.flac,and did you sign it asked jessica i certainly did not responded mabel it was she stopped then flushed
1927,5561-41615-0024.flac,i wrote it miss thompson she said clearly i wrote it because i wished to
1928,5561-41615-0015.flac,that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus matinee or any public performance of this nature i have so severely disciplined pupils for this offence that for a long time no one has disobeyed me
1929,5561-41615-0035.flac,she she drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door hurry up she said we'll talk when we get outside school don't stop for a minute if miss thompson notices that we're gone she'll send after us
1930,5561-41615-0004.flac,eleanor started that paper started that paper whatever it is said nora omalley of the pisigma tau who stood in a group around her desk she was here when i i i came in this morning and i was early too
1931,5561-41615-0022.flac,her example was followed until two thirds of the girls present were standing the principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly discomfiting that will do she said curtly
1932,5561-41615-0005.flac,here comes mabel said jessica maybe she has seen the paper
1933,5561-41615-0041.flac,no said grace grace shortly she deserves to be punished the things she said to miss thompson were disgraceful and i shall never forgive her for or forgive her for or forgive her for the way she spoke of us i wouldn't say that grace remarked anne you can never tell what may happen to change your views
1934,5561-41615-0002.flac,and as the morning advanced they became fully aware that something unusual was in the wind se all times they caught sight of a folded paper being stealthily passed from one desk to another but as to its contents they had no idea as it was not handed to any one of them
1935,5561-41615-0039.flac,it was passed to m by mistake very likely agreed grace i wonder who did tell miss thompson i saw several girls with the paper
1936,5561-41615-0010.flac,we don't want you to tell if it doesn't concern us we don't care do wwe don't care do don't care do we girls no indeed was the reply just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved
1937,5561-41615-0047.flac,do you intend to obey me miss savell asked miss thompson still there was no answer very well continued miss thompson your silence indicates that you are still insubordinate you may therefore choose between two things
1938,5561-41615-0020.flac,grace inwardly congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing none of her friends were implicated either even mabel had refused to sign
1939,5561-41615-0042.flac,it will have to be something remarkable in this instance replied grace grimly as she bade bade bade bade the girls good bye remember girls basketball practice again to morrow and the rest of the week miss thompson has promised me the gymnasium please make it a point to be on hand
1940,5561-41615-0006.flac,mabel nodded what was written on it mabel asked grace curiously mabel asked grace curiously mabel looked distressed for a moment then she said
1941,5561-41615-0038.flac,i suppose it did look as though i told you i told you girls said mabel allison who had joined them at the gate you know i was with you at recess right after the paper had been passed to me
1942,5561-41615-0029.flac,with these words eleanor angrily flung the book she held on the desk we held on the desk and walked down the aisle towards the door but miss thompson barred her way stop miss savell she commanded
1943,5561-41615-0021.flac,what i insist upon knowing now whenow now is who are the real culprits beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it
1944,5561-41615-0048.flac,you may apologize to me now and to morrow to the girls you have accused of treachery
1945,5561-41615-0033.flac,grace motioned the girls to hurry she wished wishe wished to leave the room with her friends before miss thompson noticed them she knew that knew tha knew the principal would insist on an apology from eleanor and neither she nor her friends wished it for the first first first time since eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance
1946,5561-41615-0040.flac,they w'll be weeping and wip be weeping and wip they be weeping and wailing in the skull and cross bones crowd exclaimed nora they are all in this mix up and if they aren't suspended they'll be lucky
1947,5561-41615-0046.flac,when the last girl had disappeared the principal turned to eleanor
1948,5561-41615-0012.flac,dismissed the senio senirsenior class and requested the three lower classes to remain in their seats after the in their seats after the dis their seats after the seniors had quietly left the study hall miss thompson stood gravely regarding the rows of girls girls before her her eyes wandered toward where eleanor sat looking bored and indifferent
1949,5561-41615-0007.flac,but i gave my my word of honor before i read it that i wouldn't mention the contents to any one then of course we won't but of course we won't ask you said anne pearson quickly but tell us this much is it about any of us no replied mabel it isn't it is something i was asked to sign
1950,5561-41615-0001.flac,the majority however appeared to be highly delighted over what they delighted over what they heard one group standing near one of the windows of which eleanor was the centre laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats
1951,5561-41615-0037.flac,she has certainly shown her true colors this time i never heard of any shanyshould anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her old plan said marian barber it was abominable abominable said eva allen the other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms
1952,5561-41615-0013.flac,and then she looked towards grace who looked towards grace who looked towards grace whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention i don't believe believe grace is guilty at any rate thought miss thompson then she addressed the assembled girls something has come to my ears girls said the principal
1953,5561-41615-0032.flac,those girls who are not in any ay anythanyway implicated in this matter are dismissed she said about one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall the pie sigma tau being among the number
1954,5561-41615-0011.flac,on wednesday aside from a little more whispering and an nsignificant glances exchanged among the pupils not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall it was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when miss thompson walked into the room
1955,5561-41615-0023.flac,after they had aft they had stood for what seemed to them in age but was really only a couple of minutes you may be seated the girl who composed girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and eaften explain herself without hesitating eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an insolent smile
1956,5456-62043-0015.flac,how does that wood burn inquired the captain of the mate who was looking on looking on looking on at the game tisn't of much account i reckon answered the mate mate mate it's cottonwood and most of it's grip green at that well thompson three aces again stranger
1957,5456-62043-0007.flac,and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized wood pile hallo colonel how d'ye sal your wood this time a yellow faced old gentleman
1958,5456-62043-0003.flac,she must have had a time of it it was my fate to take passage to take passage in this boat the captain captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag we had been out a little more than five days
1959,5456-62043-0012.flac,and there's no other woodyard for nine miles ahead and nine miles ahead an nine miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fuel why well well interrupted the captain we'll take a few cords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of brag
1960,5456-62043-0031.flac,the pilot with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game and said in an unthundthundertone forty apiece for you and i and james james james the other pilot is not bad for one night i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs
1961,5456-62043-0022.flac,or if they did or if they did or if they did venture to call out on two bullets and a bragger they had the mortification to find one of one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable still with all these disadvantages they continued playing
1962,5456-62043-0009.flac,and a pipe in his mouth casting a glant a glna glana glance at the empti guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he roped he rose from fastening our spring line answered why captain we must charge you three and a quarter this time the devil replied the captain
1963,5456-62043-0011.flac,wood's risk gris riz since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop goin down
1964,5456-62043-0023.flac,they wanted to learn the game at two o'clock the captain asked the mate how we were getting on oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising
1965,5456-62043-0018.flac,i can't very well leave the game now it's getting right warm this pilot's beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard
1966,5456-62043-0024.flac,this wood seems rather better than that we took in yellow faces but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask im what's the price of wood up here i've got you again
1967,5456-62043-0026.flac,the strangers suffering some at the same the same time three and a quarter again are we never to get to a cheaper country deal sir if you please better luk the next time the other pilot's voice was again heard on deck how much have you only about ten cords sir
1968,5456-62043-0020.flac,the latter personages took it turned and turn about steering and playing brag one of them almost invariably winning while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their anties they were anxious to learn the game
1969,5456-62043-0030.flac,it appears the two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost one hundred and twenty dollars the captain as he rose to see about taking in some goodwood which he felt sure of oobobtaining now that he had got above the level country winked at his opponent
1970,5456-62043-0027.flac,was the reply of the youthful salesman the captain here told thompson was was hopsened to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game the pilots here changed places when did they sleep wood taken in
1971,5456-62043-0013.flac,in about half an hour we half an hour we felt the caravan commenced paddling again supper was over

1974,5456-62043-0037.flac,accompanied by the same leer of the same yellow countenance why darnit adarn it all captain there is but three or four cords left and since it's you i don't care if i do let you have it for three as you're a good customer
1975,5456-62043-0001.flac,she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera her regular trips from new orleans to natches wee usually made and from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable
1976,5456-62043-0005.flac,sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck

1978,5456-62043-0014.flac,situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate
1979,5456-62043-0036.flac,out crept from the cottage the veritable faded hat copperas cuccutcolored pants yellow countenance and two weeks beard we had seen the night before
1980,5456-62043-0034.flac,i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petticoat
1981,5456-62043-0038.flac,and turned in to take some rest the fact became apparent the reader will probably have discovered it some time since
1982,5456-62043-0021.flac,and they did learn it once in a while indeed seeing they had they had they had two aces and a bragger they would venture a bed of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot
1983,5456-62043-0008.flac,with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders shoulders holding up to his arm pits a pair of coppers coloured coppers colored linsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black
1984,5456-62043-0006.flac,which he he he said was situated right round yonder point but muttered the captain i don't much like to take to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there's no other chance
1985,5456-62043-0010.flac,what's the odd quarter fore i should like to know you only charged me three as i went down why captang drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of alleer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold
1986,5456-62043-0033.flac,and the captain haled hallo the wood yard hallo yourself answered a squeaking female voice an female voice and female voice which came from a woman with a petticoat over her shoulders in place of a shawl what's the price of wood
1987,5456-62043-0035.flac,and now you know it three and the devil broke in in inand in the captain what have you raised on your wood too i'll give you three and not a cent more well replied the petticoat here comes the old man they'll talk to you and sure enough
1988,5456-62043-0029.flac,the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning
1989,5456-62043-0028.flac,the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned the brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation
1990,5456-62043-0032.flac,there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taking in more than sixty yards so i was disappointed in my expectation we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood the banks being invisible from the middle of the river there it is exclaimed the captain stop her
1991,5456-62043-0017.flac,the game went on and the paddles kept the paddles kept the paddles kept moving at eleven o'clock it was reported to the capan cap captain that we were nearing the woodyard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty pilot on duty head her in shore then and take in six cords if it's good see to it thompson

1993,5456-62043-0025.flac,i heard the bell and the pilot's hail what's your prizes for wood a youthful voice on the shore shore shore answered three and a quarter damn it ejaculated the captain

2048,5456-24741-0014.flac,which associations arises in the mind withmind according to the order and association of the modifications affectns of the human body i say first it is an association of those ideas only

2282,5390-30096-0033.flac,it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years
2283,5390-30096-0004.flac,and it's the the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of but i'm so glad cried patsy clapping her hands with a delighted gesture it's a splendid way to do good
2284,5390-30096-0000.flac,chapter one uncle john's cle john's farm how did i happen did i happen to own a farm asked uncle john interrupting his soup long enough enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major doyle who sat opposite
2285,5390-30096-0022.flac,he was in a bad fix another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off it would take a lot of money to fight back three thousand at least
2286,5390-30096-0021.flac,he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money quite right returned uncle john nodding but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale
2287,5390-30096-0002.flac,do you do that exclaimed miss patricia doyle d'do doyle who sat between her uncle and father and kept i and kept an active eye upon both bo de both so the major says answered uncle john drily and it's true
2288,5390-30096-0006.flac,and how can i tell whether who can i tell whetherwho can i tell whether they're deserving or not retorted may major doyle fiercely do ye want me to become a sluth or engage detectives to track the the objects of your erroneous philanthropy
2289,5390-30096-0032.flac,you talk as if it were a real farm instead youd you'd a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift uncle john looked sober again any one live on you can any one live on the place major he inquired

2291,5390-30096-0008.flac,but some of them must succeed ventured patsy in a conciliatory tone some do said john merrick and that repays me for all my trouble
2292,5390-30096-0023.flac,but he was decent about it after all his father had left him a little farm at millville he couldn't say what it was worth but there were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as security
2293,5390-30096-0012.flac,that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up then u then up until he discovered it by an accident than he promptly retired to give other fellows a chance and he now that that ow now devoted his life to simple acts of charity
2294,5390-30096-0017.flac,patricia was the apple of uncle john's john's eye and the one goddess enshrined in her doting father's heart glancing at her
2295,5390-30096-0031.flac,and we we we can take mery along to do the cooking suggested patsy entering into the idea enthusiastically and eat in o deat in o deat in our shirt sleeves said uncle john with a the glowing face and have a cow an some pigs cried the girl
2296,5390-30096-0007.flac,i just have to form a judgment and take me chances and when a poor devil goes wrong
2297,5390-30096-0016.flac,while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and what why and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of when a man when a man of his wealth as it was admirable he had never married
2298,5390-30096-0001.flac,replied the major composedly it's a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you won't look after yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and ambitious young men who want a start in life oh uncle
2299,5390-30096-0010.flac,with one thing and another what of it wwith at of it what of it retorted the little round und faced millionaire leaning back in his chair and staring fixedly at the other that's what i implore you for now now gentlemen cried patsy earnestly
2300,5390-30096-0027.flac,have you investigated the investigated the farm at all i looked up a real estate dealer living at mill millville and wrote him about the wegg farm he said if any one wanted the place very badly it might sell for three thousand dollars humph
2301,5390-30096-0024.flac,if you would let him have three thousand more if three thousand more so you took the farm and gave him the money i did sir perif you did sir perhaps i am to blame
2302,5390-30096-0028.flac,but his best information was to the effectfcfect that no one wanted it at all patsy laughed poor uncle john she said the little man however was serious
2303,5390-30096-0011.flac,of his falling down and worshipping him john merrick was of multi millionaire to be sure but there were pelliating circumstances that almost excused him he had been so busily occupied in industry
2304,5390-30096-0003.flac,asserted the other he's the other he's assisted three or four score young men to start in business in the last year to my certain a certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars
2305,5390-30096-0005.flac,without capital you know many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder and many will never get it there in any event declared the major with a shake of his grizzled head
2306,5390-30096-0009.flac,queried the major you mean al nor my trouble well and your money
2307,5390-30096-0020.flac,and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face she was nearly seventeen years old not very tall and her form to speak charitably
2308,5390-30096-0030.flac,beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farm's the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and we'll all have a glorious lazy time
2309,4853-29413-0022.flac,she she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me made me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen
2310,4853-29413-0024.flac,how did you know that he would not drink the the the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them
2311,4853-29413-0019.flac,it was borne in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe you did believe you did believe me you might have sent for the police
2312,4853-29413-0026.flac,i should say no judging by his looks he turned his looks he turned his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a once in a once in a way he was honest honestly frightened honest honestly frightened thonest honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor
2313,4853-29413-0018.flac,that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any live they live they live they living creature what tha  th he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safe thatthat my safe tat my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain
2314,4853-29413-0027.flac,a man who can change his complexion at will is a maction at will is a maction at will is a man we haven't heard of yet mister roylake i had been dressing for some time past longing to see cristel it is needless to say
2315,4853-29413-0021.flac,that she was true as steel and not easily frightened that i didn't need hany need to guess i knew it gloody had done his best to best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded
2316,4853-29413-0017.flac,a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soo so soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time
2317,4853-29413-0023.flac,whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea yes well that was one of the signals agreed on between us
2318,4853-29413-0029.flac,well the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief cottage he means mischief and his eye is on mis cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars
2319,4853-29413-0025.flac,i ought i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i the i went on and your accident the next room was planned of course i said
2320,4853-29413-0030.flac,i i wi was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars
2321,4853-29413-0028.flac,is there anything more i asked i asked i asked that i ought to know only one thing mister roylake that i can think of gloodyreplied i'm afraid it's miss cristel's afraid it's miss cristel's turned next what do you mean
2322,4853-29413-0031.flac,had we any proof to justify us gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boat house no oars no oars
2323,4853-29413-0032.flac,and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell hm me nothing sir
2324,4853-29413-0020.flac,the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be he was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of you i don't i don't i don't mean any offence sir i pretty well guessed
2325,4853-29413-0003.flac,the delay of dressing was more than a than than i than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me me gloody showed himself at the door
2326,4853-29413-0014.flac,to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the curto which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without warn me without warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed
2327,4853-29413-0015.flac,but his resolution to do me good sir us in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned
2328,4853-29413-0009.flac,what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause
2329,4853-29413-0007.flac,even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mister roylake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if if i hadn't had something else to tell you only i don't know how
2330,4853-29413-0005.flac,i'm dismissed from my my my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked
2331,4853-29413-0008.flac,in this this this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i here sir what ikhere sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us to is settled now on both sides
2332,4853-29413-0013.flac,the cur had betrayed himself it was a gelf it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasure the pleasure the pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested
2333,4853-29413-0000.flac,gloody settles the account a night of f ef fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened
2334,4853-29413-0011.flac,the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll lanswer them to the best of my ability
2335,4853-29413-0004.flac,with a face ominously wretched as with face ominously wretched as with face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting witha withaitg waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir
2336,4853-29413-0012.flac,the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming
2337,4853-29413-0010.flac,we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little
2338,4853-29413-0016.flac,gloody was employed i employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the objeectwas the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party
2339,4853-29413-0006.flac,what did he do flew into a furious rage rage i don't complain of i don't complain of i don't complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window
2340,4853-29413-0001.flac,the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell
2341,4853-29413-0002.flac,the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flock flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom
2342,4853-27670-0015.flac,her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand
2343,4853-27670-0028.flac,for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other year against which leaned a portion of the the the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away
2344,4853-27670-0000.flac,i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvellous
2345,4853-27670-0035.flac,i had noticed the jolly boat jolly boat jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make up ic out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing
2346,4853-27670-0023.flac,but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast ballast ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea
2347,4853-27670-0030.flac,no language that i have command of could put before you  the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea
2348,4853-27670-0036.flac,and even had i managed this managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned
2349,4853-27670-0024.flac,i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some steady myself during some steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull
2350,4853-27670-0019.flac,i swalllowed half a pannikin of the hollands for the sake of the warmth and life of the draught and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them
2351,4853-27670-0025.flac,until coming in a breast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body and a man's body nd a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosy b captain rosy b captain rosy there was a wound over his right brow
2352,4853-27670-0026.flac,and as if that and and hhad not sufficed to slay him the fall of the masts had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round and oun ount and ound his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly
2353,4853-27670-0027.flac,that no executioner could have gone more tha on more artistically to work topinion and choke a man under a mass of rigging that rigging that rigging in the larboard scuppers lay two bodies as i could just faintly discern
2354,4853-27670-0034.flac,to judge by the sound of the quantity of w of weof water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easimight easily have kept her free
2355,4853-27670-0005.flac,the brig pitched and rolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that self the self that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in
2356,4853-27670-0014.flac,reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort resome slender comfort some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was reheavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality the buoyancy of vitality the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas and that after all
2357,4853-27670-0029.flac,i crossed to the starboard side side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seaman ta seaman named abraham wise near the fore hatch
2358,4853-27670-0016.flac,by preventing the seas which washed on to the forecast bforecast borecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that but that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side
2359,4853-27670-0021.flac,i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm cased in a warm cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log
2360,4853-27670-0004.flac,there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley
2361,4853-27670-0018.flac,i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew
2362,4853-27670-0013.flac,misery and horror were within e and horror were within that shadow and beyond it nothing that my spirit could or it could look up to i stood for some moments as one stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea
2363,4853-27670-0011.flac,but no feature of my lamentable situation so affrighted me so worked upon and and the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for one companion
2364,4853-27670-0031.flac,but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been beset running by the long fierce gale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses
2365,4853-27670-0002.flac,my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armour so inflexibly hard were they frozen yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins
2366,4853-27670-0010.flac,it was was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i  i i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the the the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round
2367,4853-27670-0012.flac,even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech nay god himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not yet the blackness lay like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul
2368,4853-27670-0020.flac,and i then then with a seaman's dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot and cannt and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days
2369,4853-27670-0003.flac,it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest color upon the hatchway one thing i quickly noticed that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze
2370,4853-27670-0017.flac,my eye directly sought it and found the time twenty minutes after ten this signified that i had ten or eleven hours of darkness before me
2371,4853-27670-0009.flac,my loneliness was more terrible to  to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness
2372,4853-27670-0006.flac,it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out
2373,4853-27670-0032.flac,i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside weighty enough you would have supposed to stave the ship
2374,4853-27670-0008.flac,what has come to pass is it possible that whut whut what all my companions have been washed overboard certainly five men at least were living before we fouled the ice and again i cried out is there anyone alive
2375,4853-27670-0033.flac,nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless
2376,4853-27670-0022.flac,nevertheless  nevertheless its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth
2377,4853-27670-0007.flac,finding that i had the use of my voice i hello as loudly as i could but no human note responded three or four times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought
2378,4853-27670-0001.flac,i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they they they been of stone
2379,4853-27671-0017.flac,shot with pearly lustre floated overhead very high it hvery high it was in truth a fair and a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the air being dry its its its shrewdness was endurable
2380,4853-27671-0011.flac,eight or ten biscuits some some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flour and thirteen bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat
2381,4853-27671-0006.flac,and there lay the lolongboat crushed into staves the signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates
2382,4853-27671-0008.flac,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water
2383,4853-27671-0024.flac,so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustaiined by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great
2384,4853-27671-0027.flac,the boat was about fifteen feet long
2385,4853-27671-0016.flac,till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover
2386,4853-27671-0039.flac,it was as silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature
2387,4853-27671-0013.flac,it seemed as though another tumut of water would sink her and if the swell fell over her bougs and filled the decks down she would down she would go i had a small i had a small i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money
2388,4853-27671-0032.flac,i am persuaded my heart and persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly as the grief faintly as te grief faintly as the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck
2389,4853-27671-0001.flac,i had at but but one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float brig would float brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise
2390,4853-27671-0030.flac,i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked i i being picked up and that though by though by though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts
2391,4853-27671-0020.flac,into those prodigious inleagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hull floated she was something to hold in hold hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon
2392,4853-27671-0031.flac,than by sailing into the the the great desolation of the north west the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering
2393,4853-27671-0040.flac,it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon he and splitting upon her and splitting upon a rope flapped its wings and after a turn or two
2394,4853-27671-0005.flac,had floated the jolly boat out of the longboat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell
2395,4853-27671-0035.flac,lifting my eyes with involuntary sympathy in the lift linvoluntary sympathy in the involuntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor lift le sailor li sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies
2396,4853-27671-0034.flac,but one living thing there was besides myself a grey breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hull went down and then
2397,4853-27671-0010.flac,i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham
2398,4853-27671-0036.flac,it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of st ofst of all the fouls of its dominions and poised on tremorless wings
2399,4853-27671-0007.flac,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat and o oat out over i then with a handspike prized her nook and nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
2400,4853-27671-0037.flac,was suwas surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise
2401,4853-27671-0026.flac,and hauling the sheet aft put the oar over the stern and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course the draught of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside
2402,4853-27671-0018.flac,with us had it do wid on yesterday instead of to day my companions would have wi wive been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last
2403,4853-27671-0002.flac,and a deep of rolling sapphire i sied and started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail
2404,4853-27671-0009.flac,but i met with with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past aaast my next business was to victual her
2405,4853-27671-0014.flac,when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her adrift the sun was an hour above the horizon
2406,4853-27671-0023.flac,it was the sailor that that that had lain drown on the starboard side of the forward deck being heck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended
2407,4853-27671-0028.flac,ere i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer north west at a steer north west and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea
2408,4853-27671-0012.flac,the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to that to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came the the brimming an broad liquid blue brows to her stem
2409,4853-27671-0015.flac,heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulder of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendor along
2410,4853-27671-0021.flac,and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her bulwarks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under
2411,4853-27671-0025.flac,and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apapparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling ofof my reason i rose from the seat on to which i had sunk and loose the sale
2412,4853-27671-0019.flac,i threw the i threw the oar over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her
2413,4853-27671-0033.flac,and then all was bare bald swelling sea and empearled sky darkening in lagoons of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapour lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon
2414,4853-27671-0003.flac,yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow
2415,4853-27671-0029.flac,wear perchance i might wear wear perchance i might wear perchance i might meet a whaler or a south seaman from new holland but my heart sank at the the wear the prospect of the leagues of water were which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard indeed
2416,4853-27671-0004.flac,one extraordinary stroke i quicquickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long bostowed in the long bstowed in the longboat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks
2417,4853-27671-0022.flac,and which she dragged down with her and at her on a sudden when the last fragment of mast had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were fflattening to the level surface of the sea up rose a body with a sort of leap
2418,4853-27671-0038.flac,the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after awhile and followed followed me its ede eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies
2419,4853-27671-0000.flac,there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable pall overhead into blueness the hull lay very deep
2420,4830-25904-0021.flac,one one one little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate is his his dinner in a quiet proper mannerr which was an example to the rest the lions ate in dignified silence
2421,4830-25904-0040.flac,and then nodded hi hi his his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fiery eyed head in the middle he was not one of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits
2422,4830-25904-0048.flac,its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command
2423,4830-25904-0017.flac,for they tumbled one over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders
2424,4830-25904-0036.flac,out i said to myself think of a story i read once of a person in a monagerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding toward him
2425,4830-25904-0028.flac,nut shells and straw down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail i'm afraid the gray one bit it off
2426,4830-25904-0041.flac,which i hadn't the with heart to stay and see him devour alive i was walking toward the camel's pagota when all of a sudden a long dark curling tick thck thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face it's the boa i thought
2427,4830-25904-0032.flac,and gave him a bun to comfort him whenwhen i went away the snake house came next and i went in on my way to away to  way to visit the rhinocerous family i rather like snakes
2428,4830-25904-0033.flac,since i had a tame green one who lived under the doorstep and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out and i wasn't allowed to poke them
2429,4830-25904-0050.flac,he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw
2430,4830-25904-0022.flac,all but my favorite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make all our tried to make our tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned her way with a plaintive moan which seemed to grieve him sadly
2431,4830-25904-0023.flac,he wouldn't touch his dinner but lay down near her rrwith the lump between his paws as if guarding it it it it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hungton tunger till his mate could share it with him
2432,4830-25904-0030.flac,bounce on to the straw at first he'd sit and stare abvout him as if much amazed to find himself there then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys
2433,4830-25904-0020.flac,the tigers snarled and fought and tore and and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more
2434,4830-25904-0046.flac,and in an immense wire covered avery all sorts of brilliant bbirds were flying about as gaily as if at home one of the curiosities was a sea cow who lived in a tank of salt water
2435,4830-25904-0035.flac,best when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wondered i hope he hasn't got
2436,4830-25904-0025.flac,as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here was every variety from the great ugly chimpansie to the funny little fellows
2437,4830-25904-0018.flac,one lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of f a tiger's great claw and he clutched it trying to drag hr to drag her to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming
2438,4830-25904-0044.flac,hoping to find something hoto find something to find something eatable i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as hook tree as a tree as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the the ho hog the trees flocks of snow white cranes stalking over the grass
2439,4830-25904-0016.flac,gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic
2440,4830-25904-0042.flac,much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge
2441,4830-25904-0019.flac,as if the whole family of wild beasts were after her
2442,4830-25904-0038.flac,and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainous looking reptile he was and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country
2443,4830-25904-0037.flac,as i as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boa's glittering eyes
2444,4830-25904-0034.flac,and blinked at me through the glass the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakes and big and little snakes black  brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain ones but i liked the great boa
2445,4830-25904-0049.flac,the great polar bear lived next the bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water or sitting on a block of ice panting as if the mile spring day was blazing midsummer
2446,4830-25904-0047.flac,and came at the keeper's call the keeper's call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had four fins instead of two
2447,4830-25904-0039.flac,where such unpleasant neighbours might pop in upon you on you unexpectedly he was kind whe was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he wwish as he stretched himself
2448,4830-25904-0027.flac,he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at everyone like an ill tempered old bachelor half a dozen little ones teased him capily by dropping bits of bread
2449,4830-25904-0026.flac,who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers amamma sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the gray monkey with the blue nose scolded at me
2450,4830-25904-0029.flac,and kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldn't hold him and down he'd go
2451,4830-25904-0031.flac,and finally he'ddfinally he'did finally he'd examine his poor little tail and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the and fallen him the fallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much
2452,4830-25904-0024.flac,as i i took a last look at his fine old face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad douglas douglas tender and true
2453,4830-25904-0045.flac,on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing racing racing in their in their in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes the antelopes chasing one another
2454,4830-25904-0043.flac,i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket
2455,4830-25904-0003.flac,and i was so glad to meet with any one from home that i'd have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me he didn't however
2456,4830-25904-0014.flac,and all to get very ma she excited about something sniffing at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till
2457,4830-25904-0011.flac,some leaping up and down and some washing their faces sping their faces ng their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head
2458,4830-25904-0012.flac,it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and everyone laughed at the sound there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species
2459,4830-25904-0010.flac,i liked this lion very much for though the biggest he was was very gentle and had a noble face the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro
2460,4830-25904-0005.flac,so i threw him some fresh clover and went per and went on to the pelikans i never knew before what handsome birds they were not graceful but with such snowy plumage tinged with pale pink and faint yellow
2461,4830-25904-0000.flac,being alone in london yet wishing to celebrate the day i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoological gardens a lovely place it was and i enjoyed myself immensely for mayday in england is just what it should be
2462,4830-25904-0006.flac,they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills
2463,4830-25904-0001.flac,mild sunny flowery and spring like like like as i walked along the well kept paths between white and rosy hawthorn hedges i kept coming upon new and curious sights
2464,4830-25904-0007.flac,when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it until the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen
2465,4830-25904-0004.flac,and put down anput down his immense head with a sullen snort as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost
2466,4830-25904-0002.flac,for the birds and beasts are so skilfully arranged that it is more like travelling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a managerie the first thing i saw was a great american bicon
2467,4830-25904-0013.flac,i sat walsat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhapp they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens suddenly the small dens suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl
2468,4830-25904-0009.flac,one lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking ing ing very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering
2469,4830-25904-0015.flac,this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line
2470,4830-25904-0008.flac,and there found a splendid sight six lyons lyons and lionesses in s in three or four different cages sitting or sand standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes
2471,4830-25898-0033.flac,and was innocently catching gnats when her mamma came out of the hay mow with a loud cut cut cut
2472,4830-25898-0001.flac,and no sooner were they out out out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as gaily as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their especial benefit it was a fine brood
2473,4830-25898-0046.flac,in the morning few morning few morning few remained and blot felt that she was a forlorn orphan a thought which caused thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours brooding over her sad lot
2474,4830-25898-0043.flac,and were seen by their surviving relatives featherless by their surviving relatives featherless pale and stiff borne away to some unknown known place whence no fowl returned blot was waked one night by a great cackling and fluttering in the hen house
2475,4830-25898-0036.flac,who just then waddled l by oh what can i do screamed the distressed hen nothing ma'am it's fatal and the doctor waddled on to visit dame partlet's son who was ill of the pip my child my child

2477,4830-25898-0021.flac,and hear if i can't do it as well as daddy the chick stopped scratching and scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear strut crow perching himself on the beam he tried his best
2478,4830-25898-0019.flac,so so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmate sat below and watched him
2479,4830-25898-0053.flac,and colder and colder became poor blots in blot's little feet as she  ewated through the drifts the firelight was shining out into the gloom
2480,4830-25898-0044.flac,and peep peep pee peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pulled her off screaming dolefully

2485,4830-25898-0042.flac,they were were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farmyard for turkeys hens ducks and geese fell a prey to it
2486,4830-25898-0009.flac,chickens and all to a gand all to a watery death i'm the most unlucky hand ever hatched groaned
2487,4830-25898-0054.flac,to find all doors shut and no shelter left for no shelter left for her but the bough of a leafless tree too stiff and weak to fly up she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the doorstep
2488,4830-25898-0028.flac,peep found a little hole into the meal room and slipped in full of joy at the sight of the bags boxes and bins i'll eat all i want and then want and then i'll call peck she said

2490,4830-25898-0023.flac,for poor strutt he leaned so far forward in his frantic effort was frantic effort to get a big crow out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor killing himself instantly
2491,4830-25898-0035.flac,there peck stopped suddenly rolled up her eyes and began to stagger about as if she she was tipsy mercy on us what's the matter with the chick cried missus cluck in great alarm fits ma'am answered doctor drake
2492,4830-25898-0013.flac,the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give one one loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs just as legs best as legs and wings could carry her little speckle remembering the advice

2498,4830-25898-0047.flac,and longing to join her family family in some safe and happy land where fowls lived in peace apeace she had her wish very soon for one day when the first snowflakes began to flutter
2499,4830-25898-0031.flac,with her poor little claws sticking straight u u up as if imploring help peck meanwhile got into mischief also
2500,4830-25898-0016.flac,for every fowl in the yard twitted her with the difference between between her preaching and her practice

2502,4830-25898-0014.flac,and unconscious of the he the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away chirping dismally
2503,4830-25898-0049.flac,i liveto live at the red farmhouse over the hill only i don't know which road to take i'll show you come at once for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for too deep for too deep for us said blot so away they went
2504,4830-25898-0011.flac,what a nice time speckled time speckled time speckle did have to be sure for the grasshoppers grasshoppers rasshoppers were lively and fat and aunt was in an unusually amiable mood never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it
2505,4830-25898-0018.flac,till his throat quite ached with the effort ah if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear i should be perfectly happy said this silly little fowl
2506,4830-25898-0002.flac,but poor madame cluck had bad luck with her chicks for they they they were er  wer her first and she didn't know how to manage them old aunt cockletop told her that she didn't and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends
2507,4830-25898-0010.flac,and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with aunt cockletop grasshoppering they called it in the great field across the road
2508,4830-25898-0000.flac,there never was a prouder mamma than madame cluck when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks chicks chicks chanticleer struct snowball speck peep peck downy and blot were their names
2509,4830-25898-0024.flac,for some time after this missus missus cluck kept her three remaining little ones close to her side watching over them with maternal care till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings peep and peck were always together
2510,4830-25898-0052.flac,so good bye dear ohgood bye dear an off trotted blot along the so the  the snowy road hoping to get home before the hen house door door door was shut faster and faster fell the snow darker and darker grew the night
2511,4830-25898-0003.flac,aunt cockletop was right as you will see when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family the tragedy began with chanty who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow
2512,4830-25898-0041.flac,for blot was a great comfort to her never running running running away or disobeying in any way but always close always close always close to her side ready to creep under her wing or bring her a plump bug when the poor biddy's appetite failed her
2513,4830-25898-0027.flac,and can't look after you just no said their mother one day yes ma'am chirp chirped the chickens and then as she went rustling into the haymow they began to run ababout and enjoy themselves with all their might
2514,4830-25898-0038.flac,gasping and rolling up her eyes in great angush for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt and there was no help for her when all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush covered the little grave with chickweed
2515,4830-25898-0012.flac,like a brave chick said the old biddy as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark
2516,4830-25898-0030.flac,sam never saw her but shut damp damp damp down the cover of the bin as he pepassed and left poor peep to die no one knew what had had had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal
2517,4830-25898-0039.flac,and the bereaved parent wore a black string around her leg for a month blot the last of that bright band needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow this was the reason why her mother never

2519,4830-25898-0020.flac,you'll fall and get hurt said his sister blot hold your tongue you ugly tongue you ugly little thing and don't talk to me i'm going to crow and going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen be quiet down there

2521,4830-25898-0050.flac,but it was a long way and dusk came on became on before the red farm house appeared now i'm safe thank you very much won't you come in and stay all night my mother will be glad to see you
2522,4830-25898-0051.flac,said the kit rubbing her soft white face against blots against blots against blot's little black breast
2523,4830-25898-0032.flac,she strayed into the sheep shed and finding some salt ate as much as she liked not knowing that salt is bad for hens having taken all she wanted she ran back to the barn
2524,4830-25898-0045.flac,aunt cockletop pecked and croaked fiercely but touph as she was the old biddy did not escape ape ape ape and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand
2525,4830-25898-0022.flac,came of it and all the chicks laughed that made strut mad and he resolved to crow even if can crow even if crow even if he killed himself doing it he gave an angry cluck flapped his wings and tried again alas alas
2526,4830-25898-0029.flac,and having taken a taste of everything she was about to leave when she heard the stableman coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the meal bin and hid herself

2528,4788-94904-0019.flac,when however the evil stops here the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which though not an invariable are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation
2529,4788-94904-0025.flac,to the acquisition of which representative government is likely is likely to be an impediment the most obvious of these cases is the one already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization that of obedience

2531,4788-94904-0026.flac,a race who have been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body
2532,4788-94904-0022.flac,they would certainly as in spanish america keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war a despotism not even legal but of illegal violence would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers
2533,4788-94904-0023.flac,and the name in forms forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from attaining nining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized

2544,4788-94904-0030.flac,or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified by extreme passiveness
2545,4788-94904-0011.flac,unless therefore the the the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive is always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience
2546,4788-94904-0038.flac,and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation in this manner a central power despotic in principle

2553,4788-94904-0024.flac,there are others in which it possibly might exist but in which some other form of government would be preerable these are principally when the people in order to advance in civilization have advance in civilization have some lesson to learn some habit not yet acquired

2568,4788-91208-0027.flac,by a mistake he fell into the by necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete he acknowledged the force of mister mills's argument that the infinite must include a farago of contradictions
2569,4788-91208-0032.flac,and we join with him in contemning ing ming as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapeas incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange an eternity of personal enjoyment

2572,4788-91208-0018.flac,all reasoning is shown to jown to be at bottom inductive inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic and to induction accordingly mister mill devoted his chief attention all chief attention for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic

2585,4788-91208-0025.flac,in his examination of sir w ww william hamilton's philosophy mister mill gives battle to this this mode of thought after reviewing in an opening chapter the vary various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge
2586,4788-91208-0003.flac,mister mills achievements in both branches of branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society he is
2587,4788-91208-0012.flac,as the only bases of reasoning it is true that outside of the logic of the schools great advances had been made in the rules of scientific investigation but these rules were not only imperfect in themselves but their connection with the law of causation

2595,4788-91208-0004.flac,the structure raised by at at adam smith malthus and ricardo but raised it at least one story higher his inestimable system of logic was a revolution it hardly needs of course to be said that he owed much to his predecessors

2738,4137-11702-0020.flac,said merriwig heartily we shan't have any trouble in that direction again i fancy do tell me did the king of barodia apologize he did better than that he abdicated why
2739,4137-11702-0028.flac,he told her of his secret journey secret journey to the king of barodia's tents he told her of the king of barodia's letter
2740,4137-11702-0039.flac,bhy the way who is he he comes from araby and his name is udo but udo of course why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement my dear it isn't dear it isn't dear it isn't udo i'm afraid father it's coronel
2741,4137-11702-0013.flac,he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down my little hyacinth my own little girl oh father i am glad to have you back there there my child
2742,4137-11702-0025.flac,but she was still engrossed with the whiskers
2743,4137-11702-0056.flac,wait till he has seen them my dear said merriwig with a chuckle he has seen them father what you invited him here
2744,4137-11702-0055.flac,perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor too hyacinth and coronel interchanged a smile alas father she said his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms
2745,4137-11702-0050.flac,and he was telling once more the great story and more the great story of his adventures well well said the king at the end of it when fit when he had received their tribute of admiration those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in wartime he turned to coronel
2746,4137-11702-0044.flac,he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure an adventure after his own heart merrwig was in an awkward position he wondered for for for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room leave us my child
2747,4137-11702-0018.flac,there was another storm of cheers the battle cry of euralia ho ho merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes hyacinth and merriwig went into the palace
2748,4137-11702-0033.flac,it's rather serious but it's rather nice father they're nice father they're nice father dear would you yuyou mind very much if i got married soon my dear you shall shall get married as soon as you like let me see there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day
2749,4137-11702-0016.flac,in honor of our great victory i decree that from that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout euralia terrific cheering
2750,4137-11702-0052.flac,that said coronel simply is much more surprising merriwig however was not merriwig however was not merriwig however was not so sure of that he liked the look of coronel he liked his manner
2751,4137-11702-0043.flac,is it a fact that your majesty majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of barodia's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it
2752,4137-11702-0001.flac,so far as rese pree presis known this was her only work but she built up some repuation on it and belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius to be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men
2753,4137-11702-0048.flac,so you like you like it said merriwig trying to look modest i love it i knew he'd t i knew he'd it i knew he'd love it put in in in hyacinth it's just the sort of story that coronel would love
2754,4137-11701-0004.flac,in case something happens what should happen i don't know but all our life together has been in the forest and i'm just a little afraid of the world
2755,4137-11701-0027.flac,there's no holding udo once he begins volunteered begins volunteered begins volunteered coronel he's the most desperate lover the most desperate lover in araby my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth
2756,4137-11701-0045.flac,was it fair to disappoint one who had perone who had perhaps some little grounds for after all he had been no more ore ore or gallant than was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman it was her her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions
2757,4137-11701-0014.flac,the princess and coronel were upon them they were upon them were upon them ah countess  uch i thought we should find you together said hyacinth archly let me present to you my friend the duke coronel
2758,4137-11701-0036.flac,we can talk quite well like this i am sorry udo udo said coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position it wasn't in the least compromising
2759,4137-11701-0010.flac,father will make you a proper prince directly he comes back will he he that's what i'm wondering you see he doesn't know yet about our little present to the countess but it is quite time we got back to belvane we have left her alone too long
2760,4137-11701-0041.flac,you neve never neer never told me your precious countess whom you expect me expect me to marry how very unkind of her eve her a nasty person to annoy he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully
2761,4137-11701-0026.flac,said hyacinth i felt somehow somehow that it must be coming because you've seen so much of it  each other lately wiggs and i have often talked about it together what has happened to the child thought belvane she isn't a child at all she's grown up
2762,4137-11701-0013.flac,he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvane's face she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him why whoever is this she said getting to her feet before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon
2763,4137-11701-0043.flac,yes but of course the chance might come come again you'd have the thing hanging over you always she's clever you know and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy lovely flowers aren't they what's the name of this one
2764,4137-11701-0034.flac,yes i think you may take you may take ur you may take our word for it that it's true i haven't the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for
2765,4137-11701-0038.flac,ah and who would listen ah and who would listen ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that
2766,4137-11701-0050.flac,i must ask you not to refer to it i do t i do to it if i marry the countess you'll be a very lucky man put in coronel i happen to know that the king of euralia however she's chosen you it seems
2767,4137-11701-0033.flac,there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now
2768,4137-11701-0040.flac,said udo stiffly well perhaps you are right i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way udo who was about to enter the palace turned round with a startled look what do you mean
2769,4137-11701-0032.flac,he said i's the talk of he h he's of araby naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was he's like my dear udo she's charming i congratulate you don't be a fool coronel i haven't the he coronel i haven't the he coronel i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her
2770,4137-11701-0005.flac,be very close coronel she whispered and then they walked out together if any of the servants at the palace were surprised to see coronel they did not show it after all that was their business
2771,4137-11701-0021.flac,explained hyacinth and hearing that there was to be to be a wedding added coronel exded coronel added coronel belvane made up her mind coronel was evidently a very different man from udo if he stayed in euralia as adviser
2772,4137-11701-0006.flac,prince coronel will be staying here said the princess prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both and if they discuss those things in the servants halls of those days
2773,4137-11701-0022.flac,more than adviser she guessed she guessed to hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt an as for the king it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her
2774,4137-11701-0008.flac,but i get no assistance from roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders i say eh said coronel as they went up the grand staircase i'm not a prince you know don't say i have deceived you
2775,4137-11701-0024.flac,udo and i here i here i here she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronel's took udo's boldly without any but any more maidenly nonsense nonsense nonsense udo and i love each other say something udo
2776,4137-11701-0015.flac,udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bebewildered highness on the back aren't you udo and aren't you udo and i can think of no one more suitable in every way he bowed again and turned back to the prince well udo you're looking splendid
2777,4137-11701-0003.flac,it will annoy your father but one can't please ever ever ever everybody oh i can see myself enjoying this they got up and wandered back along wigs's path hand in hand i'm almost afraid to leave the forest said hyacinth
2778,4137-11701-0031.flac,and now said the prince tell me what you are doing here coronel put his ar pet his arm pet his arm in udo's and walked him up and down on the flagged path you're approaching marriage
2779,4137-11701-0020.flac,i rode said coronel it's a secret he added
2780,4137-11701-0042.flac,udo evidently hadn't thought of this he is h is he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened she couldn't do anything
2781,4137-11701-0011.flac,it was more than it was more than udo did just now he was with her in her garden telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull narrowly dull story about an enenencounter of his with the dragon apparently in its dotage to which belvane was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator
2782,4137-11701-0047.flac,after all again why not marry the countess it was abbabsurd to suppose there was anything in coronel's nonsense nonsense but one never knew not that he was marrying her out of fear no certainly not it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part
2783,4137-11701-0030.flac,and with a curtsey she was gone coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth i'm enjoying this he seemed to say well well well she announced i must be going in too there'll be much to see about
2784,4137-11701-0039.flac,once more i am not going to marry her well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story poor innocent girl well let's forget about it and now tell me how do you like euralia
2785,4137-11701-0028.flac,you know of course that his majesty comes back to morrow with all his army she did not swoon or utter a cry she did not plead the vapours or the megrims
2786,4137-11701-0035.flac,oh very well if you're going to drop all your former friends go on then but when i'm married there will always be a place for understand once and for all said udo angrily that i am not getting married no don't take my arm
2787,4137-11701-0017.flac,ah what a mire miracle worker true love is i think one of the things which made belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say
2788,4137-11701-0051.flac,personally i can't make out what she sees in you what is it put it put it i should have thought it was quite ot it was quite ot it was quite obvious said udo with dignity well coronel i think perhaps you are right and that it's my duty to marry her
2789,4137-11701-0037.flac,protested udo indignantly
2790,4137-11701-0007.flac,no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth bless bless her pretty face had found her man at last
2791,4137-11701-0046.flac,of course he ought to have left eure re re ralia long ago but he had stayed on on on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had pay ppy paid rather too much attention to that and he had certainly neglected the princess a little
2792,4137-11701-0025.flac,prompted coronell  er yes said udo very unwillingly and decided that heuthat he tat he would explain it all afterwards whatever his feelings for the feelings for the feelings for the countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage oh i'm so glad
2793,4137-11701-0019.flac,the countess and i were just having a little i was just telling her what you said about how did you get here coronel shall we tell him said coronel with a smile at hyacinth hyacinth nodded
2794,4137-11701-0048.flac,the poor woman had misunderstood him and she  e should not be disappointed she seems fond of flowers said coronel you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you now understand clearly coronel
2795,4137-11701-0023.flac,we didn't want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our our secret your royal highness she looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on
2796,4137-11701-0018.flac,meanwhile udo of course fcourse of course blundered along gaily we aren't exactly princess i mean mean what are you doing here coronel that dear coronel i didn't know princess that you
2797,4137-11701-0052.flac,coronel shook him solemnly by the hand i congratulate your royal highness i will announce your decision to the princess she will be much amute much delighted and he turned into the palace
2798,4137-11701-0009.flac,you are my prince said hyacinth proudly my dear i am a king among men to day and you are who are my queen but that's in our own special country of two if you are so particular said hyacinth with a smile
2799,4137-11701-0012.flac,and then said udo i jumped quickly quickly to the right and whirling my no wait a bit that was later i jumped quickly to my left yes i remember it now it was my left i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my
2800,4137-11701-0029.flac,she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace she said if your royal highness will excuse me
2801,4137-11701-0016.flac,a different thing countess from when i last saw him
2802,4137-11701-0044.flac,udo dropped undecidedly into undecidedly into undecidedly into a seat this is iswanted thinking out the countess what was wrong with her after all and she evidently adored him of course that was not surprising the question was
2803,4137-11701-0049.flac,i'm not in the the the least frightened by the countess my dear udo what a speech for a lover of course you're not not after all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again
2804,4137-11701-0002.flac,we will be her most humble obedient servants she shall have everything she wants including including prince udo smiled hyacinth that's a splendidanantended idea we'll make her have udo
2805,4137-11701-0001.flac,that's what makes is so jolly we can do what we like and it doesn't matter if it doesn't come on bom off so just for fun let's think of something to pay her out i feel i don't want to hurt anybody to day be to deby to day all right we won't hurt her we'll humor her
2806,4137-11701-0000.flac,and now said coronel we'd better better better decide what to do but i don't mind what we do now said hyacinth happily she may have the throne and father and udo and
2807,4018-107338-0025.flac,lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm fom frm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which is in vain endeavoured to degrade them
2808,4018-107338-0032.flac,i'll not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in that i am alone in hat i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely ly fit for business
2809,4018-107338-0022.flac,you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal me means do you not what then is there to fear hear here and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well
2810,4018-107338-0028.flac,the factions and the failures of our opoppressors at this moment guuard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of sybil and morley
2811,4018-107338-0024.flac,morley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are the're always easy the fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
2812,4018-107338-0023.flac,but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirit sybil but sybil but sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet
2813,4018-107338-0021.flac,the factions become united sybil turned the the united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could have tha happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with the the being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
2814,4018-107338-0030.flac,as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land but can we prove it we never had the legal evvidence you are an error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda
2815,4018-107338-0018.flac,you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aris aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil
2816,4018-107338-0026.flac,there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephen's itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
2817,4018-107338-0019.flac,he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
2818,4018-107338-0017.flac,had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part bbut which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
2819,4018-107338-0031.flac,very useful no doubt i hope i shall find them but of no validity if money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter
2820,4018-107338-0020.flac,and yet if anything yet if anything et if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
2821,4018-107338-0027.flac,my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believe that we had on our side my ourside mourside god and the truth they know neither of them in the the the national convention said morley
2822,4018-107338-0029.flac,saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of just just justice that mowbray castle is as much yours
2823,4018-107338-0008.flac,is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness s that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
2824,4018-107338-0012.flac,he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give give give him an appointment an observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me
2825,4018-107338-0009.flac,then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she anced she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withwithdrew i was i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing
2826,4018-107338-0004.flac,and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realized little of the fancies
2827,4018-107338-0016.flac,the mismismismystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sybil there there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here to day he met and addressed me and i only recognized an acquaintance
2828,4018-107338-0001.flac,perhaps i should rather i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things
2829,4018-107338-0005.flac,that that appearance was prepossessing a frank an even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
2830,4018-107338-0007.flac,is the privilege of the people of whom i am one i am one i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was s is addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour thes it is your labour their labour said sybil
2831,4018-107338-0003.flac,and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to and to into sybil she beheld him with with with and with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears
2832,4018-107338-0014.flac,you did well good good good stephen as you always do said sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
2833,4018-107338-0015.flac,hers were kind and calm and this egrem and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
2834,4018-107338-0011.flac,this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first rist at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
2835,4018-107338-0010.flac,he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed he destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
2836,4018-107338-0013.flac,he would propose that i should a he hose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be he woulbe a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought he wought tought hought so much and so we are here
2837,4018-107338-0000.flac,morley morley morley paused as he recognized egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
2838,4018-107338-0006.flac,detract from the favorable defect that he always at once produced
2839,4018-107338-0002.flac,and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
2840,4018-107312-0003.flac,in the in the  the infancy of mowbray by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the in the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labours
2841,4018-107312-0015.flac,i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines soul alive but those shuffle and screw are are are rotten snicky bad yarns said mistress carey

3324,311-124404-0017.flac,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none that he that  could have been none there could have been none in which these laws were not they observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of them that even the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way

3466,2989-138028-0073.flac,samson'sintention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on
3467,2989-138028-0021.flac,and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those those again that from a great beginning have ended a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness

3494,2989-138028-0041.flac,i know what i am saying mistress housekeeper
3495,2989-138028-0051.flac,and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost

3502,2989-138028-0052.flac,and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shrooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs
3503,2989-138028-0009.flac,whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the sun is to be divided whe divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you now nothing about but i do

3508,2952-408-0024.flac,and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed
3509,2952-408-0028.flac,since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them bre one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverend sir
3510,2952-408-0023.flac,for it was evident that his kind hos supposed him for hos supposed him forhos supposed him to have been deluted by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary for a necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived
3511,2952-408-0022.flac,and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject
3512,2952-408-0026.flac,so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rights only as a matter of business
3513,2952-408-0021.flac,the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this his this this village answered muso i called at at at is anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused refused refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment
3514,2952-408-0020.flac,what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said what and said and said about this matter from ancient time muso then ininquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for warm the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked
3515,2952-408-0027.flac,i thought only of the food and the clothes sss that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and bebebecause of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki
3516,2952-408-0004.flac,but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound leep by a sound ofleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment presently partment presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man carrying a lighted lantern entered the room respectfully saluted him and said
3517,2952-408-0005.flac,the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village
3518,2952-408-0011.flac,all then left the house except the priest who went went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been and been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp komyo was burning
3519,2952-408-0019.flac,then muso told of the dim and awful shape that it that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the or the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed
3520,2952-408-0013.flac,but when the hush of the night night night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and a shape vague and ashape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak
3521,2952-408-0018.flac,and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been and unbroken heretofore some great misfortune has followed whenever it is as obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear ter during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause
3522,2952-408-0012.flac,the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village
3523,2952-408-0015.flac,turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered
3524,2952-408-0009.flac,then the other the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the adjoining room having been told of the priest's kind promises then priest's kind promises came to thank him after which the masterssstr of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell
3525,2952-408-0016.flac,and looked about the room no one expressed any any any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverend sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night
3526,2952-408-0006.flac,strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has ora corpse has thus been left so we think think think think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village
3527,2952-408-0008.flac,as it is i shall perform the service after after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone

3529,2952-408-0017.flac,all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to all all are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if ithad been possible but the law of our village as i told you all all you all you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place
3530,2952-408-0007.flac,but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death ofyour father's death of your father's death when i came for though i i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me a ai i could have performed the service before your departure
3531,2952-408-0010.flac,by the rule of ou of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honourable body while we are unable be bleble to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning
3532,2952-408-0001.flac,for a long time time he wandered about helplessly and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night when he perceived on the top the top the tthe top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun one of those little hermitages called
3533,2952-408-0014.flac,he saw that shape lift he  e the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginningat the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body
3534,2952-408-0003.flac,this the old man harshly refused but he directed muso to a certain un muso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining where lodging it the lodging and food could be obtained muso flifafound his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages
3535,2952-408-0002.flac,which are built for solitary priests it seemed to be in ruinous which we in ruinous condition but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest from whom he begged the favor of a knight's lodging
3536,2952-410-0028.flac,gently on bar barring the door he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it he heard voices talking in the grove and he went in the direction of the voices stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place
3537,2952-410-0036.flac,but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree and with that tree he struck the heads as they came knocking them from him with tremendous blows four of them fled buof them fled away but the head of the aruji though battered again and again desperately continued to bound at the priest
3538,2952-410-0052.flac,at the mention of that name hat name that name a murmur of admiration filled the court room for there were many present who remembered it and kwairyo immediately found himself among friends instead of judges friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness
3539,2952-410-0010.flac,and i must assure you sir that it is very dangeand is very danger is very dangerous to sleep here therefore although my house is only a wretched thatched hut let me beg of you b vyou to come home with me at once in the way of away of a way of food i have nothing to offer you but there is a roof at least and you can sleep under it without risk

3543,2952-410-0060.flac,and he could not discover the body therefore he buried the head and he and h had by itself in the grove behind the cottage and he and e an yottage and he had a tombstone set up over the grave and he caused a segaki he caused a segaki service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the rokuro kubi

3547,2952-410-0001.flac,but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone and as his heart remained true to his former lord he preferred to give up the world so he cut off his hair and became a travelling priest taking the buddhist name of kwairyo
3548,2952-410-0023.flac,and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with ith with the night kwairyo felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household
3549,2952-410-0018.flac,kwairyo was pleased by this announcement of ndo dfnd of good resolve and he said to the aruji my frmy friend i have had occasion to observe that man prone to folly in their youth may in after y in after years become very earnest in right living

3573,2952-410-0006.flac,and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of and and tone of a tone of great surprise what kind of man can you be good sir that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this there are haunters about here many of them are you not afraid of hairy things
3574,2952-410-0005.flac,scarcely had he lain e lan tbe lain down when a man came along the road carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood this woodcutter halted on seeing kwaeyo lying down
3575,2952-410-0035.flac,and there he ere he are he is behind that tree hiding behind that tree see him the fat coward in the same moment the head of the arujhi followed by the other four heads sprang at kwairyo
3576,2952-410-0054.flac,a day or two after leaving suwa kwairyo met with a robber who stopped him in a lonesome place and bade him strip kwairyo at once removed his koromo and offered it to the robber who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve
3577,2952-410-0014.flac,from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household i imagine that you have not always been a wood cutter perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classees smiling the woodcutter answered sir you are not mistaken
3578,2952-410-0047.flac,the old man turned it round and round carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters he called the attention of his colleagues to these and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon
3579,2952-410-0007.flac,my friend cheerfully answered kwairyo i am only a wandering priest a cloud and water guest as folks call it
3580,2952-410-0003.flac,so he resigned himself to pass the night under the the stars and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside he lay down there son there and prepared to sleep
3581,2952-410-0038.flac,but its teeth still held teeth still held the sleeve and for all his great strength kwairyo could not force open the jaws with the head stil the head still the head still hanging to his sleeve he went he went back to the house and there caught sight of the other four rokuro kubi squatting together
3582,2952-410-0058.flac,take the thing said kwairyo i was not joking
3583,2952-410-0021.flac,then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sthe sthe sutras by the light of a paper lantern until a late hour he continued to read and pray
3584,2952-410-0034.flac,since my body has been moved to rereerejoin it is not possible then i must die and all through the work of that priest
3585,2952-410-0017.flac,retribution followed me and retribution followed me and i long remained a fugitive in the land now i often pray pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did and to reestablish the ancestral home but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing
3586,2952-410-0059.flac,and he then became afraid that the spirit of the rokurokubi might give him trouble so he made up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had come and to bury it with its body he found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of kai but nobody was there
3587,2952-410-0012.flac,slippery roots for the foot to rest upon him sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock but at last kwairyo found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead and he saw before him a small thatched cottage
3588,2952-410-0039.flac,with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies but when but when they perceived him at the back door all screamed the priest the priest and fled through the other door with the other doorway out into the woods eastward the sky was brightening day was about to dawn
3589,2952-410-0053.flac,when kwairyo left suwa he was as happy suwa he was as hap suwa he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world as for the head he he he took it with him jocosely insisting that he intendeed it for a miyage and now it only remains to tell what became of the head
3590,2952-410-0048.flac,on the contrary the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leap  leaf detaches itself from the itself from the sitself from the stem then said the elder i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth his is the head of a rokuro kubi
3591,2952-410-0037.flac,and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe kwairyo aan kwairyo an kwairyo however as quickly gripped the head by its topknot and repeatedly as and is struck it it did not release its hold but uttered a long and a old but uttered a long moan and thereafter ceased to struggle it was dead
3592,2952-410-0031.flac,to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult and we be difficult and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing
3593,2952-410-0040.flac,and kwairyo knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all folled with blood and foam and clay and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself
3594,2952-410-0042.flac,seized the priest and took him to jail for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who in the moment of being killed had caught the murder semurdered murderer's sleeve in his teeth as the kwairyo he only smiled and ssasasaid nothing when they questioned him
3595,2952-410-0043.flac,so after having passed a night in prison he was brought before the magistrates of the disdisdistrict then he was ordered to explain how he a priest had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve and why he had dare dare dare dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people
3596,2952-410-0056.flac,kwairyo answered i shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist but i must tell you that this is not the head of a man it is a goblin's head so if you buy it and have any trouble in consequence please to remember that you were not deceived by me
3597,2952-407-0010.flac,or bell of muge ugen now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied though not described by the verb
3598,2952-407-0005.flac,evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the a mirror to the mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving she had not presented her of anbrfbroffering with all her heart and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to being attached to being attached to the mirror kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace
3599,2952-407-0024.flac,if by striking upon the wash basin of umegae i could make honourable money come to me
3600,2952-407-0008.flac,but the bell proved proved proved to be a good bell and it bravely withstood their assaults nevertheless the people were not easily discourged but but that easily discouraged day after day at all hours they continued to ring the b but butbut bell furiously carying nothing whatever for the protests of the priests
3601,2952-407-0006.flac,of course everybody heard of the matter and everybody soon knew knew knew whose mirror it was that would not melt melt and because of this public exposure of her secret fault the poor poor poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry and as she could not bear the shame she drowned herself
3602,2952-407-0015.flac,so much will twill perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazoraeru the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples but for present purposes the following will serve if you should make a little man of straw
3603,2952-407-0012.flac,to compare to liken but the asto cliasthiasoteric meaning is to substitute an imagination one objector tor to their action for another so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result
3604,2952-407-0022.flac,crying out at the same time for three hundred pieces of gold a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping
3605,2952-407-0001.flac,who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for well metal but afterwards she much regretted her mirror she remembered things that her mother had told her about it and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her who who put to her to her mother but to her mother's mother and grandmother and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected
3606,2952-407-0007.flac,after having written a farewell letter containing these these at these words when i am im i am dead it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell but to the person who the person who at person who breaks that bell by ringing it great wealth will be given by the ghost of me
3607,2952-407-0023.flac,afterwards a song was made about umegae's basin of bronze and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day umegae no chozuwachitateite
3608,2952-407-0002.flac,but she had not the money necessary whenever she went to the the the temple she saw her mirror lying in the courtyard behind a railing among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together she knew it by the shochikubai in relief on the back of it those three fortunate efortunate defortunate emblems of pine bamboo and plum flour
3609,2952-407-0009.flac,so the ringing became an affliction and the priests could not endure it and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a a a swamp the swamp was deep and swallowed it up and that was the end of the bell
3610,2952-407-0011.flac,the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic as well as as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith
3611,2952-407-0018.flac,the soles of the defeat of the robber will become inflamed and will allow him no rest until he returns of his own accord to put himsethethe simshimself at your mercy that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazoraru
3612,2952-407-0016.flac,for the same reason that sister helen made it a little man of wax and nail it
3613,2952-407-0019.flac,after the bell had been rolled into the swamp there the swamp there the swamp there was of course no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it
3614,2952-407-0003.flac,which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and which and wend which and hide it that she might thereafter treasure it always but the chance did not come and she became very unhappy felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life
3615,2952-407-0017.flac,that would illuilluillustrate one signification of nazoraru or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large maxa on each of them
3616,2952-407-0020.flac,but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and bugangan brak objects imaginatively substituted for the bell thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble one of these persons was a woman called umegae
3617,2952-407-0027.flac,and they opened it together and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with

3619,2952-407-0013.flac,for example you cannot afford to build a buddhis temple but temple but temple but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple
3620,2952-407-0025.flac,became great and many people followed the example of umega bibiumegae thereby hoping to emulate her luck
3621,2952-407-0014.flac,you cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy one volumes of the buddhist texts but you can make a revolving library containing them turn round by pushing it like a windlass
3622,2952-407-0021.flac,while the pair were travelling together kajiuwaro one day found himself in great straits for want of money and numegae remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it
3623,2952-407-0004.flac,a saying mystically expressed by the chinese of chinese the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors and she feared of mirrors and she feared mirrors and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody
3624,2952-407-0000.flac,even to day in the courts of certain japanese temples you may see heaps of old e heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose the larkthlarkev larkelargest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the ivof the jodo sect at hakata in kushu
3625,2836-5355-0001.flac,she pursued bending her eyes determinately upon him it must be with with with all my heart rejoined sir francis it is you have thrown out the challenge mind
3626,2836-5355-0019.flac,quite true was her reply i and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabel if it will be be any satisfaction to you to hear it since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse it is of no consequence to smooth over facts

3630,2836-5355-0022.flac,her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone her face was more flushed than it had had her had been throughout the interview he spoke quietly now quite in an equal tone of reasoning it was his way when the ill temper was upon him
3631,2836-5355-0048.flac,then he paid a visit to the landlord the landlord and handed him likewise a year's rent in advance making the same remark after that he ordered dinner at a hotel and the same night he and he and pierre departed on their journey home again
3632,2836-5355-0042.flac,don't i don't i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm her herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will don't if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it

3635,2836-5355-0010.flac,well isabel you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks but her voice sounded calm as before
3636,2836-5355-0005.flac,what fancies you d do do take up uttered francis levison sometimes subsequent to your depart sire she quietly went on while on of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets
3637,2836-5355-0018.flac,whose fits of ill temper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger towards your husband
3638,2836-5355-0029.flac,who is he like isabel my handsome self isabel my handsome self were he he he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided

3640,2836-5355-0002.flac,when you left in july you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage you know what i mean when i say in time but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise he interrupted but no sooner had i set my foot in london
3641,2836-5355-0030.flac,outwardly into calmness again what else out again what else retorted sir francis you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me
3642,2836-5355-0052.flac,excepting that it was connected with etexconnected with exconnected with the office and old mister dill and that mister carlyle laughed when he told it they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter she awoke
3643,2836-5355-0046.flac,i wish you a good day so you will not even shake hands with me isabel i would prefer not and thus s alic as they parted sir francis left the room but not immediately the house he went into a distant apartment

3645,2836-5355-0034.flac,i received these from from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so
3646,2836-5355-0014.flac,and bring a clergyman into the room to perform this ceremony it would and would be futile the injury to the child can never be repaired and for myself i cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you

3649,2836-5355-0007.flac,he should should have less trouble in throwing off the mask but he was an ill tempered pan and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now lady isabel continued
3650,2836-5355-0036.flac,if it be be be be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so oo o he said i must confess i think it may be the wisest course as things have come to this pass for a a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable
3651,2836-5355-0049.flac,sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks
3652,2836-5355-0017.flac,you ladies should think of that beforehand yes she said hirtly answered may heaven help all to do so who maybe who may be tempted as i was if if you mean that as a reproach to me it's rather out of place chafed sir francis

3655,2836-5355-0039.flac,sarcastically rejoined sir fran francis generous man a flush deep and painful dyed her cheeks i should i should have said my late husband you need not have reminded me of the mistake

3657,2836-5355-0037.flac,remember though that it is your doing not mine but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel a sum we will fix upon the amount amicably
3658,2836-5355-0015.flac,if you have taken this aversion to me at cannot be helped he coldly said inwardly congratulating himself let us not doubt doubt doubt at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation
3659,2836-5355-0041.flac,whom do you take me for what who take me for what do you take me for she repeated rising in her bitter mortification if you have put me beyond the pal of the world iam still lord mount severn's daughter you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as
3660,2836-5355-0011.flac,when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed
3661,2836-5355-0026.flac,as she turned her indignant eyes toward him sir francis laughed all stratagems are fair in love and war she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb

3663,2836-5355-0023.flac,and the calmer he spoke the more cutting were his words he need not have told her this what was the secret she inquired in a low tone nay i can't explain all they did not take me into their confidence they did not even take you
3664,2836-5355-0006.flac,i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning aceived on the morning of your departure it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced she spoke so quietly so apparently without feeling or passion that sir francis was agreeably astonished
3665,2836-5355-0027.flac,over his shoulder his shoulder in the direction of the cradle what have you named that young article there the name which ought to have been his by inheritance
3666,2836-5355-0040.flac,if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child he at any rate falls to my share i shall give you a few hundred a year with him she beat her hands before her fore her as if beating off the man and his words

3670,2836-5355-0021.flac,and i say i think you are on the wrong scent i do not believe mister carlyle ever thought of the girl in that way what o you you mean she gasped they had a secret between them  secret between them a secret between them not of love a secret of business and those interviews they had together
3671,2836-5355-0025.flac,what reason i must request you to tell me i overheard scraps of the te thetheir conversation now and then in those meetings and so gathered my information you told a different tale to me sir francis was her remark

3698,2836-5354-0025.flac,it was over then and all claim to the and all claim to the and all claim to the name of carlyle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabel forever captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket is there any news she asked
3699,2836-5354-0054.flac,in a subdued quiet tone not to draw too near as as as any little excitement made her faint now he took a seat an took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot as ehe explained that he really could not get away from town before
3700,2836-5354-0053.flac,the girl departed closing the door and lady isabel sat looking at it schooling her patience another moment and it was flung open sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in she waved him off begging him

3704,2836-5354-0049.flac,and she shook and shivered perpetually though she had drawn so close to the wood fire the wood fire the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and interpose between them and the crackling logs
3705,2836-5354-0046.flac,you will wait you will wait i cannot wait he replied his tone changing to one of determination it is useless uluseless useless to urge it he broke from her and left the room and in another minute had left the house pierre attending him a feeling amounting to a conviction

3708,2836-5354-0039.flac,there has been no delay quite the contrary but it may be expected hourly now you are worrying yourself for nothing isabel i shall be back in time he quitted the room as he spoke and lady isabel remained in it the image of despair
3709,2836-5354-0009.flac,reputation home all that makes life of value to woman she had forfeited her duty to god and deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison

3711,2836-5354-0006.flac,lady wife mother should you ever be tempted to let to abandon your home so will you awake whatever try trials may be the lot of your married life lelthough they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature
3712,2836-5354-0004.flac,she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror from which there was never more any escape never more never more the very instant the very night of her departure she awoke to what she had done the guilt
3713,2836-5354-0000.flac,nearly a year went by lady isabel carlyle had spent it on the continent that refuge for such fugitives now moving about from place to place with her companion now stationary and alone quite half the time
3714,2836-5354-0012.flac,furnished in the vicinity of the place grenette a windy for a windy for a windy old house it was full of doors and windows chimneys and cupboards and he said he should remain there lady isabel remonstrated
3715,2836-5354-0020.flac,little thought she that there was not was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation any more than he had made it made it made it to others who had gone beefor her she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself
3716,2836-5354-0011.flac,it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings and she knew that her whole future existence whether spent with that man man or without him would be a dark course it be a dark course of gnawing retribution nearly a year went by save some six or eight weeks
3717,2836-5354-0017.flac,and all the time the sly fox the time the sly fox the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket but he was only obeying the orders of his master his master his master it had been captain levison's recent pleasure the pleasure that the newspapers should not be seen by lady isabel until he had overlooked them
3718,2836-5354-0007.flac,the endurance of woman to bear resolve to bear them fall down upon your knees and pray to be enabled to bear them pray for patience pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape bear unti death
3719,2836-5354-0003.flac,when instead of the garden of roses when garden of roses it had been her persuader's pleasure to promise her she would fall into but which in truth she had barely glanced at for that had not been her moving motive
3720,2836-5354-0010.flac,but the instant the step was irrevocable the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance set in even in the first days of her departure in the fleeting moments of abandonment when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience
3721,2836-5354-0018.flac,you will speedilyy gather his motive pierre departed through captain levison's room and lady isabel took up the the letters and examined their superscription with interest itwas known to her that mister carlyle had not lost a moment
3722,2836-5354-0016.flac,languidly she took her seat at the table table just as captain levison's servant a frenchman whom servant a frenchman whom servant a frenchman whom he had engaged in paris entered the room with two letters point de gazette pierre
3723,2836-5354-0021.flac,the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest slavens in than domestic privacy he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy and she as apathetically answered to it pierre says there are some letters he began
3724,2836-5354-0023.flac,and they are both in the scene ore both in the same handwriting your solicitors i believe up went his hand at the last word and he made a sort of grab wit the letters stalked to the farthest window and and the farthest window and the farthest window opened it and glanced over its contents sir
3725,2836-5354-0015.flac,a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health healh health she knew better knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart it was very late for breakfast breakfast breakfast but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day
3726,2836-5354-0022.flac,last out a whole ten months you are in agregious ererlater laterer compliments the very opposite to honey li opposite to honey and sweetness have generally supervened long before try it if you don't believe me two letters she continued
3727,2836-5354-0013.flac,she wished to go farther on where they might get quicker news from england but her will now was as nothing she was looking like the ghost of her former self talk of her having looked ill when she took the voyage over the water with mister carlyle you should have seen her now
3728,2836-5354-0005.flac,whose aspect had been shunned in the porspective assumed at once its true frightful color the blacknes  the blackness  the blackness of darkness and a lively remorse a never dying anguish took possess dying anguish took possession of her soul for ever o reader believe me
3729,2836-5354-0001.flac,taking one absence with the other he had been away from her chiefly in paris pursuing his own course and his own pleasure how fared it with lady is tak us tak us isabel just as it must be expected to fare and does fare
3730,2836-5354-0002.flac,when a high principled gentlewoman falls from her pedestal never had she experienced a moment's calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion
3731,2836-5354-0019.flac,in seeking a divorce and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected she was anxious for it anxious that capt n for it anxious that cpt o it anxious that captain levison should render her the in her the i her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child
3732,2836-5354-0008.flac,rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience for be be assured that russure that sure that the alternative if you do rush on to it will be found worse than death ond worse than death ond worse than death poor thing poor lady isabel she had sacrificed husband children
3733,2836-5354-0024.flac,we beg to inform you that the suit carlyle versus carlyle is at an end the divorce was pronounced without opposition according to your request we hasten to forward you the earliest intimation of the fact we are sir faithfully yours moss and grab
3734,2518-154826-0033.flac,these smugglers smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hhihillside come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
3735,2518-154826-0014.flac,and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the sun's heat feat feat fat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now tis different
3736,2518-154826-0021.flac,that lay at random on the green turf te green turf hgreen turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the that ws e that was a wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty
3737,2518-154826-0003.flac,and i fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second
3738,2518-154826-0004.flac,there was the being known by the excise  for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all
3739,2518-154826-0001.flac,with the straight sun path across it spangled and wwoon and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief with with with of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken
3740,2518-154826-0024.flac,enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall
3741,2518-154826-0043.flac,which was just putting on the brighter green of spring wich with green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment which had covered for the most part
3742,2518-154826-0052.flac,he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand
3743,2518-154826-0036.flac,then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hill brow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is past already
3744,2518-154826-0026.flac,but elzevir passed him the time of day an of day in of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave a hood back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer top was the answer
3745,2518-154826-0049.flac,there he said this is joseph's pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry
3746,2518-154826-0010.flac,it was afternoon for the sun was past the meridian and and very hot for the time for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
3747,2518-154826-0048.flac,and the sward crept over the edges of the and the the the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps
3748,2518-154826-0012.flac,behind one one of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttress ing ivy and buttress ting ivy and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush elvir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry thee no farther for this present
3749,2518-154826-0034.flac,and so i said as much to elzevir who only only only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and therethere there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough
3750,2518-154826-0005.flac,there came before my eyes that gray face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of a sleep
3751,2518-154826-0042.flac,from the bottom of this shaft there r spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly six feet high but sometimes only three or four and in these the arble is dug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves
3752,2518-154826-0040.flac,although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excexcexcavations comes that black purbec marble which you see in old churchis in our country
3753,2518-154826-0011.flac,the ground was brashy with flat stones and dididivided up into tillage fields it was a bleak asa bleak sa bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for tewoud never pay for woud never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
3754,2518-154826-0041.flac,and i am told in other parts of england as well and the th the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned a skew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then
3755,2518-154826-0018.flac,and now that i was under the lee of the wall
3756,2518-154826-0046.flac,on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of these shafts
3757,2518-154826-0039.flac,elzevir was still walking strongly in spite of the in spite of the in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of vanville point
3758,2518-154826-0029.flac,and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
3759,2518-154826-0002.flac,and the wind which a few ad few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seemed now now now andnow but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but  and and the kindly sea but a kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew apace
3760,2518-154826-0037.flac,we must have slept three hours hours or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john tis one the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posse might have ad us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with a lusty stride
3761,2518-154826-0031.flac,the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion
3762,2518-154826-0038.flac,and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again
3763,2518-154826-0013.flac,though there is not now much farther to go we have the h the past perbect gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon
3764,2518-154826-0027.flac,have you got a charge of you got a charge of powder to spare said elzevir showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows he whispered to me to lie still
3765,2518-154826-0023.flac,and though i could see nothing i knew and knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put it a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
3766,2518-154826-0032.flac,for while he spoke i for i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied around my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the fire lock
3767,2518-154826-0009.flac,that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
3768,2518-154826-0051.flac,and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
3769,2518-154826-0008.flac,and so he took he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell of of of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished wished wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish
3770,2518-154826-0053.flac,and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down
3771,2518-154826-0019.flac,and gets at at t at length into the shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzevir i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to lull me to slumber
3772,2518-154826-0016.flac,i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make think this whistle sound and he took maskew's silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly
3773,2518-154826-0025.flac,we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall and so elzevir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off
3774,2518-154826-0045.flac,and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush
3775,2518-154826-0020.flac,then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
3776,2518-154826-0017.flac,with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall of the wall of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west
3777,2518-154826-0006.flac,and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time time time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
3778,2518-154826-0007.flac,this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbec which they call joseph's pit is pit hs pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there
3779,2518-154826-0050.flac,and before they come to where we lie lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to by by by them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as one goes down a hatchway
3780,2518-154826-0030.flac,but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or a buzzard or something fit to cook come come come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth but worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more said elzevir the tempter
3781,2518-154826-0035.flac,but when elzevir sat down the boy gave a careful look round look round and seeing no one watching any more
3782,2518-154826-0015.flac,so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up
3783,2518-154826-0022.flac,but would go on for millions an millionmillimillions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic e numeration was fast cannumeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
3784,2518-154826-0054.flac,and carrying and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and let a match
3785,2518-154826-0028.flac,no time was wasted time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy t it was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy
3786,2518-154826-0000.flac,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver gray film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
3787,2518-154826-0047.flac,for if it were not for this holy purpose the manpus the bandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low
3788,2518-154826-0044.flac,though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble thec of broken ruble ch of broken rubble peering out at the top of the mound there were many tumble down walls and low gables left a the cottages of the old quarrymen the thillrymen grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds
3789,2518-154825-0031.flac,but open not thy eyes till till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again
3790,2518-154825-0039.flac,both were on all fours now elzevir first fours now elzevir first and i following but as i crept along i relaxed care for a moment and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down and far below
3791,2518-154825-0042.flac,and how he did it in such a narrow strate i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight
3792,2518-154825-0008.flac,and he jerked his thumb at maskew
3793,2518-154825-0045.flac,and in five more they will be yon the under cliff and if we ever ever and ever reached the top who knows but they have left a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man man knows of the zigzag and if they knew
3794,2518-154825-0052.flac,now i was so besotted with fright that i tai i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not poppopull a helpless lump backwards up that path
3795,2518-154825-0054.flac,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright a falling left me in a moment
3796,2518-154825-0044.flac,so i gave out one gave out one gave out one two three and while i went on and on and on counting heard him repeating to himself though his words seemed thin and far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here
3797,2518-154825-0000.flac,how fearful and dizzy tis to cast one one eyes so low i'll look no more
3798,2518-154825-0041.flac,felt a sickening and qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i felt must fall then i must fall thn i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over fhomov om over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff
3799,2518-154825-0051.flac,move thou must and his better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him
3800,2518-154825-0029.flac,thus he went on for a time that seemed without e re re rend and yet was really but a minute or two and by or two and by degrees i felt the wind wind that we could scarce perceive it all on the under cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliffs side
3801,2518-154825-0010.flac,and they will take and and take take thee alive and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail i felt cific with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end
3802,2518-154825-0024.flac,we have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hour's start or more for they will take all that to search the under cliff and maskew too
3803,2518-154825-0003.flac,safe with a discharged discharged pistol in our grasp and a shot man lying at our feet elzevir our feet elzevir our feet elzevir was the first to speak can you stand john is the bone broken
3804,2518-154825-0018.flac,tis better far to die upon die upon die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hail us off to jail and with that that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg
3805,2518-154825-0009.flac,and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me thou didst make me waste a charge in air so one thing we can do is to wait here until and here until they come and i can account for a few of few o and few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg
3806,2518-154825-0032.flac,the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee ety n and thou must creep rond round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff
3807,2518-154825-0027.flac,in a minute i knew from elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path even free and untrammelled
3808,2518-154825-0005.flac,ever so little it caused me sharp pain for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot ever they have broke the leg though it bleeds little elzevir said we have no time to splice it here
3809,2518-154825-0048.flac,i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes
3810,2518-154825-0049.flac,i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent ent bent bent grass and the chiding cries of the gull seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain n and broken leg and flang myself off self off self off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said
3811,2518-154825-0040.flac,i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror i and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought u of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
3812,2518-154825-0016.flac,yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry thee some way and where there is no room to carry
3813,2518-154825-0012.flac,there is yet yt e yet another way that we may try and if thou hadst but two hold to hold to hold legs i would have tried it and now tis a little short of madness and yet if thou fearest not i will still try it
3814,2518-154825-0013.flac,just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle path leads at leads down but not a hundred yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts
3815,2518-154825-0037.flac,and then while he knelt down upon the path
3816,2518-154825-0046.flac,like setting guillemots against guilemotes against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
3817,2518-154825-0056.flac,thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later think later tater later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us
3818,2518-154825-0021.flac,for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face
3819,2518-154825-0053.flac,so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskew's body
3820,2518-154825-0030.flac,and then the path grew the path grew te path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop
3821,2518-154825-0035.flac,forgetting what i suffered cried out quicken thy pace lad if thou canst thou canst the time is short now so frail is wort now so frail is man's temper that though he was doing more than any ever i forgdi ordifrdid to save another's life and was all i had to trust to in the world yet
3822,2518-154825-0020.flac,and twas a task that might cow the bravest and when i lok i looki looki looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below
3823,2518-154825-0011.flac,so only gave a sigh wishing heartily that besigh wishing heartily that esigh wishing heartily that maskew were not dead and that my leg leg were not broke but that i was back again at the whynot or even hearing one of doctor sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlour
3824,2518-154825-0019.flac,and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the under cliff
3825,2518-154825-0022.flac,faugh said elzevir tis a poor bebebebeast has lost his foothold his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag
3826,2518-154825-0015.flac,i nenever heard but one had climbed it and that was land or jordan when the excise was on his heels half a century back but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight
3827,2518-154825-0017.flac,it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall
3828,2518-154825-0028.flac,and not a man in all the world to dodo it with a full grown lad in his arms yet elzevir made no bones of it ror spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot
3829,2518-154825-0055.flac,and i could ul uld open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands an hands and knees and elzevir
3830,2518-154825-0007.flac,we have a quarter of an hour of an hour of an hour before the posse can get down to us but come they will and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty
3831,2518-154825-0002.flac,and twas only shooting at a venture we were safe but for how short a time safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us
3832,2518-154825-0036.flac,but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arm up in his arms so i lay flat n on on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
3833,2518-154825-0050.flac,there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are loct are lost pluck up thy courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot
3834,2518-154825-0047.flac,thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton
3835,2518-154825-0006.flac,but i will put a kerchief round and while i wrap it listen how we lie and then choose lie and then choose what we shall do i but i nodded biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me and he went on
3836,2518-154825-0004.flac,i cannot stand i said there is something gone in my leg and i feel blood running down into my boot he knelt knelt knelt and rolled down the leg of my stocking but though he only moved my foot
3837,2518-154825-0001.flac,shakespeare the while chalk was a the the bulwark between us and the foe and though one or two of them loosed off their matchlocks trying to get at us aasideways they could not even see their quarry
3838,2518-154825-0025.flac,will keep them in check a little while they  t they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if wewe fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning
3839,2518-154825-0023.flac,and leave me and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and tis too late now to change counsel
3840,2518-154825-0034.flac,but spent much time that was so precious in ttravelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for m bow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce but fierce fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he
3841,2518-154825-0014.flac,where the unthe undercliff dies back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it and of men
3842,2518-154825-0038.flac,putting my arms round his neck and so he bore pt poor me pickaback i shut my i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another ut put ting another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
3843,2518-154825-0043.flac,i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that i shi shquit of that quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint
3844,2518-154825-0026.flac,so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open open open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
3845,2518-154825-0033.flac,for there is no room to dance hornpipes here and hold thy eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither chalk wall looking neither down nor seaward twas well he told me what to do and well i did it
3846,2436-2481-0021.flac,i told him about anita carter cut in on us from the chart room stop that you fools we cut off fully dressed i flung myself on my bed anita might die i must have fallen into a
3847,2436-2481-0029.flac,and hear him i don't want to kill you want to kill you haljan we need you he gather gather gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms carried me swiftly across the deserted deck
3848,2436-2481-0006.flac,moa with a night robe drawn tight around her drawn tight around her thin tall figure edged up to me what has happened setajan
3849,2436-2481-0033.flac,miko got into her stateroom and tried to force his love upon her his love upon her she repulsed him he killed her it struck me blank and then with a rush came the thought
3850,2436-2481-0017.flac,it wasn't wasn't broken the assailant opened it somehow and asaulted an assaulted miss prince shut her in the chest with a heat ray her left lung shot her yes but she did not see who did it
3851,2436-2481-0004.flac,he paused at the sound of captain carter's voice behind us was it from in there wait a moment t carter dashed up he had a large heat ray projector in his hand he shoved us aside let me me in first is the door sealed
3852,2436-2481-0037.flac,the door of the door of the shining garden was closed a brief glimpse given to me and to her to her to her of what might have been and now
3853,2436-2481-0032.flac,she told us before she died died i leaptd to my feet she died yes gregg an hour ago
3854,2436-2481-0014.flac,but why why whom had george prince been in in his own room when the attack came i thought now i recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with doctor frank
3855,2436-2481-0036.flac,we don't want him killed not attacked even not yet we'll explain later they sat me down calming me anita dead
3856,2436-2481-0003.flac,passengers standing at their cabin doors i shouted go back to your to your rooms we want order here keep back we came to the twin doors of a twenty two and a twenty both were closed doctor frank was an advance of snap and me now
3857,2436-2481-0008.flac,the captain rasped get out haljan
3858,2436-2481-0007.flac,i could see only carter but i heard the murmuring voice of doctor frank
3859,2436-2481-0001.flac,was stilled but now we heard a commemotion inside the rasp of opening cabin doors questions from frightened passengers i found my voice anita anita prince come on
3860,2436-2481-0018.flac,nor did prince her scream awakened him
3861,2436-2481-0012.flac,i'll be there presently gregg he slammed the the the door upon me i followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror the turmoil of the ship gradually quieted snap went to the radio room
3862,2436-2481-0022.flac,tortured sleep i was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer tortfound of my alarm buzzer someone was tampering with my door then the buzzer ceased totuzzer ceased the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it tobut it had done its work awakened me
3863,2436-2481-0010.flac,tell blackstone what's happened but i don't know what's happened carter was grim and white

3865,2436-2481-0000.flac,doctor frank's face had gone white snap stood like like like a statue of horror the deck here was patched as always ice with silver radiance from the deck ports the empty the empty the empty deck chair stood about the scream
3866,2436-2481-0034.flac,we must get him i gathered my wits a surge of hate swept me a wild desire for vengeance why by god where is he
3867,2436-2481-0025.flac,was empty but i leaped and struck a solid solid body crouching in the doorway a giant man

3882,2436-2481-0002.flac,he was dashing for the lounge archway doctor frank and i followed i realized that we passed the deck door and window of a twenty two but they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside
3883,2436-2481-0005.flac,doctor frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon snap and me i was unarmed weapon in hand and and and snap forced the panic stricken passengers back to their stricken passengers back to their stricken passengers back to their rooms snap reassured them glibly
3884,2436-2477-0025.flac,i saw the door open and close i i i even thought i could see his blurred outline she added why should george prince be sneaking around with you after him and the purser acting innocent
3885,2436-2477-0027.flac,here's something i can tell you now we've two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard do you know that who are they shack and dud artley every detective in greater new york knows them

3890,2436-2477-0030.flac,they wanted to know what kind of a kind of a kind of a ship this was why because shack has acute little eavesdropping microphone of his own he had it working last night he overheard george prince and that

3898,2436-2477-0009.flac,don't be silly venza i enjoyed her i g eu u gazed at her small slim figure reclining in the deck chair her long gray robe parted by design i have no doubt to display her shapely satin sheathed legs
3899,2436-2477-0018.flac,she stared at me i had not answered her her grin my mind was too busy with queer fancies halsey's fancies halsey's words things are not always not always what they seem were these passengers masqueraders were they put here by george prints
3900,2436-2477-0006.flac,with the black heavens and the with the black heavens and the with black heavens and the blazing stars was before her there was an empty seat near by she greeted me with the venus form of jocula or intimate greening holo lo gregg sit here with me

3902,2436-2477-0001.flac,and it took and took only a few minutes every twelve hours i had a moment with carter in the isolation of his chart room this voyage gregg i'm getting like you too fanciful we've ou too fanciful we've normal group of passengers apparently
3903,2436-2477-0010.flac,her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck her carmine lips were parted with a mocking alluring smile the exotic perfume of her enveloped me she glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes
3904,2436-2477-0005.flac,we'll all meet here gregg say about the zero hour we must take some precautions then he dismissed me i found venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck a port hole
3905,2436-2477-0017.flac,do you know obhahn i interrupted she shook her head never heard of him he told me plenty at breakfast by satan what a flow of of of words that devil driver can muster he and the englishmen don't mesh very well do they

4211,2007-149877-0041.flac,nevertheless the fact that here men gather here chatterer here love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires
4212,2007-149877-0027.flac,hurstwood knew caryoe quite well having drunk a glass now and then with him in company with several others when the conversation was general

4221,2007-149877-0040.flac,it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans that politicians would not gather here in company here in company to discuss anything anything save formalities where the sharp eared may hear and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst
4222,2007-149877-0028.flac,a moderate sense of of humor and could tell a good story when the occasion required he could talk races with hurstwood

4233,2007-149877-0044.flac,no evil could come out of the conpon contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber the worst effect of such such such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the material minded an ambition to arrange their lives to arrange their lives to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis
4234,2007-149877-0019.flac,hundreds of actors merchants politicians and the general general general run of successful characters about town and it was it was it was part of his success to do so he had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship which improved from the how do you do
4235,2007-149877-0012.flac,he had been pointed out as a very successful and a very successful and wa a very successful and well known man about town hurstwood looked the part for besides being part for besides being slightly under forty he had a forty he had a good stout constitution an active manner and a solid substantial air

4237,2007-149877-0047.flac,and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber
4238,2007-149877-0015.flac,and capable of creating a good  impression his managerial position was fairly important a kind of stewardship which was imposing but lacked financial control he had risen by perseverance and industry
4239,2007-149877-0039.flac,here come the moth moths in endless procession to bask in the light of the flame such conversation as one may hhe here would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds

4244,2007-149877-0045.flac,in the last analysis that would would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations but rather of the innate trend of the mind that such such a scene might might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed
4245,2007-149877-0034.flac,george evans was in here saturday and said he saw you in milwaukee last week awaukee last week yes i saw i saw i saw george returned drouet great old boy isn't he we had quite a time there together

4251,2007-149877-0013.flac,which was composed in part of his fine which fine clothes his clean linen his jewels and abn an above all his own sense of his importance drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing

4254,2007-149877-0053.flac,drouet followed him thwwith his eyes much interested doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits does he said drouet

4256,2007-149877-0001.flac,there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whis glass of plain whisk glass of plain whisky and purchased a couple of cigdegcigars one of which he lighted this to him represented in part high life represented in part high life a fair sample of what the whole must be
4257,2007-149877-0010.flac,the long bar was a blaze of lights polished woodwork colored and cut glassware and many fancy bottles
4258,2007-149877-0032.flac,friday said drouet had said drouet had a fine trip glad of it said hurstwood his black eyes sslit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make believe that usually dwelt in them what are you going to take he added as as the bar keeper in snowy jacket and tie

4260,2007-132570-0057.flac,i heard my own voice rejoined montoni sternly and nothing else
4261,2007-132570-0027.flac,opposite to her casement she was for a moment inclined to a moment inclined to a moment inclined to believe it was valancourt whom she had seen yet if it was he why did he he ht he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so and if he was a prisoner in the castle
4262,2007-132570-0038.flac,which she obeyed with trembling and on her way thither endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of valancourt montoni was alone i sent for you said he to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions
4263,2007-132570-0054.flac,for though your repentance would put an immediate end to or opposition it would not now appease my my indignation i will have vengeance as well as justice was justice another groan filled the pause which montoni made
4264,2007-132570-0052.flac,resumed his discourse in a lower yet resresterner voice i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me
4265,2007-132570-0037.flac,the possibility that valancourt was near her revived her fortitude she determined to brave the threatened vengeance at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoni requiring her attendance in the cedar parlor
4266,2007-132570-0049.flac,yet this it appears has not been sufficient to deter you
4267,2007-132570-0048.flac,night repeated another voice montn repeated another voice montoni paused and turned half round but seeming to recollect himself himself he proceeded in a lower tone you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly
4268,2007-132570-0026.flac,but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so so then you have ma'am emily looked displeased and made no reply as she mused upon the recollected appearance which had lately so much alarmed her and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself
4269,2007-132570-0035.flac,and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellensa to catch up men and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms
4270,2007-132570-0051.flac,yet something like a shade of fear passed overyet over yet oer yet over his countenance emily sat down in a chair near the door for the various the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her but montoni paused scarcely an instant in commanding his features
4271,2007-132570-0044.flac,from her infancy regarded an act of injustice inspired her with a noble though imprudent from noble though imprudent courage sign the papers said montoni papers said montoni more impatiently than before never sir
4272,2007-132570-0047.flac,you have dared to question my right now dare you are to question my power you power i have a punishment which you think not of it is is you is terrible this night this very night this
4273,2007-132570-0060.flac,whom she noticed no no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were whom were perhaps bringing to the castle at length having reached her apartment she threw herself upon on the couch overcome with the new horrors of her situation
4274,2007-132570-0023.flac,but will fall too cutting and slash but too cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men no no says i there is rererereason in all things
4275,2007-132570-0033.flac,but she cannot hear them now poor soul said i emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired annette to go and make inquiry concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle
4276,2007-132570-0040.flac,if i have no no no right in these estates sir said emily of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them if the lands are yours by law you certainly may possess certainly may possess them without my interference or my consent
4277,2007-132570-0053.flac,i could tell you that when once once my resolution is taken but i am talking to a baby let me howevever repeat that terrible as are that terrible as are that terrible as are the examples i could recite the recital could not now benefit you
4278,2007-132570-0024.flac,being because it i because it s because it is no business of mine to look gruff and fight battles emily endeavoured to correct the superstitious beweakness of annette though she could not entirely subdue her own to which the latter only replied
4279,2007-132570-0056.flac,quit my presence cried montoni this affect affect affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to to brave my indignation did you hedid you hedid you hear nothing signor said emily trembling and still unable to leave the room
4280,2007-132570-0058.flac,obey my order repeated montoni and for these fools tricks i will soon discover by whom whom they are practised emily again rose and exerted herself to herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her
4281,2007-132570-0030.flac,the ladies as they call themselves who the doves who doves who are lately come to udolfho why that signora livona that the signor brought to see my late lady at venice is his mistress now and was little better than i dare say and ludovico says
4282,2007-132570-0036.flac,because said he we don't go shares there this information heightened emily's impatience to know more and and anannette immediately departed on her inquiry the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations
4283,2007-132570-0050.flac,i could make you treme i tremble tremble at the bare recital he was interrupted by a groan which seemed to rise from underneath at the chamber they were in and as he threw a glance round it impatience and rage flashed from his eyes
4284,2007-132570-0031.flac,but pray be secret ma'am that his exlenza introduced her only to impose upon the world that upon the world that upon the world that had begun to make free with her character so when people saw my amy amy lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal
4285,2007-132570-0034.flac,but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name or that of monsieur valancourt now i think of it but now i think of it ma'amselle said annette i do i do believe there are prisoners for i overheard one of the signor's men yesterday
4286,2007-132570-0032.flac,but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady's death too
4287,2007-132570-0039.flac,i will condescend to advise where i may command
4288,2007-132570-0041.flac,i will have no more argument said montoni with a look that made her tremble what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby but i will be trifled with no longer
4289,2007-132570-0045.flac,replied emily that request would have proved reproved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right montoni turned pale with anger while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech
4290,2007-132570-0055.flac,leave the room instantly said he seeming not he seeming not to notice this strange occurrence without power to power to implore his pity she rose to go but found that she could not support r or r herself awe and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair
4291,2007-132570-0043.flac,and from from the vengeance he threatened but then the image of valancourt who so long had loved her and who was now perhaps so near  and near  near her came to her heart and together with the strong feelings nand from the indignation with which she had always
4292,2007-132570-0029.flac,were the same or if they were whether this was valancourt she however desired that annette would endeavor to learn whether were whether whether any prisoners were in wert in the castle and also their names oh dear ma'amselle said annette i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about
4293,2007-132570-0025.flac,nay ma'amselle you will believe nothing you are almost as bad as the signor himself who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret this was a hard
4294,2007-132570-0059.flac,but instead of but of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence pass to the ramparts as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement emily saw a party of montoni's troops winding down but own a distant mountain
4295,2007-132570-0028.flac,and he could be here in no other character how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart
4296,2007-132570-0046.flac,then all my vengeance falls upon upon upon you he exclaimed with an horrible oath and think not it shall be delayed
4297,2007-132570-0042.flac,let the recollection of your aunt's sufferings in consequence of her folly an obstinacy teach you a lesson sign the papers emily's resolution was for a moment awed she shrunk at the recollections he revived
4298,2007-132570-0016.flac,oh lord how glad i should be if it was so would you indeed be glad said emily in a tone of mournful reproach to be sure i should
4299,2007-132570-0003.flac,if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken signors
4300,2007-132570-0006.flac,no no says he i will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage and up the marble na marble marble staircase and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle for youlfor youl for you shall stay here annette you shall not go out of this room to night so
4301,2007-132570-0008.flac,yes he did indeed ma'amselle notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary
4302,2007-132570-0013.flac,interrupted emily quite wearied but wearied but wearied by this story do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice
4303,2007-132570-0019.flac,and then it was gone and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls so they helped one another up another up another up again as fast as they could you would not believe ma'amselle though though though i showed you the very canon where it used to appear
4304,2007-132570-0017.flac,ma'am replied annette and would not you be glad too to see signor valancourt i don't know any chevalier i like better madma like better ye like better i have a very great regard for the signor truly
4305,2007-132570-0018.flac,your regard for him cannot be doubted said emily since you wish emily since you wish emily since you wishd to see him a prisoner why no ma'amselle not a prisoner either but one must be glad to see him you know and it was only the other night i dreamt
4306,2007-132570-0015.flac,now i dare say you are thinking of monsieur valancourt and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state and that he has met with some of our people and is taking captive
4307,2007-132570-0002.flac,and fine trimmings boded no good i guessed what they were good god exclaimed exclaimed emily what will become of me
4308,2007-132570-0001.flac,and what is more not one of those fine ladies sober either and madies sober either i thought when i and saw them first that all those fine silks and fine veils why ma'amsell their veils were worked with silver
4309,2007-132570-0020.flac,and are you indeed so simple indeed so simple indeed so simple annette said emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories credit it these stories credit it these stories credit them ma'amselle why
4310,2007-132570-0004.flac,and across the great hall and and up the marble staircase and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle and i am in the corridor in a minute are you so says he and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way
4311,2007-132570-0009.flac,and he mistook ludovico's hall for old carlo's
4312,2007-132570-0005.flac,well says i if you think you think you think there is danger then go with me and guard me i guard me i guard me i am never afraid when you are by what says he when says he when i am scarcely recovered of one wound shall i put myself in the way of getting another
4313,2007-132570-0021.flac,all the world could not persuade me out of them raberto and sebastion and half a dozen more of them went into fits to be sure there was no occasion for that i said myself there was no need of that
4314,2007-132570-0010.flac,so we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room but the signor was as cunning as the best as the best of us and kept calling out at the door
4315,2007-132570-0012.flac,he was as same as could be and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a heat a heat a piece of meat in his basket all this i saw that he gogt that he ot tht he ot through the keyhole well annette said ludovico jeeringly shall i let you out now
4316,2007-132570-0011.flac,come forth my valorous signor steward just then old carloa opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand for as soon as the signor saw him
4317,2007-132570-0007.flac,well well said emily impatiently and anxious to inquire on another subject
4318,2007-132570-0000.flac,what were they are they disputing then said emily no ma'amselle not fighting elle not fighting but almost as good for i believe there was not one of the signor sober
4319,2007-132570-0022.flac,for says i when the enemy comes what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down in fits all of a row the enemy won't be so civil perhaps as to walk off like the ghost and leave them to help one another up
4320,2007-132570-0014.flac,but it is expected back to night or to morrow and i shall know then perhaps emily inquired if she but inquired if she but inquired if she ever heard the servants talk of prisoners ah ma'amselle said annette archly
4321,198-209-0009.flac,for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second
4322,198-209-0015.flac,to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeki toki king an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct
4323,198-209-0033.flac,as she pointed them out to her ashen ashen companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man
4324,198-209-0004.flac,and with a look which did not quite confirm his confirm his confirm his words said that he had he had he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt she felt she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home and too much offended to admit her
4325,198-209-0024.flac,perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father
4326,198-209-0035.flac,in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with with general tilney he is aitney he is aney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great a great a great regard for him i assure you
4327,198-209-0016.flac,or at least of its least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he he had hitherto sat but his father remained
4328,198-209-0023.flac,and dependence on catherine's honor oh do not say miss say miss say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted
4329,198-209-0011.flac,on the beginning of beginning of beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mister henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention
4330,198-209-0038.flac,lowering his voice well look boys well boys well done general said i i am quite of your mind
4331,198-209-0022.flac,i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world the world i with a world who could be i wouldi be  be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter i was sweeter sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sister's concern regret
4332,198-209-0003.flac,tripping lightly through the churchyard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number
4333,198-209-0008.flac,to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propropriety lead nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night
4334,198-209-0031.flac,was engaged in conversation with general tilney
4335,198-209-0019.flac,my dear you tumble my m my gown was missus allen's reply her assurance however standing sol assurance however standing sol as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance
4336,198-209-0037.flac,the odds were five to four against me and if i if iif i had not made one of the cleanest trokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew
4337,198-209-0021.flac,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of of such a thing but i begged mister thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as him as soon as ever i soon as ever i saw you now missus allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mister thorpe would only have stopped
4338,198-209-0017.flac,and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared
4339,198-209-0028.flac,nay iam sure by you sure by you look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time
4340,198-209-0013.flac,his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes
4341,198-209-0032.flac,what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mister thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry
4342,198-209-0006.flac,at the bottom of the street however she looked they looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgar's buildings
4343,198-209-0002.flac,and missus allen's wavering conviction only made it more doubtful to milsolm street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven
4344,198-209-0027.flac,why were you less generous than your sister if she why weger if she wedger if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be wat be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence me i take offence
4345,198-209-0025.flac,and he being hurried for time and at time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you
4346,198-209-0001.flac,catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilney's lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house
4347,198-209-0034.flac,when the entertainment was when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry wild beat object of his gallantry and while they waited in the la wilab wilabby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking
4348,198-209-0000.flac,missus allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney to day i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
4349,198-209-0029.flac,and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was a grer t was a grenvr it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as pa an and was pa and was possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box
4350,198-209-0018.flac,you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own vall was it missus allen did not they tell me that mister tilney and his sister weregone out in a phaatin together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you
4351,198-209-0020.flac,and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we we we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us s as a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
4352,198-209-0010.flac,to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared to plague or please her she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage
4353,198-209-0036.flac,know him him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again to day the moment he came into the billiard room one of the finest players we have by the bye and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first
4354,198-209-0005.flac,and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at e the the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there
4355,198-209-0012.flac,every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play
4356,198-209-0030.flac,she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other
4357,198-209-0007.flac,catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her a can her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be clasped by the laws of worldly politeness
4358,198-209-0014.flac,and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence
4359,198-209-0026.flac,and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information yet as something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mister tilney
4360,198-129977-0008.flac,the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber
4361,198-129977-0012.flac,has become a mere jargon everybody pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself
4362,198-129977-0027.flac,missus jennings enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she and that will tempt you miss marianne a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance who why yourselves and the carreys and the whittakers to be sure
4363,198-129977-0022.flac,that that that it was exactly the shade of her own edward's embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more ind still more nd still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely ecensured herself for what she had said
4364,198-129977-0023.flac,before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and missus jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest with the assistance of his mother in law sir john was not long in discovering
4365,198-129977-0009.flac,i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories gray moss and brushwood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
4366,198-129977-0017.flac,till a new object suddenly engaged her gaged her attention she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from missus dashwood his hand passed so directly directly to directly before her as to make a ring with a plateplate plate of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers
4367,198-129977-0011.flac,and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he and possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own own own and own it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery
4368,198-129977-0032.flac,hope i am sure you will like him
4369,198-129977-0016.flac,marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister
4370,198-129977-0001.flac,while his own enjoyment in it appeared o while n it appeared so while in it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring
4371,198-129977-0007.flac,which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiratiowhich whition as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country
4372,198-129977-0004.flac,as you are not yet ready for breakfast
4373,198-129977-0025.flac,but as it whatwas she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret's instruction extended sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening
4374,198-129977-0024.flac,that the name of ferrers began with an f and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing hat nothing that nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung
4375,198-129977-0026.flac,on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their other their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them both you must drink tea with us to night said he
4376,198-129977-0010.flac,iam afraid it is but too true said marianne true said marianne but why should you boast of it i suspect said elinor that to said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel
4377,198-129977-0013.flac,because i could find no language to describe them in describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all all sense and meaning i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you professed to fill
4378,198-129977-0002.flac,but hitherto the continuance hitherto the continuance hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had indimated the preceding one
4379,198-129977-0018.flac,but i should have thought her hair had been darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his
4380,198-129977-0015.flac,i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles an thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farmhouse than a watch tower
4381,198-129977-0003.flac,he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open
4382,198-129977-0031.flac,what d wha  do you mean shall i tell you certainly well then i guesse that what west that mister willoughby huns marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of h of hi of his manner and after a moment's silence said

4384,198-129977-0029.flac,and who is willoughby said he in a low low low low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting she gave him a brief reply
4385,198-129977-0021.flac,she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she ininternally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt
4386,198-129977-0014.flac,but in return your sister must allow me me me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing
4387,198-129977-0005.flac,this was a subject which insured marianne's attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes
4388,198-129977-0030.flac,edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of marianne's expressions as had puzzled ld d him before and when their visitors left them he he he he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
4389,198-129977-0019.flac,he colored very deeply and in in giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister's hair the the setting always casts a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise
4390,198-129977-0020.flac,that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself
4391,198-129977-0000.flac,elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction
4392,198-129977-0006.flac,when edward interrupted her by saying you mustwhen iti not inquire too far marianne remember when i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars
4393,198-126831-0013.flac,the poor man meant it aas a compliment but felicity who knew uncle blair wasn't an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasn't
4394,198-126831-0052.flac,i wouldn't have said the story girl honestly i thought it was a bell when i heard it and the door open too let us be fair felicity

4404,198-126831-0019.flac,i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward said the story girl dreamily and i think there is a way of getting there getting there getting there too if we culd only find it
4405,198-126831-0045.flac,uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door as he did so clear and sweet rang out ten bell like trimes
4406,198-126831-0020.flac,one bitter day when they seek it
4407,198-126831-0042.flac,i know he'll laugh at us awful but it's better to be laughed at than scared like this uncle roger did not come home till nearly ten never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in that lane
4408,198-126831-0033.flac,king's ghost whispered felix she never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the story girl oh oh children isn't there something under uncle alec's tree we peered fearfully through the gloom there was something something that wavered and fluttered advanced retreated
4409,198-126831-0032.flac,somebody killed or something like that you know nothing like that ever happened in our family the kings have always been respectable perhaps it is emily
4410,198-126831-0047.flac,and now it has almos aalmost and almost frightened your poor little monkeys to death we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn
4411,198-126831-0025.flac,you'd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them dropping them whenever a woman looked at him they say it's pitiful to see him i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl
4412,198-126831-0022.flac,they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country were we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles the world calls them its singers and poets and artists and story tellers

4414,198-126831-0024.flac,he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed the story girl kissed her finger tips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her
4415,198-126831-0006.flac,cecily how old must we be before we can have a real beau but sara always denied it so i am inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself patty distinguished himself by catching a rat
4416,198-126831-0023.flac,as we sat there the awkward man passed by with man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side he did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods
4417,198-126831-0046.flac,we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the the the explanation we thought he never would stop
4418,198-126831-0008.flac,very few cats have and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow anhe amount of it and thrive thereon patty had a finer taste the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking
4419,198-126831-0004.flac,chancing accidentally i vow to overhear certain of these secrets i learned that sara ray had named an apple for johnny price and cecily true as you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love
4420,198-126831-0036.flac,no it isn't peg nsn't peg sn't peg bowen it's something that walks i know a story about a ghost said the story girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes

4423,198-126831-0035.flac,there was not a great deal of comfort in this we were almost as much afraid of peg bowen as we would be of any spectral visiant peter scoffed at the idea peg bowen wasn't in the house before your uncle roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards he said
4424,198-126831-0014.flac,i'd like to side to side to side felicity but we'd come home tired and with all the milking to do you boys better go alone peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger you can all go

4427,198-126831-0021.flac,and that is the tragedy of life on that day the gates of of eden are shut behind them an age of gold is over henceforth they must dwell in the common light and af common day only a few who remain children at heart and heart and heart can ever find that fair lost path again
4428,198-126831-0018.flac,who pledged all comers in a golden cup who in a golden cup in a golden cup with jewels bright and if you drink of the cup with her said the story girl her eyes glowing through the who e who th emerald dusk about us who does who does you were never seen in the world again you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with the fairy bride
4429,198-126831-0048.flac,i was so frightened ie wouldn't mind if he'd laugh i wuld  mind if e'd laugh i would mind if he'd laugh once and have it done with it
4430,198-126831-0037.flac,don't cried cecily hysterically don't don't don't you go on don't you say another word i can't bear it don't you the story girl didn't but she had said enough
4431,198-126831-0053.flac,but it was over tobut it was over twas over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that a saucerful of piece
4432,198-126831-0015.flac,i have an idea that a raspberry pie for to morrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her
4433,198-126831-0007.flac,and being intolerably conceited about it until sara ray cured and array cured array cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears then pat sneaked abjectly off his till and off his tail drooping
4434,198-126831-0049.flac,i shall tell it too i don't care if the joke is as much has muh i'd as much on myself as any one a story is a story no matter who it's i i tory no matter who it's on but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown ups always do it i i never will when i'm grown up i'll remember better
4435,198-126831-0044.flac,there's no use asking there's asking asking the meaning of this i suppose said uncle roger with the calm of disthere's there's there spare i've gave up trying to fathom you young ones peter where's the key what yarn have you been telling
4436,198-126831-0038.flac,all at once something leaped from the bough of a tree and an alighted before us we split the air with a simultaneous shriek
4437,198-126831-0039.flac,he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps
4438,198-126831-0011.flac,felicity tried and hadhahad the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe a gorgeous compound
4439,198-126831-0041.flac,was white and clear against the dark background dark background dark background of spruces we were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew the family ghost only appears in daylight said the story girl
4440,198-126831-0031.flac,well here's the key go and see for yourself said peter felicity had no intention of going and seeing i think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex you ought to be braver than girls
4441,198-126831-0040.flac,he was a strange furtive animal a questing beast present he was he was a questing beast presently the moon rose but this only mad matters werhe was only mad matters werehe ws only mad matters worse the shadows had been still before now thehe wahow they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs the old house with its dreadful secret
4442,198-126831-0028.flac,and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights off to the west was a daffledule glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets
4443,198-126831-0012.flac,the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked aunt janet's and it'sthand it's thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse uncle roger ate three slizes of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist
4444,198-126831-0030.flac,there we stood in a huddled demoralized group oh what an tc demoralized group oh what an erie place that orchard was what shadows what noises
4445,198-126831-0043.flac,we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the and swarmed across the wheat and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door he stared at us in the moonlight
4446,198-126831-0017.flac,then we foregathered around around ound a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies and the story girl told us e tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glan where a fair white lady dwelt
4447,1963-147036-0017.flac,she got up to her feet at hand steadily and swayed toward him in a second he was by her side his arms about her she made made no resistance but rather he felt but rather he felt but rather he felt a yielding toward him which he had missed before her pale face was upturned to his and he stooped and kissed her
4448,1963-147036-0028.flac,he shrugged his shoulders you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which i was endeavoring to remove to a place of safety tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it i shall see the contents of this wallet to morrow he said

4450,1963-147036-0009.flac,he was tongue tied for a second because i love you he said and his voice shook it did did did not seem to him that he was talking the words came of their own volition he had no more intention of telling her he loved her indeed
4451,1963-147036-0022.flac,but the occasion is a desperate one and i cannot afford ord thord to stand on ceremony mister tarling tarling put the girl from him and looked at and looked at the smirking manager one comprehenenbuthnpensive glance the detective gave him
4452,1963-147036-0033.flac,here it was the girl's voice surprisingly clear and steady her shaking hands held held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it towards the detective there is a reason she said in a low voice
4453,1963-147036-0013.flac,was the second shock of the evening it was as though she though she had known it all along he was on his knees by her side and his arless arm was about her shoulders even before his brain had willed the act my girl my girl he said gently won't you please tell me
4454,1963-147036-0032.flac,tarling stepped back he saw the malicious little smile on milburgh's face and could have struck him down miss rider does not wish me to see what is in this case he said

4462,1963-147036-0034.flac,milburgh had gone too far tarling saw his face lengthen and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes then without further hesitation he opened the paper and read the first line took away his breath the confession of odette wrider
4463,1963-147036-0007.flac,she held out her hand and he hesitated  after all he had no right or title to this curious purse purse purse he compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it odette he said gently and walked round to her

4540,1963-142393-0053.flac,what was in her mind she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she wthat she looked what looked looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice but this second time she looked round

4542,1963-142393-0032.flac,when adam when adm adam came in sight of the grey town on the hillside and looked searchinglyy toward the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill wi wi the scene looked less harsh in the soft

4545,1963-142393-0046.flac,coming come from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill slowly adam thought but dinah but dinah but dinah was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step
4546,1963-142393-0052.flac,she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place dinah adam said again
4547,1963-142393-0044.flac,because it was away from all eyes no house no be house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep near no present but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky
4548,1963-142393-0016.flac,this morning brought with him newth thethoughts through the grey country thoughts which gave an altered significanceto its story of the past that is a base
4549,1963-142393-0048.flac,lest he should startle her too much yet he thought she's not one to be over startled she's always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill
4550,1963-142393-0022.flac,by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline an effulgent day the growth of higher feeling within us is her feeling within us is like the growth of faculty
4551,1963-142393-0004.flac,but towards the middle of october the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion the weeks were unusually long dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind
4552,1963-142393-0014.flac,he had he hd he had often been to oakburne and back since that first journey to snowfield but beyond oakburne oakburne the greystone walls the broken country the meagre trees seemed to be telling him afresh
4553,1963-142393-0033.flac,october sunshine than it had in it had in the eager time of early spring and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions
4554,1963-142393-0006.flac,but that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us adam was no longer so confident as he had been he began to fear that perhaps dinah's old life
4555,1963-142393-0051.flac,adam was glad glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him he came within three paces of her and then said dinah
4556,1963-142393-0026.flac,so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away his love for dinah was better and more precious to him for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow
4557,1963-142393-0005.flac,he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first drught that she offers him to care much about the taste of the second he to the second he treads the earth with a very elastic step as very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties
4558,1963-142393-0056.flac,my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you and this moment now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love i have a fullness of strength
4559,1963-142393-0000.flac,adam understood dinah's haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it
4560,1963-142393-0009.flac,and  thought he must write himself he must ask dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful he sat up late one night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect
4561,1963-142393-0030.flac,i've always always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me
4562,1963-142393-0024.flac,something like this sense of sense of sense of enlarged being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection recollection recollection of the past
4563,1963-142393-0013.flac,that he was already on his way to snowfield tha is way to snowfield its way to snowfield on horseback this time for his that his his hours were precious now and he had borrowed jonathan burge's good nag for burge's good nag for the burge's good nag for the journey what keen memories went along the road with him
4564,1963-142393-0050.flac,and adam rose from the and stone wall it happened that just as he walked forward dinah had paused and turned round to look back at the village
4565,1963-142393-0015.flac,the story of that painful past which he which he knew so well by heart but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time r rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters and adam
4566,1963-142393-0018.flac,adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank god for another's mismisery and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy in adam's behalf
4567,1963-142393-0043.flac,and seated himself on a loose stone against the low wall to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and widing up the hill he chose this spot almost at the top of the hill
4568,1963-142393-0017.flac,and selfish even a blasphemous spirit whichrejoices and is thankful over the past evil that is blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves
4569,1963-142393-0031.flac,when you can't look to them nearest to you when to them nearest to you to help you with a bit better thought
4570,1963-142393-0035.flac,as the delicate delicate delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him he seemed to see dinah's gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know
4571,1963-142393-0012.flac,she had not forbidden him to go she must surely expect that he would go before long by the second sunday in october
4572,1963-142393-0054.flac,what a look of yearning love it was that was that the mild gray eyes turned on the strong turned on the strong dark eyed man she did not start aaagain at the sight of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her round
4573,1963-142393-0038.flac,to preach in a cottage there as her habit was
4574,1963-142393-0007.flac,would have too strong a grasp upon her
4575,1926-147987-0031.flac,than from any experiences of his own his zest and debauchery might wane but never missus cutter's belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on
4576,1926-147987-0006.flac,antonia turned to me eagerly oh would you jim
4577,1926-147987-0012.flac,when i i when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to  to like to do anything about it i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hat rack lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep
4578,1926-147987-0028.flac,she had no choice but to go on to kansa's city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omaha hotel
4579,1926-147987-0027.flac,and that cutter must have hv av planned it so the conductor told her the black hawk train was due at waymore twelve minutes after the kansacenececity train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to black hawk without her
4580,1926-147987-0003.flac,or the way he looked at her i feel as if he's up to some of his tricks again
4581,1926-147987-0029.flac,but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible mister cutter will pay for this missus burden he will pay missus cutter avowed nodding her horse like head and rolling her eyes
4582,1926-147987-0022.flac,antonia was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told missus cutter it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then missus cutter told her story
4583,1926-147987-0010.flac,the man became insane he stood over me  choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse so this is what she's up is what she's up to when i'm away is it where is she you nasty welp

4592,1926-147987-0001.flac,she hesitated and then told us how strangely mister cutter had behaved before he went away
4593,1926-147987-0014.flac,and one eye was swollen and swollen swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have a doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her

4664,1926-143879-0025.flac,it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched watch the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews
4665,1926-143879-0019.flac,isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lily's understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides

4673,1926-143879-0021.flac,we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have affected in her native land
4674,1926-143879-0023.flac,but lily knew nothing of these discrimination of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sister's careers a strange anti climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabel's silence about mister osmond for instance
4675,1926-143879-0037.flac,she considered with a presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it
4676,1926-143879-0017.flac,which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another

4678,1926-143879-0020.flac,the trophies lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague the trovague but this was exactly what she had expect th trot the trod expect the trid expected of isabel to give it form and body
4679,1926-143879-0038.flac,an occasional lapse from candor in t candor in he an candor in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to anto to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception

4684,1926-143879-0034.flac,isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites
4685,1926-143879-0022.flac,than that she didn't wish to spea pa tespeak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in the secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice as she would have been to close that rare volume for ever
4686,1926-143879-0040.flac,advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend
4687,1926-143879-0031.flac,and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mister bantling that he would soon come over
4688,1926-143879-0039.flac,and there were several in her list of which which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain
4689,1926-143879-0045.flac,during which the fact of her being with his to his t his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone had gone to lodge made it virtually inefitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came
4690,1926-143879-0010.flac,she had left her husband behind her but had brought her children to whom isabel now played with equal munificence and tendernesnesnsness the part of maiden aunt mister ludlow

4695,1926-143879-0014.flac,and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made
4696,1926-143879-0035.flac,her character had revealed itself
4697,1926-143879-0015.flac,missus ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations
4698,1926-143879-0033.flac,but she added that she herself had always been consumed with a desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt
4699,1926-143879-0041.flac,but it stood for a high water mark in the remark in the abb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less
4700,1926-143879-0013.flac,and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped

4707,1926-143879-0002.flac,to social uses and there was that in her expression and attitude

4718,1867-154075-0018.flac,as if she were preparing herself for the explosion you don't have to put up your hands said ronicky doone wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer he had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance

4729,1867-154075-0032.flac,and he brushed a end he brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and co op aho and hol very well then it seems i've made an at an ass of myself but i'll try to make up for it now what about carolin

4733,1867-154075-0014.flac,you show him that it is possible

4742,1867-154075-0035.flac,this caroline smith may be a person of great value to me i have no doubt she is but i got a good argument
4743,1867-154075-0003.flac,and where did it lead right to this room ronicky stepped from among the smooth silks

4746,1867-154075-0010.flac,you smiled so so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here the only way he could get in was by stealth is that right
4747,1867-154075-0033.flac,leave this house and take a ride or a walk with me leave me as much as that if you have to talk to her ook to her why not do the talking here i don now replied ronicky doone i figure she'd think too much about you all the time

4749,1867-154075-0012.flac,my dear girl john bega ruth tolliver her voice shaking tush hhe broke in as smoothly as ever let me tell the story for you and spare you your blushes
4750,1867-154075-0038.flac,do you suppose i'll rest idle and let you walk away with her once we're outside of the house mark said ronicky doone i don't ask no favors let your men come on
4751,1867-154075-0031.flac,the perfect torture which had been wringing the soul of the man with the sneer projected through the lapd lau laughter i ask your pardon my dear said john mark to ruth i should have guessed you found him he confessed why he was here you took pity on him
4752,1867-154075-0005.flac,that's a likely story i can show you the tracks
4753,1867-154075-0002.flac,you followed his trail up the stairs to e to te to th to the kitchen and down the hall and up to harry's room e already knew he'd gone there but he left that room again and came down the hall yes
4754,1867-154071-0004.flac,go on back to sleep i'll call you again if anything happens
4755,1867-154071-0016.flac,she wore a black straw hat turned back from her face with a single big red flower at the side of it
4756,1867-154071-0008.flac,and he grew pale at the thought partner said ronicky doone  an er said ronicky doone if they are trying to keep her away from us they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days ain't that right
4757,1867-154071-0019.flac,ronicky ronicky ronicky doone followed that glance and he saw all hidden save a profile of the face
4758,1867-154071-0025.flac,what a contrast between the contrast between the contrast between he ascent and the descent he had literally flown down now his heel deels clumped out a slow and regular death march as he came back to the room when the room when the room when gregg opened the door
4759,1867-154071-0005.flac,ghost hours of the early morning they did not relax their vigil
4760,1867-154071-0022.flac,the girl hesitated a moment
4761,1867-154071-0007.flac,by this time the nerves of the two watchers were shattered swere shattered by the constant strain and the monotonous monotonous view from the front window was beginning to madden them it's proof that she ain't yonder said bill gregg
4762,1867-154071-0021.flac,the nose was hooked like the nose of a bird of prey the eyes were long and slanting like those of an oriental the face was thin almost fleshless so that the bony jaw stood out like the jawof a death's head
4763,1867-154071-0002.flac,here they took up the vigil
4764,1867-154071-0027.flac,now in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood he had lost lood he had lost her and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair
4765,1867-154071-0035.flac,not you bill you're going to buck up and and and go ahead full steam
4766,1867-154071-0030.flac,said bill gregg faintly now we hit the back trail and forget all sal said all about this he added with a faint attempt at said cynicism i've just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine that's all
4767,1867-154071-0041.flac,that sent out the girl with the exact exact that's exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and speak to her when you seen her bill what that girl told you didn't come out of her own head it come out of the head of the gen across the way when you turned your back on her
4768,1867-154071-0001.flac,found a big double room that ran across the whole length of the house from the back it looked down on the lights glimmering on the the black east river and across to the flare of brooklyn to the left the whole ark of the fifty ninth street bridge was exposed
4769,1867-154071-0012.flac,there stood caroline smith in the door of the the house she closed the door behind her and walking to the top of the steps paused there and looked up and down the street bill gregg groaned
4770,1867-154071-0017.flac,the the same distinction between their clothes was in their faces the finely modelled prettiness of her features tures tures and the big careless chiselling of the features of the features of the features of bill gregg ronicky doone did not wonder that after her first fear her gesture was one of disdain and surprise
4771,1867-154071-0010.flac,one week was decided on as a fair test if at the end of that time time time caroline smith did not come out of the house across the street they could conclude that she did not stay there
4772,1867-154071-0028.flac,after that he did not move ove so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply his legs were twisted awkwardly sprawling across the floor in front of him one long arm dragged down toward the floor
4773,1867-154071-0011.flac,peering through the slit between the drawn curtains which sheltered him from being observed at his spying when he called out softly the sound brought gregg with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window there could be no shadow of a doubt about it
4774,1867-154071-0029.flac,as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor as abor hardened hands his chin was fallen against his breast when ronic ronic ronicky doone crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his  shoulder he did not look up it's ended
4775,1867-154071-0044.flac,shake said ronicky doone that's the sort of talk i wanted to hear
4776,1867-154071-0043.flac,you got to get that gent i seen grinning from the you got the window grinning asked bill gregg grinding his teeth and starting from his hose chair was the skunk laughing at me sure every minute bill gregg groaned i'll smash every bone in his ugly head
4777,1867-154071-0037.flac,d'you know what she said well bill gregg she dde well bill gregg she says i don't remember any d'any any such name that took the wind out of me i only had enough left to say
4778,1867-154071-0014.flac,and so swift was that descent that when the girl idling down the steps across the street came on to the te sidewalk bill gregg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her
4779,1867-154071-0031.flac,said ronicky doone doone doone bill look me in the eye and tell me man to man that you're a liar he added can you ever b can you ever b can you ever be happy without her man the cruelty of that speech made gregg flush
4780,1867-154071-0000.flac,chapter eight two apparitions
4781,1867-154071-0023.flac,for she made a slight he made a slight outward gesture with one hand if this were in her mind however it vanished instantly she she turned with a shudder and hurried away down the street
4782,1867-154071-0036.flac,bill gregg smiled sourly
4783,1867-154071-0013.flac,snatched his hat and plunged through the door and ronicky heard the brief thunder of his strof his strof his feet down the first flight of stairs then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing
4784,1867-154071-0042.flac,she looked like she'd run after you and try to explain but the fear of that fellow up in the window was too much for her and she didn't dare bill
4785,1867-154071-0015.flac,for never had the miner seemed so clumsily big and gaunt never had his clothes seemed so unpressed and shapeless while his soft gray hat to which he still clung religiously appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast to the slim prettiness of the girl
4786,1867-154071-0026.flac,ronicky doone blinked and drew in a deep breath at the sight of the poor poor fellow's face gregg had known before that he truly loved rly loved really loved this girl whom he had never seen
4787,1867-154071-0032.flac,said gregg huskily ain't he ain't there that's where you and me don't agree
4788,1867-154071-0009.flac,it's just about our last chance bill we've done our hunting pretty are hunting pretty are hunting pretty near as well as we could if we don't land her this this trip i'm about ready to give up
4789,1867-154071-0039.flac,and then she looks back over her shoulder as much much as to wish she was safe back in her house do you know why she looked back back over her shoulder just for the reason i told you no bill here was a gent standing up there at the window watching her and how she acted
4790,1867-154071-0020.flac,what a face it was never in his life had ronic e doone seen a man who in one instant filled him iinstant filled him witinstant filled him with such fear and hatred such loathing and such red such loathing and such dread such scorn and such terror
4791,1867-154071-0038.flac,the gent that was writing driting those papers to the correspondence school to you from the west the one you sent your you're youre picture to and sent my picture to she says and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet you're mad she says
4792,1867-154071-0006.flac,apparently the place was a harm harmless rooming house of fairly good quality not a sign of caroline smith appeared even during the second day
4793,1867-154071-0040.flac,he's the one who's kept her in that house
4794,1867-154071-0018.flac,he went a long slow step closer to her with both his hands outstretched
4795,1867-154071-0034.flac,ain't that something done after you've done all that
4796,1867-154071-0033.flac,look at the way things have gone you start out with the photograph of a girl now we've followed her found her name
4797,1867-154071-0003.flac,bill gregg shook his head that's not the one unbin she's all different a pile different ronicky ronicky sighed
4798,1867-154071-0024.flac,as for bill gregg he bore himself straight as bus buses soldier and came back across the pavement but it was the erectness of a soldier who had met with a crushing defeat and only preserves an feat and only preserves an feat and only preserves an outward resolution while all the spirit within is crushed
4799,1867-148436-0026.flac,the brute has gone lame you see
4800,1867-148436-0020.flac,and set about frying ham and making coffee this with crackers formed the meal he watched nash eat for a moment of solemn silence and then the foreman looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster let me in on the joke son nothin
4801,1867-148436-0010.flac,what you say cuts both ways steve this feller bard
4802,1867-148436-0009.flac,and you set over em like a hen and like a hen they look like eggs they feel like eggs but they don't never hath that's the way with your ideas they look all right they sound all right but they don'tand thy donthey don't mean nothin so long
4803,1867-148436-0013.flac,he was weary like his horse horse horse and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed he let the pony go on at the same tireless jog clinging like a bull dog to the trail about midday
4804,1867-148436-0045.flac,but the point is i didn't see it d'you mind if i turn if i turn in on that bunk over there help yorself said the boy what time d'you want me to wake you up never mind i wake up automatic so long bud

4807,1867-148436-0042.flac,and his lips twisted back the same smile he had an had an had when he got into the saddle but pretty soon i s'pose jo an soon i s'pose jo had a chance to figure out that it didn't do him no particular harm to be alone the minute he seen that he stopped fightin
4808,1867-148436-0014.flac,hello young feller un feller lo stranger what's the chance of bunkin here for three or four hours and gettin a good feed for the how poss never better gim me the hoss
4809,1867-148436-0023.flac,he was a sure enough tenderfoot tenderfoot leastwise he looked it and he talked it but he wasn't the familiarity of this hit the familiarity of this hint the famliarity of this description made steve set up a trifle straighter was he dear dear ringer maybe i dunno
4810,1867-148436-0018.flac,the boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw colored hair seemed positively white maybe you want to pay me he suggested fiercely maybe you think we're squatters at run a hotel
4811,1867-148436-0004.flac,bard who's he logan considered the other with with with a sardonic smile
4812,1867-148436-0037.flac,ah twtwtwtwenty five dollars is enough says pa all right says the tenderfoot here's the money an he counts it out an paw's s hand he says what a little little beauty it would be a treat to see him work on a polo field pa says
4813,1867-148436-0031.flac,when he seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself
4814,1867-148436-0044.flac,there wouldn't be no drawin card to get the boys round the they're on the there in the house no more but you're lookin sort o sleepy stranger i am them answered nash well if you'd seen that show you wouldn't be thinkin o sleep not for some time maybe not

4816,1867-148436-0019.flac,recognizing the true western breed even in breed even in breed even in this small edition nash grinned speakin man to man son i didn't think didn't think didn't think that but i thought i'd sort of sort of sort o feel my way which i'll say you're lucky you didn't try to feel your way with pa

4819,1867-148436-0027.flac,and i won't ask much cash to boot i begin wonderin what pa was drivin at but i didn't say nothin jest held myself together an waited look over there to the corral says pa and pointed
4820,1867-148436-0038.flac,then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the gri tha grin off my face down goes the tenderfoot and takes his saddle and flops it on the piebald pinto and the piebald was jest as nice as milk then he leads him out o the corral and gets on
4821,1867-148436-0001.flac,and were the slopes pitched sharply down it wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot certainly the choice and certainly the choice ertainly the choice of nash and of nshof nash was well made and eastern horse of blood over a level course
4822,1867-148436-0028.flac,it's the best hoss i've everer had it was the best horse paw ever had too it was a piebald pinto called j j jo after my cousin josiah who's jest a plain badden and it badden and raises hell when there's any excuse the piebald
4823,1867-148436-0022.flac,nash sipped his d hed his coffee and waited on the mountain desert one does not draw out a narrator with questions
4824,1867-148436-0039.flac,but he didn't see none then the circus started an b'liek bliek b'liek b'lieve me it me it was some circus jo hadn't had much action for some time
4825,1867-148436-0029.flac,he didn't even need an excuse you see
4826,1867-148436-0007.flac,then he hinted around about learnin the way to eldara because he knows that town is pretty close to drew's place i guess i told him sure i did he should a gone due west but i sent him south there is a south trail
4827,1867-148436-0034.flac,and the end was the rider lying on the ground whenever the boys round here here wanted any excitement they used to come over and try their hands with jo
4828,1867-148436-0015.flac,feed him grain no you won't put him up i'll tend to that looks like a badun that's it
4829,1867-148436-0003.flac,i s'pose you're here askin after bard
4830,1867-148436-0030.flac,when he leaves the corral he likes to have another hoss for a runnin mate and he was jest as tame as anything i could ride him anybody could ride him but if you take him outside the bars of the corral without company first thing he done
4831,1867-148436-0002.flac,but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail dawn came while they wound over the crest of the ridge and wwiwith the sun in their faces they took the downgrade it was well into the morning before nash before nash reached logan
4832,1867-148436-0032.flac,which joe can raise more hell for his size than any hos s in any hosis in any hoss i ever seen he's what you call anedicated bucker he don't fool around with no ground with no pauses he jest starts in an figers out a situation
4833,1867-148436-0036.flac,well this tenderfoot he looks over the hoss in the corral and says
4834,1867-148436-0041.flac,which maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performin because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle he was and he never pulled leather no sir he never touched the buckin strap but jest sat there with his teeth set
4835,1867-148436-0021.flac,i was jus jest thinkin of pa what's he sore about come out short at poker lately no he lost a hoss ha ha ha he explained
4836,1867-148436-0043.flac,and started off at a gallop the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go we  was over there damn my eye says pa
4837,1867-148436-0016.flac,unsaddled him him and gave him a small feed the horse first rolled on strolled on strolled on the dirt floor and then started methodically on his fodder having made surer that his mount was not off his feed nash rolled a cigarette and strolled back to the house with the boy
4838,1867-148436-0040.flac,thinkin up new ways of raising hell
4839,1867-148436-0025.flac,the boy paused to remember and then with twink twink twinkling eyes he mimicked that's very good of good of good of you sir but i'll only stop to make a trade with you this horse and some cash cashcash to boot for a durable mount out of your corral
4840,1867-148436-0012.flac,his eastern course nash pursued for a mile or more
4841,1867-148436-0011.flac,he sounds like a tender tender he tenderfoot but he ain't a tenderfoot feeling that this parting shot gave him the honors o the meeting he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs overhearing stood still and gazed at his master
4842,1867-148436-0000.flac,chapter twelve the first day a a mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog
4843,1867-148436-0024.flac,pa meets him at the door and asks him in
4844,1867-148436-0035.flac,and tame down the bruises after jo laid em cold on the ground
4845,1743-142914-0003.flac,bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground ground with soft in places quite muddy peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly
4846,1743-142914-0022.flac,i think there is one right under my feet e he it now watch me get him longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this
4847,1743-142914-0027.flac,every few steps he would stop to stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a sea saw
4848,1743-142914-0016.flac,for the first time time te time peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes exclaimed peter
4849,1743-142914-0000.flac,he wasn'he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing ing hing elting else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with he he wit a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go
4850,1743-142914-0010.flac,certainly i'll excuse you replied excuse you replied excuse you replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be that longbill was making such a good meal of but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat the eat the eat there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground
4851,1743-142914-0017.flac,and was there a worm in every one asked peter his his eyes very wide with interest longbill nodded
4852,1743-142914-0026.flac,there was a little pebbly beach running along the thethan the the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long sslender bill their bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black
4853,1743-142914-0029.flac,before peter could say another word teter came running towards him and d him and him and it was plain to see plain to see plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something don't move peter rabbit don't move he cried why not demanded not demanded not demanded peter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move
4854,1743-142914-0004.flac,from right under his very nose something knows something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he he ehe stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head
4855,1743-142914-0008.flac,i recognized you just as as as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger
4856,1743-142914-0006.flac,he scared me for a second then you 're even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but longbill didn't peter turned quickly there was missus woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass
4857,1743-142914-0031.flac,missus teeter stood up and stepped aside then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with wih wth with just a few bits of grass for a lining four white eggs with big dark blotches on them
4858,1743-142914-0011.flac,longbill took two or lon longer three steps in rather a stately fashion peter  had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow
4859,1743-142914-0007.flac,i didn't mean to scare him apologized peter i reali rea really didn't mean to do you think he was really very much scared
4860,1743-142914-0009.flac,i'm glad it is no one but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it you'll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites
4861,1743-142914-0033.flac,it suddenly struck peter that if if he hadn't seen her do it he wouldn't have known she was there
4862,1743-142914-0013.flac,his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while hound black and buff while hound black and buff while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it wsit was his head that made him look queer
4863,1743-142914-0019.flac,while these worms were sc uwhile so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there
4864,1743-142914-0001.flac,i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was one of the first birds to arrive and i've neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time
4865,1743-142914-0028.flac,it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peter's peter greeted him joyously
4866,1743-142914-0023.flac,that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes it all it's wonderful sighed peter i don't suppose anyone that suppose anyone suppose anyone else can find hidden worms that way that way my cousin jack snipe can replied longbill promptly
4867,1743-142914-0014.flac,his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly longbill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length
4868,1743-142914-0005.flac,he had had had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled
4869,1743-142914-0021.flac,longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him m mhm and to peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all that's the way i get them said he
4870,1743-142914-0030.flac,just then then then missus teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter sstill bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start
4871,1743-142914-0012.flac,he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up
4872,1743-142914-0020.flac,and how is it possible for you to possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in asked peter longbill chuckled
4873,1743-142914-0034.flac,my he exclaimed i certainly would have stepped stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me said he i'm so thankful i didn't i don't see how you dared lay them in the open like this
4874,1743-142914-0025.flac,now i must be running along i'm ever ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance toa get so peter said good bye and kept on down the laughing brook to the brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool
4875,1743-142914-0002.flac,off he start otr otar tarted lipperty lipperty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows
4876,1743-142914-0024.flac,he feeds the same way i do only he likes marsshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps perhaps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before
4877,1743-142914-0032.flac,they looked so much like the surrounding pebbles that that he never would have seen them in the world but for missus missus teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps missus teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably
4878,1743-142914-0018.flac,peter remembered how he had  watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface
4879,1743-142914-0015.flac,then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of tthe limpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole
4880,1743-142913-0018.flac,in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite as surprised as he felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious know exclaimed jenny wren
4881,1743-142913-0019.flac,where are your eyes peter did you ever see a flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didn't wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look
4882,1743-142913-0013.flac,it it it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mister sun had kicked his bedclothes off
4883,1743-142913-0017.flac,and they certainly have good sense in choosing and choosing choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugh by the way where does anteris cresty build asked peter
4884,1743-142913-0008.flac,that is something i i don't often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call why do folks call why do folks call you wood peewee peewee chuckled happily
4885,1743-142913-0030.flac,one is all i can take all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mister wren work all day carrying carrying carrying sticks and straws into a hole an another tree it seean seeseeiseems to me that he is carried enough in there to build two or three nests
4886,1743-142913-0015.flac,then as peter shook his head shook his hea shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply cresty and his wife always insist upon having upon having a piece of snake skin and h snakeskin and te snake skin in their nest said she why they want it goodness knows but
4887,1743-142913-0007.flac,but no one could ever mistake peewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over aren't you here early asked peter peewee nodded
4888,1743-142913-0010.flac,come as often as you like replied pewee the oftener the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the flycatcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him
4889,1743-142913-0005.flac,but he wasn't sad as peter peter peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger  er than his cousin chebek but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail
4890,1743-142913-0024.flac,i've noticed that he is is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny wren nodded yank yank the nuthatch uses an old house i'm told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she
4891,1743-142913-0023.flac,winsome bluebirds stupid snapped jenny snapped jenny wren peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and ssskimmer the tree swallow added jenny that's so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter
4892,1743-142913-0011.flac,that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take that mother nature take care of her trees and othr other growing things which insects so dearly loved to destroy
4893,1743-142913-0006.flac,the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing two whitish bars and the bars and the bars and he noticed that peewee's wings were longer than his tail which wasn't the the the case with chebec
4894,1743-142913-0026.flac,then there are killy the sparrow theyre killy the sparrow are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl thel thell peter looked surprised i didn't suppose they nested in holes in trees he exclaimed they certainly do more's the pity snapped jenny
4895,1743-142913-0003.flac,it didn't take peter long to find peewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw peewee fly out and make the same kind of little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies
4896,1743-142913-0025.flac,tommy tit the chickadee sometimes uses an old house then   again he and missus chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one
4897,1743-142913-0009.flac,it is so quiet and restful so quiet and restful that i love it missus pwee and i are very retiring we do not not like too many near neighbours you won't mind if i come to see you once in in a while will you asked peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch
4898,1743-142913-0016.flac,perhaps they think it will scare robbers awy robbers of robbers away as for me i should have a cold i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that cresty and his wife are a handsome couple
4899,1743-142913-0022.flac,the older it is the better the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is e said before is a very good thing for the rest of us
4900,1743-142913-0028.flac,spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine i've talked quite enough for one morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him
4901,1743-142913-0012.flac,but most of all peter thought about that queer request of cresty's and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mister blacksnake
4902,1743-142913-0027.flac,it would be a good thing for the rest of us if they didn't hast at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them killy always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year
4903,1743-142913-0029.flac,jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well  well what is it now she demanded have you got two homes asked peter good gracious no exclaimed jenny
4904,1743-142913-0014.flac,jenny wren was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way an that way in that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded
4905,1743-142913-0020.flac,there is downy the woodpecker the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute that's good i like to see that it it it means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the old orch their old orch the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses
4906,1743-142913-0021.flac,i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in
4907,1743-142913-0004.flac,it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone peewee pee wee pee wee
4908,1743-142913-0002.flac,he usually is one of he is one of the last of the flycatcher family to arrive i didn't expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early
4909,1743-142913-0000.flac,with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old briar patch on his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard
4910,1743-142913-0001.flac,he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying pee wee pee wee pee wee peter chuckled happily
4911,1743-142912-0005.flac,and this way and that hat hat hat way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw
4912,1743-142912-0001.flac,he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousisins of chebecs did yu did you did you say your fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way that is what i said replied chebec he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know
4913,1743-142912-0010.flac,scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of sbranch of branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing
4914,1743-142912-0019.flac,but if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrapper's bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught the fly and it had tasted good
4915,1743-142912-0024.flac,it was cresty the great crested flycatcher he was a great crested flycatcher he a great crested flycatcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird yet the kingbird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender
4916,1743-142912-0015.flac,there wouldn't be any honey if i did
4917,1743-142912-0007.flac,he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was
4918,1743-142912-0023.flac,every way but the right way look up over your head cried the your head cried the your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice
4919,1743-142912-0004.flac,of course peter couldn't be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him
4920,1743-142912-0030.flac,he just couldn't understand about those cast off suits poff suits poff suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny wren could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered lipperty lipperty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home
4921,1743-142912-0018.flac,there's a fly way over there beyond the old apapple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying st any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldn't have seen it had been only one fourth that distance away
4922,1743-142912-0016.flac,those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know no no the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that don't
4923,1743-142912-0032.flac,this time jenny jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didn't   i n i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping
4924,1743-142912-0036.flac,he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors
4925,1743-142912-0033.flac,didn't i peter rabbit didn't i dt i didn't i you certainly did jenny you certainly didn't t certainly certainly did and i'm sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing but i just didn't know who else to go to
4926,1743-142912-0028.flac,a what stammered peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied cresty somewhat impatiently now don't forget peter i've got to go house hunting but you'll find me there or hereabouts if it happens that you find one of those
4927,1743-142912-0020.flac,are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper or i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him
4928,1743-142912-0000.flac,and now our family is very well represented in the old orch orch and orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scscratched his long right ear
4929,1743-142912-0026.flac,you seem to be in a hurry so don't let me detain you peter said cresty said cresty before peter could find his tongue i just i just want to ask one little favor of you what is it asked peter who
4930,1743-142912-0002.flac,the rest of us always feel safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now
4931,1743-142912-0017.flac,i am one of farmer brown's best friends if he he did but know it you can talk all talk all talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any one of them has better eyessight than i have i'd like to know who it is
4932,1743-142912-0034.flac,go to for what snapped jenny wren what is it you've come to me for snakeskins replied peter snake skins snakeskins shrieked jenny wren
4933,1743-142912-0027.flac,if in youre roaming about you run across an old ld old cast off suit of mister black of mister black of mister blacksnake or any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said cresty  a
4934,1743-142912-0011.flac,peter couldn't help but it might but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the fly catchers there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill
4935,1743-142912-0031.flac,jenny called ppeter jenny wren jenny wren no one answered him he could hear mister he could hear mister wren singing in another tree but he couldn't see him jenny jenny wren jenny wren called peter again
4936,1743-142912-0012.flac,scrapper's slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air
4937,1743-142912-0006.flac,a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat
4938,1743-142912-0021.flac,turning away toward towardsward ward the green meadows instead peter didn't wait for scrapper to return
4939,1743-142912-0022.flac,just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard some one called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way
4940,1743-142912-0014.flac,it reminded peter that he had often herd scrapper called the bee martin and now and now and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter
4941,1743-142912-0025.flac,his throat and breast were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking
4942,1743-142912-0029.flac,cast off snake suits before peter peter peterpeter could say another word cresty had flown away away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch and then towards jenny wren's house
4943,1743-142912-0008.flac,he wasn't afraid and he intended that everybody he should know it especially redtail it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling redtail a robber and every other bad name he could think of
4944,1743-142912-0003.flac,at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old  the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices
4945,1743-142912-0035.flac,you don't understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to want to want to know is why ii i should cresty the fly catch or ask me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family
4946,1743-142912-0009.flac,all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him an attacking big redtail when tail when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him
4947,1743-142912-0013.flac,and his bill and bill bill snapped in quite the same way chebeks did when he caught a fly but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up
4948,1502-122619-0090.flac,with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father
4949,1502-122619-0001.flac,could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks
4950,1502-122619-0051.flac,he will see no change it is it s it is true my young men did not go about on the war path they had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white chief
4951,1502-122619-0092.flac,and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverenty on their heads seeming to entreat his blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person
4952,1502-122619-0006.flac,on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of e settlement of the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst tat suddenly burst at suddenly burst upon a busy people
4953,1502-122619-0084.flac,was whispered from mouth to mouth magua had often heard that wa was the the fame of this wise and just delaware
4954,1502-122619-0070.flac,standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious and perhaps injudicios and perhaps injudicious discussion
4955,1502-122619-0035.flac,but the yengeese have long arms and legs that never tire
4956,1502-122619-0069.flac,its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls
4957,1502-122619-0056.flac,a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in
4958,1502-122619-0021.flac,leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short and frugal repast that followed
4959,1502-122619-0026.flac,the tomahawks of your young men men men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yankees are dead and the delawares are our neighbors
4960,1502-122619-0023.flac,notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware
4961,1502-122619-0032.flac,good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time
4962,1502-122619-0004.flac,that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection and now rendered them werererereluctant to encounter their former masters as for the tribe its as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity
4963,1502-122619-0028.flac,does my prisoner give trouble   to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons between the hurons beween the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open let her be sent to my squa if she gives trouble to my brother
4964,1502-122619-0073.flac,that always preceded a conference but no sign of impatience or that of uthat of surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally an eye was raised from raised from raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
4965,1502-122619-0086.flac,the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out of a little from the throng
4966,1502-122619-0039.flac,compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the comof the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the conficult for the doner immediately to read the effect of a generosity
4967,1502-122619-0047.flac,and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee
4968,1502-122619-0019.flac,he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his alarm and taking the other by the wrist then once more exchanged friendly salutations
4969,1502-122619-0003.flac,in various ways it was he prevalent opinion however
4970,1502-122619-0085.flac,with the great spirit and which has since transmitted his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his ancient territory

5103,1334-135589-0040.flac,now edward who do you think was is here to day the reigning bell and the the the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
5104,1334-135589-0054.flac,recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
5105,1334-135589-0006.flac,you are here highly spoken of said the prince for so young a man man so you were at the affair of worcester we will retain you for your services will be wanted by and by
5106,1334-135589-0078.flac,when he entered the room he ft the room he fet the room he found himself in the arms of humphrey who had arrived with the messenger after the greek greetings were over edward said alice and i have seen patience and i i fear i must surrender at discretion
5107,1334-135589-0048.flac,but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
5108,1334-135589-0063.flac,but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
5109,1334-135589-0016.flac,and the contents removed a heavy load from edwards edwards edward's mind but he now thought of nothing but war and although he and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved resolved resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
5110,1334-135589-0044.flac,and i understand is a very princely mansion humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mister heatherstone does it not replied edward
5111,1334-135589-0020.flac,and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands turenne bore down conde who had gained every who had gained every who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
5112,1334-135589-0036.flac,alice and edith rose rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
5113,1334-135589-0079.flac,mister heatherstone may make his own term make his own terms i must wave all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i have seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife
5114,1334-135589-0015.flac,and not receiving the assistance he he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his to his to his departure from paris edward had received humphrey's letter explaining away the intendant's conduct
5115,1334-135589-0005.flac,conde is just nw now now now released from vincen's but depend upon upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessarsssary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of conde
5116,1334-135589-0019.flac,and edward with his friends fouleed his fortunes and gained his good willl they were rapidly promoted time flew on and in the year sixteen fifty four the court of france concluded an alliance with cromwell
5117,1334-135589-0010.flac,said the prince prince inprince in securing the services of such fine young men you will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service and then follow me to guienne to which province i am now about to depart
5118,1334-135589-0076.flac,i trust that the daughter will wll will often grace our court patience made nomade no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
5119,1334-135589-0075.flac,and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her her her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
5120,1334-135589-0035.flac,although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
5121,1334-135589-0064.flac,even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the even the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward
5122,1334-135589-0061.flac,and now let me give you some advice for your friends master chaloner and grenville that much of their properperty has been taken away by and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
5123,1334-135589-0072.flac,but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect but amperfect nd perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at ut the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
5124,1334-135589-0090.flac,replied edith redith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all al your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
5125,1334-135589-0023.flac,after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
5126,1334-135589-0012.flac,and had been reinforced by troops from spain set up the standard of revolt edward and his friends joined them with about three hundred english and scotchmen which they had enlisted and very soon afterwards
5127,1334-135589-0062.flac,those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
5128,1334-135589-0021.flac,made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
5129,1334-135589-0058.flac,you were who were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey as to humphrey who has all long been acting as his factotum in the business and recollect at the time that mister heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion
5130,1334-135589-0030.flac,they are thy sisters alice and edith
5131,1334-135589-0024.flac,and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and everything was ready for the restoration
5132,1334-135589-0007.flac,can you procure any of your countrymen i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for any more
5133,1334-135589-0080.flac,let her father but give me her and arnwood arnwood arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are
5134,1334-135589-0038.flac,and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conningham and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
5135,1334-135589-0000.flac,chapter twenty seven but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army
5136,1334-135589-0085.flac,it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
5137,1334-135589-0087.flac,and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
5138,1334-135589-0082.flac,has fully acted up to what he stated where his were h were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property he has indeed replied edward as for his daughter edward you have yet to win her and wear her
5139,1334-135589-0074.flac,and the proportion of the whole figure a whole figure the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind  n agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the toast of the toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance
5140,1334-135589-0029.flac,at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize themtemthem indeed i do not are they any of our parish beauties
5141,1334-135589-0052.flac,he cannot refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king king king or his counsil will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
5142,1334-135589-0066.flac,that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had despatched a messenger with the letter
5143,1334-135589-0059.flac,what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us
5144,1334-135589-0067.flac,but the messenger had not yet returned
5145,1334-135589-0050.flac,you will not accept them they must be divided you will and hand it over to you in too said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not youe not not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you cannot blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone
5146,1334-135589-0014.flac,and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of saint antoine in which neither party had the advantage
5147,1334-135589-0081.flac,they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone
5148,1334-135589-0089.flac,to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argue upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
5149,1334-135589-0026.flac,was met at dover by general by general monk and conducted to london which he g g entered amid the acclamations of the people on the twenty ninth of the same month we  a month we a month we may leave the reader to suppose that edward
5150,1334-135589-0068.flac,on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
5151,1334-135589-0056.flac,at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first s first but my dear sister it appears to sister it appears to sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
5152,1334-135589-0055.flac,and the king's obligations to to to to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty
5153,1334-135589-0041.flac,no less than one with whom you were formally well acquainted edward patience heatherstone patience heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
5154,1334-135589-0011.flac,and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be be required a month after this interview conde who had been joined by a great number of nobles
5155,1334-135589-0053.flac,which has been so long held by others
5156,1334-135589-0045.flac,how can you ou say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but  but  but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity
5157,1334-135589-0043.flac,with her to day when did you hear her from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now all to ether with other indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
5158,1334-135589-0032.flac,will they will they they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
5159,1334-135589-0004.flac,i will give you letters to conde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong that is not your affair
5160,1334-135589-0022.flac,edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
5161,1334-135589-0060.flac,and i therefore say again my dear yer yr yer edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstone's intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it be guided by it replied edward
5162,1334-135589-0046.flac,what is your perplexity well replied edward since it is to be so let us sit down and talk over the matter i acknowledge the kindness of mister heatherstone
5163,1334-135589-0070.flac,mister heatherstone who let his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
5164,1334-135589-0042.flac,i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
5165,1334-135589-0018.flac,except in inquiring after her after her after her health and sending his respects it may be years beebebefore i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
5166,1334-135589-0049.flac,although not said it is expected that all all did that did that she is to be included in the transfer and i i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot
5167,1334-135589-0069.flac,and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chalonet of his sisters chalont of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
5168,1334-135589-0017.flac,he wrote a a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
5169,1334-135589-0013.flac,conde obtained the victory at blenan and in april sixteen fifty two advanced to to to comte to paris turenne who had taken comt who had taken who had taken the command of the french army followed him
5170,1334-135589-0025.flac,on the fifteenth of may sixteen sixty the news arrived was arrived was arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king sailed from cheveling
5171,1334-135589-0086.flac,and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the ima image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that tathat is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
5172,1334-135589-0084.flac,but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away
5173,1334-135589-0034.flac,well chaloner to all appearance your good aunts have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
5174,1334-135589-0057.flac,why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrnot going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
5175,1334-135589-0033.flac,for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
5176,1334-135589-0031.flac,it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles iam sure it is them yes replied grenville
5177,1334-135589-0088.flac,you know humphrey humphy humphy how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
5178,1334-135589-0065.flac,and make the arrangements that is an advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader
5179,1334-135589-0083.flac,as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you
5180,1334-135589-0039.flac,which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such a which accomplished an elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
5181,1334-135589-0002.flac,and turen i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon that will be any the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players which would your majesty recommend me to follow inquired edward
5182,1334-135589-0037.flac,the king rose in his stirrups and and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
5183,1334-135589-0047.flac,and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still still still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
5184,1088-134318-0009.flac,bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tessellated hallway
5185,1088-134318-0007.flac,kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why miles why of course tell him to come p come up come up come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
5186,1088-134318-0001.flac,it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty ers to a dirty hers to a dirty little peasants cabin on the hillside out out outside durazo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kara's whim all that life held for a man
5187,1088-134318-0015.flac,fisher closed the door bebehind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
5188,1088-134318-0017.flac,and fisher standing at the standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitors so genial i suppose your cheque will be honored all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a litte little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
5189,1088-134318-0002.flac,to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
5190,1088-134318-0016.flac,no more  patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
5191,1088-134318-0014.flac,he pushed open shed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
5192,1088-134318-0010.flac,muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a m a a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher at the unoffending fisher at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
5193,1088-134318-0004.flac,he rim grim rim remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
5194,1088-134318-0006.flac,had t x returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied t x and dalayed his suspicions
5195,1088-134318-0018.flac,damn all greeks he said greeks he said greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being being being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust to greek he said
5196,1088-134318-0003.flac,to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
5197,1088-134318-0000.flac,chapter twelve cara lay blaybyblay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face  his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
5198,1088-134318-0012.flac,yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and s t t the startled fisher drew back back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor
5199,1088-134318-0013.flac,then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this stairs this stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
5200,1088-134318-0005.flac,he he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pazara and
5201,1088-134318-0021.flac,until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
5202,1088-134318-0019.flac,always get your money in advance all anvance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher buter but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you on't you believe it my poor man said the other you
5203,1088-134318-0011.flac,yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
5204,1088-134318-0008.flac,yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock
5205,1088-134318-0020.flac,at that that that that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visivisvisivisitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
5206,1088-134315-0021.flac,he will probably be interested if you take take take him into the library very good sir said the urbane fisher will you change before you where you where you go out kara shook his head i think head i think head i think i will go as i am he said get me my fur coat this beastly cold kills me
5207,1088-134315-0018.flac,to refuse the favors of remington kara was by him regarded as something of an affront
5208,1088-134315-0057.flac,an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected she returned the papers to the drawer pushed it to and locked it she gave her attention to the second drawer her hand shook a little as she pulled it open
5209,1088-134315-0046.flac,she handed him the letter and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription
5210,1088-134315-0039.flac,he told me he would he would be in at six o'clock at the latest six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently what dog am i that i shouldhe should should wait till six
5211,1088-134315-0015.flac,t x he went on somewhat somewhat iracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
5212,1088-134315-0052.flac,i know he goes in sometimes because i tried a dodge that my brother who's a policeman taught me i stretched a bit of white cotton across and it was broke the next morning mister kara keeps some of his private papers in there said the girl quietly he has told me so himself
5213,1088-134315-0032.flac,he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown and began to descend the stairs to the hall he was less than half way down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him there's a gentleman who wants to see mister kara she said here is his card
5214,1088-134315-0009.flac,is that your creed she asked quietly part of it miss holland he smiled she played idly with the letter she held in her hand balancing it on the edge of the desk her eyes downcast
5215,1088-134315-0013.flac,that is a word i never use nor do i like to hear hear it employed he said blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money
5216,1088-134315-0050.flac,the maid who was also cook arose up as girl entered it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen miss she smiled i'm afraid you're rather lonely missus beale said the girl sympathetically lonely miss cried the maid
5217,1088-134315-0034.flac,he was a man who would have attracted attention if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance he was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check he had a top hat glossy and obviously new at the back of his head

5348,103-1240-0017.flac,the big rambling orchard embowered house were libs where where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
5349,103-1240-0012.flac,had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel rachel deftly putting this and that together might have ooae given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him

5356,103-1240-0034.flac,she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was supposable that marilla was supposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest are you in earnest are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course

5364,103-1240-0056.flac,it seems uncanny to think of er child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them ooks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
5365,103-1240-0011.flac,and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
5366,103-1240-0014.flac,and her afternoon's enjoyment amment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's got and marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman woman and woman finely concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
5367,103-1240-0015.flac,if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more

5371,103-1240-0020.flac,bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a ta little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd rather look at people to be sure
5372,103-1240-0002.flac,for not even a brook for the brook the brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably se and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye sharp eye sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
5373,103-1240-0032.flac,marilla's lips marilla's lips marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
5374,103-1240-0021.flac,they seemed contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a bove the body can get used to anything even to being the being being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
5375,103-1240-0036.flac,marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a a boy from an orphan asylum well the word world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing

5379,103-1240-0028.flac,yet what of matthew's whate white white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down

5381,103-1240-0047.flac,and i know another case were in a bernard bernadopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you o dou didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such such a thing that's what
5382,103-1240-0048.flac,this job's comfortings its comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
5383,103-1240-0049.flac,it's so seldom lem matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks risk there's riss ris there's risks im pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well

5518,289-121665-0028.flac,nothing was left to each sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be and little bo peep was so heart broken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly
5519,289-121665-0005.flac,and there were many willing hands to aid her if which was not often she needed their assistance bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and
