0,6925-80680-0006.flac," the king made no remark, but sent for a palinquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it, bidding the four bearers of the palinquin to take her all the way off into the forest and there leave her. in spite of her tears, she was forced to obey."
1,6925-80680-0072.flac," amirale about low and answered that he had done and would do. the king, all the service that lay in his power, save only this one thing, a thing. the king, who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man, flew into a passion, and the princess was more furious still."
2,6925-80680-0040.flac," and as the storm had by this time passed over, he made his way back to the palace. when he had finished his story, he took the enclot out of his pocket and handed it to the king, who, like everyone else, was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it. indeed,"
3,6925-80680-0036.flac, amir ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager.
4,6925-80680-0070.flac, then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry amir ali.
5,6925-80680-0032.flac, whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard.
6,6925-80680-0039.flac, and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness. a mere alley then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anchored that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot.
7,6925-80680-0020.flac," the old woman's face brightened. she showed him where to seek the water, and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled the brim, she led the way without a word, and he followed. in a short while, they came to a hut in the forest."
8,6925-80680-0069.flac," how do you think our princess is looking now? a very fine, no doubt, grumbled the parrot. but what is the use of dressing up like that for one's health only? she- one's health only. she- one's health only. she ought to have a husband. why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things?"
9,6925-80680-0003.flac," we'll call the guard and ask, and if it was a jackal, i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away. and if it was a tiger, then you shall go, and i will marry a new wife."" as you like, answer the queen. there isn't any doubt which it was."
10,6925-80680-0007.flac, and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood.
11,6925-80680-0037.flac," and bent so that the old woman could clam around to his back, and which she did very nimble. then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck."
12,6925-80680-0081.flac," then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up amir ali, and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside. at the side of her, the king was filled with shame and self-repraach, and wished he could have lived his life over again."
13,6925-80680-0062.flac," and again, amir ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain. at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried, ""'fairy of the forest! fairy of the forest! help me!'"
14,6925-80680-0018.flac," presently, as he made his way through a thicket, he saw a press pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner, so he fired a pellet at it from his galale, but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter. at the same instant, he heard a great clamor from the on of the thicket,"
15,6925-80680-0021.flac," and as they drew near it, a mirror-arly beheld in the doorway, the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on, and on. at the sight of a stranger, she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut, and, much as he wished to see her again,"
16,6925-80680-0065.flac," from her severed hands and head, their fell into the cauldron, and bracelets, and chains, of rubies, and diamonds."
17,6925-80680-0008.flac," and started home again. now the queen thought to herself, and out that the king could not mean to send her away for good, and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back, and her back, and her back. so she stayed quite still for a long time, listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps."
18,6925-80680-0082.flac," and not, and not, and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death. my days, aeous past, said he, and he gave up his crown to his son, amir ali, who, and he, who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne."
19,6925-80680-0029.flac," but each one showed the same strange fear. then amir ali stepped, he stepped, he stepped forward. this is my duty, your majesty, he said. i will go."" the king nodded and off he went. the night was as dark as pitch."
20,6925-80680-0022.flac," i merely could think of no excuse by which to bring her back, and so with i owe with a heavy heart. he made his salutations and bade the old woman farewell. but when he had gone a little way, she called after him. i'm after him. i'm after him. if ever you are in trouble or danger,"
21,6925-80680-0009.flac," but heard none. after a while she grew nervous, for she was all alone, and put her head out of the palinquin, and looked about her. day was just breaking, and birds and insects were beginning to stir."
22,6925-80680-0019.flac," and on reaching the spot, he found an ugly, old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head."
23,6925-80680-0085.flac," she smiles at him and says, is it the tiger then or the jackal?"
24,6925-80680-0034.flac," but a horrid, but horrid kind of witch who really lived in witch land and had no business on earth. if ever a man strayed into witch land, the ogresses used to eat him up, and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper."
25,6925-80680-0038.flac, but amir ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck.
26,6925-80680-0050.flac," then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten, had never forgotten. what is the matter, she asked, in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb"
27,6925-80680-0033.flac," or of the roaring river. as for ghosts and witches, they had never troubled, or, or, or, they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows, where crouched the figure of the woman. what ails you, he said. now the woman was not really a woman at all."
28,6925-80680-0026.flac," and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous. this is just what amir ali wanted, and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish."
29,6925-80680-0075.flac," who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone else to gain both the throne and the princess. as soon as the king was seated, he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant, but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer."
30,6925-80680-0079.flac," to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger, tiger. the king turned first red, red, to red, and then pale. there is continued the farmer, ought to continue the farmer, ought to continue the farmer, a royal tiger bred in the forest, who has the first and only true claim to your throne. where?"
31,6925-80680-0049.flac," therefore, away he went, and after a day's traveling he reached the cottage in the forest, and standing where he had stood when the old, old, old, old woman called to him, he cried. fairy of the forest? fairy of the forest! help me! help me!"
32,6925-80680-0066.flac," then the head and hands were joined onto the body, and it left neither sign nor scar. full of gratitude, amir ali tried to speak to her, but she ran into the house and would not come back, and he was forced to leave her."
33,6925-80680-0028.flac," begged that he might not be sent on such an errand, particularly on a night so wild, when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad. indeed, so frightened was he that the king, who was very kind-hearted, bade another to go in his stead."
34,6925-80680-0078.flac," no, your majesty answered the farmer. i would only remind you—i would only remind you—i would only remind you—that there are plenty of jackals gathered today to try and claim your daughter and kingdom. every city has sent them, and they wait hungry and eager. but do not, o king, mistake or pretend again."
35,6925-80680-0067.flac," when, on the day appointed, amir ali produced a necklace and bracelets. each more beautiful and priceless than the last, the king's astonishment knew no bounds. and as for his daughter, she was nearly mad with joy."
36,6925-80680-0005.flac," mind you, declare that the king is right. it certainly was a jackal. but if we say so, the king will probably not keep his word about going away, and we shall get into trouble, so we had better take his side."" to this, the other agreed."
37,6925-80680-0043.flac, walking grandly about with her treasure tied around her ankle. she heard the starly and say to the parrot.
38,6925-80680-0030.flac," but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water. inch by inch, and foot by foot he fought his way across, now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy, now narrowly escaping,"
39,6925-80680-0071.flac," so the king sent for amir ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honor of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne. on hearing this speech,"
40,6925-80680-0056.flac," then the maiden opened her eyes, sprang to her feet, and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut, and would not come out or speak to him anymore."
41,6925-80680-0041.flac," a myralee himself was astonished. for he had slipped the anklad into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since. the king was delighted at its beauty, and having praised and rewarded a myralee, he gave the anklad to his daughter, a proud and spoiled princess."
42,6925-80680-0059.flac," and never recovered his temper until after lunch. she's got all her— and all her beauty at one end of her now. if she had a few of those fine goo-gaws around her neck and wrists she would look better. but now, to my mind,"
43,6925-80680-0055.flac," and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems, his heart took courage. very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron, and he quickly changed the wands, placed the severed foot against the wound, and immediately the two parts became one as before."
44,6925-80680-0058.flac," and strutted up and down in them, admiring herself in the mirrors that lined the room."
45,6925-80680-0084.flac," she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother, and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl, she gladly returned to fairyland. the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife anymore. if he even looks as if it does not agree with her,"
46,6925-80680-0017.flac," many a weary mile he tram- tram- tram- tram- tram- day after day, until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred, and he stepped joyfully into it, like one who goes to meet an old friend."
47,6925-80680-0063.flac," once more, the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted."
48,6925-80680-0047.flac," or he should be hanged, or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment. pura mirali, or mirali, was greatly troubled at the king's command, but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans. he left the palace at once,"
49,6925-80680-0073.flac," amir ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find. amir signed, and ordered to be kept there. amir there, until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death. mean to death. meanwhile, the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay."
50,6925-80680-0031.flac," being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream. at length he emerged, panting and dripping wet on the other side, close by the bank stood a gallows, and on the gallows hung the body of some evil doer,"
51,6925-80680-0083.flac," there is only one person i will marry,"" said he, and this time the maiden did not run away, but agreed to be his wife. so wife. so the two were married without delay, and lived long and reigned happily. as for the old woman whose picture amir ali had broken,"
52,6925-80680-0011.flac," where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbors. as it was hot weather, the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house, but was awakened by the sound of weeping. he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could, and into the forest towards the place the sound came from."
53,6925-80680-0035.flac," in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue. so when amir ali questioned her, she replied, ah, kind sir, it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows, help me to get him down, and i will bless you forever."
54,6925-80680-0016.flac," a big brass pot to hold water, a few pieces of silver,"
55,6925-80680-0053.flac," and i shall become quite well again as before. at first,"
56,6925-80680-0064.flac," and her head, her words turned amir al-ali pale with horror, but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before, and at last he consented to do as she bade him."
57,6925-80680-0052.flac," and hold it over the cauldron, and every drop of blood that falls from it, and from it into the water will become a jewel. next, you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet, and then one at my feet stands at my head, and place the severed foot against the wound, and it will heal."
58,6925-80680-0080.flac," growing pale as he listened. in prison replied the farmer, if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals, gross, gross, gross, i will explain. clear the court, commanded the king, and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace. now,"
59,6925-80680-0004.flac," so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question, question, question to them. but whilst the dispute was going on, the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said, and one man observed to the other."
60,6925-80680-0042.flac," now, in the women's apartments in the palace, they're hung two cages, in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling, and these two birds could talk as well as human beings. they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was."
61,6925-80680-0044.flac," that was the parrot's name. how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel? think, snap the parrot who was cross, because they hadn't given him his bath that morning. i think she looks like a washer woman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off."
62,6925-80680-0027.flac," soon after this, this, on a dark and stormy night, when the river roared beneath the palace walls, the sound of a woman weeping and whaling was heard above the storm. the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter, but the servant, falling on his knees and terror,"
63,6925-80680-0077.flac, whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up.
64,6925-80680-0015.flac," at last, when he was eight, eight, eight, 18 years of age, they had not the heart to forbid him any longer."
65,6925-80680-0074.flac," so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighboring countries, proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and so to air to the throne should present himself at the palace. when the day came, all the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men, young and old."
66,6925-80680-0024.flac," shortly afterwards, he arrived at a city, and as he was now in great straits."
67,6925-80680-0002.flac," if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen. i say it was a tiger cried the king, don't contradict me. nonsense snapped the queen. it was a jackal. and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said it last. very well."
68,6925-80680-0061.flac," and then she declared to her father, to her father, that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die. again the kings sent for amir ali and ordered him to get an necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month, or be put to a cruel death."
69,6925-80680-0012.flac," and when she had told her story, the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on. and in the farm, a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named amir ali."
70,6925-80680-0023.flac," come to where you now stand and cry, fairy of the forest, fairy of the forest help me now. and i will listen to you."" the prince thanked her and continued his journey, but he thought little of the old woman's sane and much of the lovely damsel."
71,6925-80680-0000.flac," one hot night in hindustan, a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city. every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice, and they hoped they were going to sleep, but they never did. presently they became more broad awake than ever."
72,6925-80680-0010.flac," but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions, there was no sign of any human being. then her spirit gave way, and she began to cry. it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down, there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest."
73,6925-80680-0025.flac, the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more.
74,6925-80680-0014.flac," very few ever came near near near near them, and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make their make his own living. but she and the wise farmer always counseled him to wait until..."
75,6925-80680-0060.flac, she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up. she f-up. poor princess. poor princess. poor princess. she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill.
76,6925-80680-0048.flac," and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels were to be got. but though he sought night and day, he never found one to compare with the anklad. at last, only a week remained, and he was in sore difficulty, when he remembered the ferry of the forest."
77,6925-80680-0068.flac," the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance. and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say,"
78,6925-80680-0076.flac," well, haysin then said the king, i have no time to waste. your majesty, said the farmer, has now lived and administered justice long in this city."
79,6925-80680-0045.flac," why doesn't she wear two of them, who of them instead of going about with one leg adorned on the other? why? why? why? other empty. when the princess heard this, she burst into tears and sending for her father."
80,6925-80680-0001.flac," at the sound of a howl outside the palace. listen to that, that, that, that tiger remarked the king. tiger replied by the queen. how should there be a tiger inside the city? it was only a jackal. i tell you it was a tiger, said the king. and i tell you that you were dreaming."
81,6925-80680-0054.flac," at length, she persuaded him to do her bidding. he nearly offended himself with horror when he found that, after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off, she lay as one lifeless. but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it."
82,6925-80680-0057.flac," but three rare and beautiful anchorts, and these he duly presented to the king on the very day his month of grace was over. the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts, and the next day the vain princess put two anchorts on each foot."
83,6925-80680-0046.flac, or she would die of shame. so the king sent for amir ali.
84,6925-80680-0013.flac," years passed without a sign from the king. his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care, though the queen still lived with the farmer, and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong, handsome, and healthy youth. out in the forest they seemed far from the world."
85,6925-80680-0051.flac," then he told her his story, and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water. the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart, and then turned into him, she said."
86,6437-66173-0049.flac," he had, as we suspected, witnessed—the witness—the closing scene of the fight from the school-room window. and the next morning, after prayers, i was not wholly unprepared when master conway and myself were called up to the desk for examination."
87,6437-66173-0024.flac," you'll get no description of it from me simply because i think it would prove very poor reading, and not because i consider my revolts against conway's tyranny unjustifiable. i had borne conway's persecutions for many months with lamb-like patience."
88,6437-66173-0051.flac," that conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the temple school. their evidence also went to show that conway was a quarrelsome character generally, bad for conway. seth rogers, on the part of his friend,"
89,6437-66173-0002.flac," and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums. conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his own and an accomplishment peculiarly his own, that of throwing his thumbs out of joint at will, at will. sometimes while absorbed in study or on becoming nervous at recitation,"
90,6437-66173-0046.flac," i believe it runs in the family. i think,"" said miss abigail, without the faintest expression on her countenance, that a tablespoonful of hot drop, the captain interrupted miss abigail, preemptively."
91,6437-66173-0010.flac," and keeping my eye fixed steadily on conway's, in all of which i was faithfully following the instruct- instruct- instructions of phil adams, whose father subscribed to a sporting journal. conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude,"
92,6437-66173-0062.flac," he and his shadow, seth rogers, gave me a wide, wide, wide, wide birth for many months. nor was benny wallace subjected to further molestation. miss abigail's sanitary stores, miss abigail's sanitary stores, including a bottle of opa del doc, were never called into requisition."
93,6437-66173-0048.flac," they'll be handy to have in the house,"" says mrs. abigale, grimly. of course, so great a breach of debt of discipline was not to be passed over by mr. grimshaw."
94,6437-66173-0057.flac," if there's any fighting to be done, i am the person to be consulted. i disapprove of boys fighting. it is unnecessary and un-christian. in the present instance, i consider every large boy in this school at fault."
95,6437-66173-0008.flac," he reached forward one of his long arms. he had arms like a windmill, that boy, and grasping me by the hair tore out quite a respectable handful. the tears flew to my eyes."
96,6437-66173-0001.flac," his red hair seemed to change to a livelier red, and his salo cheeks to a deeper salo, as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our slates the next day in school. he knew we were watching him, and made sundry mouths,"
97,6437-66173-0060.flac," we clasp hands. we clasp hands. we clasp hands in the tamest men are imaginable and conway mumbled. i'm sorry i fought with you. fought with you. i think you are, i replied, dryly. and i'm sorry i had to thrash you."
98,6437-66173-0017.flac," but i was going to, because hina knows who put meek's mortar over our door. and i know well enough who did it. it was that sneaking little malatter pointing at me. oh, by george, i cried, reddening at the insult."
99,6437-66173-0000.flac," chapter 10. i fight, i fight, conway. there was one person, however, who cherished a strong suspicion that the centipedes had had a hand in the business, and that person was conway."
100,6437-66173-0011.flac," and there we were, glaring at each other motionless, neither of us disposed to risk an attack, attack, attack, but both on the alert to resist one. there's no telling how long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been interrupted."
101,6437-66173-0036.flac," as scorted by two or three of the schoolfellows, i walked home, home, home, through the pleasant autumn twilight, battered but triumphant. as i went along, my cap cock on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye,"
102,6437-66173-0007.flac," but on seeing me sweep across the yard, whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling, he called out lustily, lay low conway, here's young bailey! conway, there's young bailey! conway, there's young bailey! conway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended for his head."
103,6437-66173-0056.flac," i disapprove of tailbearing. i never encourage it, and i encourage it, and i encourage it, and the slightest degree degree. but when one pupil systematically persecutes a schoolmate, it is the duty of some headboy to inform me. no pupil has a right to take the law into his own hands."
104,6437-66173-0015.flac," and put back my hair, put back my hair."" this last condition was rather a stagurer. ""'i shan't do nothing of the s-'sort,' said conway, sulquely. ""'then the thing must go on,' said adams with dignity."
105,6437-66173-0005.flac," were detained in school for the purpose of refreshing our memories, with a page of mr. andrews perplexing irregular verbs. benny wallace finishing his task first was dismissed. i followed shortly after."
106,6437-66173-0013.flac," the boys fell back perforced on the schoolyard. just at this crisis a dozen or so of the templars enter the gate, and seeing at a glance the belligerent status of conway and myself dropped bat and ball and rushed to the spot where we stood."
107,6437-66173-0027.flac," i'm glad that i faced conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever. i'm glad that phil adams taught me to box, and i say to all youngsters, learn to box, to ride, to pull in or, and to swim."
108,6437-66173-0032.flac," fight it out, and don't give in while you can stand and see. and don't give in when you can't see, for i could stand very little and see not at all, having pummeled the school pump for the last twenty seconds."
109,6437-66173-0029.flac," ever written for boys, ever written for boys are these words. learn to box then, as you learn to play cricket and football. not one of you will be the worst, but very much the better for learning to box well."
110,6437-66173-0061.flac," ""'you can go to your seats,' said mr. grimshaw, turning his face aside to hide a smile. i am not a smile. i am not a smile. i am sure my apology was a very good one.' i never had any more trouble with conway."
111,6437-66173-0025.flac," i might have shielded myself by appealing to mr. grimshaw, but no boy in the temple grammar school could do that without losing cast. whether this was just or not doesn't matter a pin since it was so, a traditionary law of the place."
112,6437-66173-0022.flac," and you'll have the sun in his eyes. behold us once more face to face, like once more face to face, like david and the philistine. look at us as long as you may, for this is all you shall see of the combat."
113,6437-66173-0034.flac," convinced of my error, i accepted his congratulations, with those of the other boys, blandly the other boys, blandly the other boys, blandly and blindly. i remember that benny wallace wanted to give me his silver pencil case."
114,6437-66173-0055.flac," every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to fight. if one boy maltrates another within school bounds or within school hours, that is a matter for me to settle. the case should be laid before me."
115,6437-66173-0004.flac," but the intermission passed off tranquilly, somewhat to our disappointment. at the close of the end of the episode, but the afternoon session, it happened that benny wallace and myself, having got swamped in our laden exercise,"
116,6437-66173-0047.flac, directing her to make a shade out of cardboard and black silk to tie over my eye. miss abigail must have been possessed with the idea that i had taken up pugilism as a profession for she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders.
117,6437-66173-0021.flac," is your man ready? asked phil adams, addressing rogers. adams, addressing rogers. adams, addressing rogers. ready. keep your back to the gate, tom."
118,6437-66173-0035.flac," the gentle soul had stood throughout the contest with his face turned to the fence, suffering untold agony."
119,6437-66173-0059.flac, i now request bailey and conway to shake hands in the hands in the presence of the school and to acknowledge their regret at what has occurred. conway and i approached each other slowly and cautiously as if we were bent upon another hostile collision.
120,6437-66173-0053.flac," i am the boy to be blamed, blamed, for i was the cause of the trouble."" this drew out the story of conway's harsh treatment of the smaller boys. as benny related the—i related the—related the wrongs of his playfellows, saying very little of his own grievances,"
121,6437-66173-0050.flac," as the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of bailey vs. conway, i shall not report the trial further than to say that adams, martin, and several other pupils testified to the fact"
122,6437-66173-0044.flac," captain nutter, as the recognized professional warrior of our family, could not consistently take me to task for fighting conway, task for fighting conway, task for fighting conway, nor was he disposed to do so."
123,6437-66173-0052.flac," proved that i had struck the first blow. that was bad for me."" ""'if you please, sir,' said benny wallace, holding up his hand for permission to speak. bailey didn't find on his own account. he fought on my account. and if you please, sir,'"
124,6437-66173-0031.flac," it's quite right and justifiable if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger. but don't say no because you fear a licking and say or think it's because you fear god, for that's neither christian nor honest. and if you do fight!"
125,6437-66173-0003.flac," he performed the feet unconsciously. throughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a chronic state of dislocation, indicating great mental agitation on the part of the owner. we fully expected an outbreak from him at recess."
126,6437-66173-0043.flac," produced an expression of which miss abigail declared she had never seen the like, accepting on the face of a chinese idol. she hustled me, unceremoniously, into the presence of my grandfather in the sitting room."
127,6437-66173-0037.flac," i felt that i was not only following my nose, but following it so closely that i was in some danger of trep-trep-treting on it. i seemed to have-to have nose enough for the whole party. my left cheek also was puffed out like a dumpling."
128,6437-66173-0038.flac," i couldn't help saying to myself, if this is victory, how about that other fellow? tom said harry blake hesitating. well?"
129,6437-66173-0028.flac," the occasion may come round when a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments will be of service to you. in one of the best books,"
130,6437-66173-0040.flac," shouldn't wonder. no, he didn't, broken adams, or he would have stopped it short meter."
131,6437-66173-0042.flac," miss abigail, opening the front door, started back at my hilarious appearance. i tried to smile upon her sweetly, but the smile, rippling over my swollen cheek and dying away like a spent wave on my nose,"
132,6437-66173-0054.flac," i noticed that mr. grimshaw's hand, unknown to himself perhaps, rested lightly from time to time from time to time on wallace's sunny hair. the examination finished, mr. grimshaw leaned on the desk thoughtfully for a moment, and then said,"
133,6437-66173-0045.flac," for the captain was well aware, captain was well aware of the long continued provocation i had endured. ah, you rascal, crowd the old. ah, you rascal, crowd the old gentleman after hearing my story. just like me when i was young, always i was young, always i was young, always in one kind of trouble or another."
134,6437-66173-0039.flac," did you see mr. grimshaw looking out of the recitation room window just as we left the yard? no, was he though? i'm sure of it."
135,6437-66173-0041.flac," well, it can't be helped now. can't be helped now,"" i reflected. as the monkey said, said, when he fell out of the coconut tree, added charlie martin, trying to make me laugh. it was early candlelight when we reached the house."
136,6437-66173-0033.flac," when conway retired from—when conway retired from—when conway retired from the field. as phil adam stepped up to shake hands with—with me, he received a telling blow in the stomach, for all the fight was not out of—of—of me yet, and i bestook him for a new adversary."
137,6437-66173-0023.flac," according to my thinking, the hospital teaches, teaches, teaches a better lesson than the battlefield. i will tell you about my, tell you about my, tell you about my black eye and my swollen lip, if you will. but not a word of the fight."
138,6437-66173-0016.flac," rogers, as i understand it, is your second conway? bailey camir, what's the rower about? he was thrashing benny wallace. no i wasn't interrupted conway."
139,6437-66173-0026.flac," the personal inconvenience i suffered from my—suffered from my—suffered from my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted—pain he inflicted on me indirectly by his persistent cruelty to—to little, to little, biny wallace. i should have lacked the spirit of a hen if i had not resented it, finally."
140,6437-66173-0020.flac," conway regarded these business-like preparations with evident misgiving, for he called rogers to his side and had himself arrayed in a similar manner, though his hair was cropped so close that you couldn't have taken hold of it with a pair of tweezers."
141,6437-66173-0009.flac," but they were not the tears of defeat. they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature paid to the departed trecess. in a second my little jacket lay on the ground and i stood on guard resting lightly on my right leg,"
142,6437-66173-0014.flac," is it a fight? asked, asked phil adams, who saw by our freshness that we had not yet got to work. yes, it's a fight, i answered. unless conway will ask wallace's pardon, promise never to hector me in future."
143,6437-66173-0030.flac," that you have to say yes or no to a challenge to fight, say no if you can, only take care you make it plain to yourself why you say no. it's a proof of the highest courage if done from true christian motives."
144,6437-66173-0019.flac," muttered phil, twitching the handkerchief to ascertain, and, and if it were securely tied. he then loosened my gallowses, braces, and buckled them tightly, mutt, and buckled them tightly above my hips. now then, pantom, never say die."
145,6437-66173-0012.flac," it was accustomed with the larger pupils to return to the playground after school and play baseball until sundown. the d.a. baseball until sundown. the town authorities had prohibited ball playing on the square, and there being no other available place."
146,6437-66173-0018.flac," cool is the word,"" said adams, as he bound, bound a hankerchief round my head, and carefully tucked away the long-stragling locks, ling locks, ling locks, that offered attempting advancing advantage to the enemy. whoever heard of a fellow with such a head of hair going into action."
147,6437-66173-0058.flac," but as the offense is one of omission rather than comission, my punishment must rest only on the two boys convicted of misdemeanor. conway loses his recess for a month, and bailey has a page added to his latin lessons for the next four recitations."
148,6437-66173-0006.flac," and, unstepping into the playground, saw my little friend plastered as it were, up against the fence. and conway, standing in front of him, ready to deliver a blow on the upturned, unprotected face, whose gentleness would have stayed any arm but a cowards."
149,6437-66172-0021.flac," in a low tone, as if not intended for the ear of the victim. diabolus fetch me the red and red and red hot iron. the expedition with which that tongue would disappear was simply ridiculous."
150,6437-66172-0004.flac," though i was an active member of the body during the remainder of my residence at rivermouth, and at one time held the onerous position of fc, first centipede. each of the elect wore a copper cent."
151,6437-66172-0024.flac," by these simple and ingenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition, sometimes, sometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter. i have said that the society had no special object. it is true there was a tacit understanding among us."
152,6437-66172-0028.flac," jones' avenue at the north end had suddenly become walnut street, and penut street was nowhere to be found. confusion reigned. the town authorities took the matter in hand without delay."
153,6437-66172-0027.flac," about a week after my admission into the secret order, the quiet citizens awoke to find that the signboards of all the principal streets had changed places during the night. people who went trustfully to sleep in current square opened their eyes in honeysuckle terrace."
154,6437-66172-0023.flac," whenever a member had reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend, he called a meeting. for instance, immediately on learning the death of harry blake's great-grandfather, i issue to call."
155,6437-66172-0020.flac," if he showed the slightest terror he was certain to be tricked unmercifully, to be tricked unmercifully, to be tricked unmercifully. one of our subsequent devices, a humble invention of my own, was to request the blindfolded candidate to put out his tongue, whereupon the first centipede would say,"
156,6437-66172-0013.flac," gently checked my retreat. i was then conducted—i was then conducted—i was then conducted to the brink of several other precipices and—chance—and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms, where the result would have been instant death if i had committed the least mistake."
157,6437-66172-0009.flac," if i felt myself physically, too weak to undergo the necessary tortures. i replied that i was not too weak and atoned which i intended to be resolute, but which in spite of me seemed to come from the pit of my stomach. it is well."
158,6437-66172-0036.flac," there was a certain slim, mild apothecary in the town by the name of meeks. it was generally given out that mr. meeks had a vague desire to get married, but being a shy and timorous youth lacked the moral courage to do so."
159,6437-66172-0011.flac," the unknown voice then directed me to take ten steps forward and stop at the word halt. i took ten steps and halted. stric and mortal set a second husky voice, more husky if possible than the first."
160,6437-66172-0017.flac," that there were no vestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which i had passed so cautiously. my ascent had been to the top of the hog's head, and my decent to the bottom thereof. holding one another by the hand, and chanting a low dirge,"
161,6437-66172-0016.flac," surrounded by twelve masked figures fantastically dressed. one of the conspirators was really appalling, with a tin saucepan on his head, and a tiger's tiger skin sleigh robe thrown over his shoulders. i scarcely need say"
162,6437-66172-0035.flac," and now he had caused us to be arraigned before justice clapp him on a charge equally groundless and painful. after much noisy discussion, a plan of retaliation was agreed upon."
163,6437-66172-0012.flac," if you would advance to another inch, you would have disappeared down in a bis three thousand feet deep. i naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information. a prick from some two-pronged instrument, evidently a pitchfork,"
164,6437-66172-0001.flac," the distraction which prevailed in the class, the classes the week preceding the fourth had subsided, and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities, accepting a noticeable want of eyebrows on the part of pepper whitcom and myself."
165,6437-66172-0041.flac," to kill less, less, less than three birds with one stone did not suit our sanguineary purpose. we disliked the widow not so much for her sentimentality, as for being, being, being the mother of bill conway. we disliked mr. meeks not because he was incipid,"
166,6437-66172-0031.flac," to answer the demands of the outrage laws. charlie marden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his father's house, and looked like a recently exhumed mummy. there was not the least evidence against us, and indeed we were wholly innocent of the offense."
167,6437-66172-0005.flac," some occult association being established between a cent-a-pease and a cent-a-pease suspended by a string round his neck. the medals were worn next to the skin, and it was while bathing one day at grave point with jack harris and fred langdon."
168,6437-66172-0008.flac," such was the modest title given to the loft over my friend's woodhouse. my hands were securely pinioned, and my eyes covered with a thick silk handkerchief. at the head of the stairs i was told in an unrecognizable husky voice."
169,6437-66172-0002.flac," in august, we had two weeks vacation. it was about this time that i became a member of the rivermouth centipedes, a secret society composed of twelve of the temple grammar school boys."
170,6437-66172-0019.flac," i afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club. for these initiations, as you may imagine, were sometimes very, very, very comical spectacles, especially when the aspirant for centipetal honors happened to be of a timid disposition."
171,6437-66172-0018.flac," the mystic twelve revolved about me. this concluded the ceremony. with a merry shout, the boys withdrew off their masks, and i was declared a regularly installed member of the rmc."
172,6437-66172-0015.flac," a second pistol shot was heard. the something i stood on sunk with a crash beneath my feet, and i felt, and i felt, and i felt two miles as nearly as i could compute it. at the same instant, the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes, and i found myself standing in an empty hog's head."
173,6437-66172-0034.flac, it was unanimously resolved that conway's animosity should not be quietly submitted to. he had sought to inform against us in the stage-stage-stage-coach business. he had volunteered to carry petongill's little bill for 24 ice creams to charlie mardin's father.
174,6437-66172-0039.flac," casting destructive glances across the street. the artificial roses in her cap and her whole languishing, languishing, languishing manner saying as plainly as a label on the prescription to be taken immediately. but mr. meeks didn't take."
175,6437-66172-0044.flac," was recognized at once. it spread like wildfire over the town, and, though the mortar and the and the placard were speedily removed, our triumph was complete. the whole community was on the broad grin and our participation in the affair seemingly unsuspected."
176,6437-66172-0029.flac," and six of the temple grammar school boys were summoned to appear here and here and here, before justice clap, and clap, clap them. having tearfully disclaimed my grandfather all knowledge of the transaction, i disappeared from the transaction, i disappeared from the transaction, i disappeared from the family circle, and was not apprehended until late in the afternoon."
177,6437-66172-0032.flac," the trick, as was afterwards proved, had been played by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor. we were indebted for our arrest to master conway, who had slightly dropped a hint within the hearing of selechtman mudge to the effect that"
178,6437-66172-0006.flac," that i had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch by a sight of these singular emblems. as soon as i ascertained the existence of a boys' club, of course i was ready to die to join it, and eventually i was allowed to join."
179,6437-66172-0026.flac," to mystify the state and slow-going river mouthyans was our frequent pleasure. several of our pranks won us such a reputation among the townsfolk, that we were credited with having a large finger in whatever went to miss in the place. one morning,"
180,6437-66172-0033.flac," young bailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs. when he was called upon to make good his assertion, he was considerably more terrified than the centipedes, though they were ready to sink into their shoes. at our next meeting,"
181,6437-66172-0040.flac, the ladies fondness and the gentleman's blindness were topical topics ably handled at every sewing circle in the town. it was through these two luckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common enemy.
182,6437-66172-0043.flac," on the following morning, as the orderly citizens wendered their way to church, passed the widows a bowed, their sober faces relaxed at beholding over her front door, the well-known guilt, mortar and pestle which usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner."
183,6437-66172-0022.flac," our meetings were held in various barns at no stated periods, but as circumstances suggested. any member had a right to call a meeting. each boy who failed to report himself was fined one cent."
184,6437-66172-0000.flac," in the course of ten ten ten days i recovered sufficiently from my injuries to attend school, where for a little while i was looked upon as a hero on account of having been blown up. what don't we make a hero of?"
185,6437-66172-0042.flac," like his own like his own syrups, but because the widow loved him. bill conway, we hated for him like like we hated for himself. late one dark saturday night in september, we carried our plan into effect."
186,6437-66172-0010.flac," a prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination, and i was wondering what would come next."
187,6437-66172-0038.flac," were of a nature not to be misunderstood, and were not misunderstood by anyone, but mr. makes himself. the widow carried on to dress making establishment at her residence, on the corner opposite makes's drugstore."
188,6437-66172-0007.flac," the initiation ceremony took place in fred langdon's barn, where i was submitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a timber or a spoi. before being led to the grotto of enchantment,"
189,6437-66172-0003.flac," this was an honor to which i had long aspired, but being a new boy i was not admitted to the fraternity until my character had fully developed itself. it was a very select society, the object of which i never fathomed,"
190,6437-66172-0025.flac," that the centipedes were to stand by, i want another, on all occasions, though i don't remember that they did. but further than this, we hadn't had that no purpose, unless it was to accomplish as a body, the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as individuals."
191,6437-66172-0014.flac," i have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by dismal groans from different parts of the grotto. finally, i was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an incalculable height."
192,6437-66172-0030.flac," when the captain dragged me, the captain dragged me ignominously from the hay-mow, and conducted me more dead than alive to the office of justice clapham. here i encountered five other pallid culprits, who had been fished out of divers, coal-bens, carrots, and chicken-coops."
193,6437-66172-0037.flac," it was also well known that—well, known—that the widow conway had not buried her heart with the late lamented. as to her shyness that was not so clear, indeed her attentions to mr. meagues, whose mother she might have been,"
194,625-132118-0019.flac," that was to rise within the veil. and so, so, so, we dreamed, and loved, loved, loved, and planned by fall and winter, and the full flush of the long southern spring."
195,625-132118-0003.flac," while i was unconsciously wandering. i fled to my wife, finchild, repeating the while to myself half-wonderingly, wanderingly, wife and child. wife and child."
196,625-132118-0001.flac," thou hast forgotten, o summer swallow, but the world shall end when i forget. swinburn."
197,625-132118-0036.flac," in vain. for where, o god, beneath, beneath, beneath thy broad blue sky shall my dark baby rest in peace, where reverence dwells and goodness, and a freedom that is free."
198,625-132118-0039.flac," which his father had hardly crushed in his own heart. for what, for sooth shall a negro want with, negro want with pride amid the studied humiliation of fifty million fellows? well, sped, my boy."
199,625-132118-0002.flac, sang the bit of yellow paper that fluttered into my room one brown october morning. then the fear of fatherhood mingled wildly with the joy of creation. i wondered how it looked.
200,625-132118-0000.flac, of the passing of the first born.
201,625-132118-0030.flac," pino no color line, poor deer. in the veil though it shadowed him, had not yet darkened half his son. he loved the white matron, he loved his black nurse."
202,625-132118-0032.flac," she who, in simple clear-ness of vision, sees beyond the stars stars, said when he had flown. he will flown. he will flown. he will be happy there. he ever loved beautiful things."
203,625-132118-0007.flac," i handle it curiously and watch, perplexed, it's winking, breathing and sneezing. i did not love it then, it seemed a ludicrous thing to love, but her i loved."
204,625-132118-0012.flac," bitterly the unbout pride of a hunted race, clinging with that tiny dimpled hand, uh, wearily, to a hope not hopeless but unhopeful."
205,625-132118-0020.flac," till the hot winds rolled from the fetted gulf, till the roses shivered, and the still-sterned sun quivered its awful light over the hills of atlanta. and then one night, the little feet padded wearily to the wee white bed."
206,625-132118-0048.flac, was not the world's olympic time in his young hands and is not my time time time waning are there so many workers in the vineyard that the fair promise of this little body
207,625-132118-0044.flac," and wake into the morning. a morning when men ask of the workmen, not is he white, but can he work? when men ask artists, not are they black, but do they know?"
208,625-132118-0031.flac," and in his little world walked souls alone, uncolored, and uncolored, and uncloed. i, ye all men, were larger and pure by the infinite breadth of that one little life."
209,625-132118-0013.flac," and seeing with those bright, wondering eyes that peer into my soul, a land whose freedom is to us a mockery and whose liberty, a lie."
210,625-132118-0040.flac," before the world had dubbed your ambition insolence, and held your ideals unattainable, and taught you to cringe and bow."
211,625-132118-0022.flac," out into the starlight i crept to rouse the grey physician. the shadow of death. the shadow of death. the hour strumbled on, on, the night listened."
212,625-132118-0041.flac, better far this nameless void that stops my life than a sea of sorrow for you. idol words.
213,625-132118-0046.flac," and all have i foregone at that command, and with small complaint, all saved that fair young form that lies so coldly wed with death."

215,625-132118-0021.flac," and the tiny hands trembled, trembled, trembled, and a warm flushed face tossed on the pillow. then we knew baby was sick. tensick. tensies, he lay there, a swift week."
216,625-132118-0009.flac," as his little soul unfolded itself in twitter and cry and half-formed word, and as its eyes caught the gleam and flash of life. how beautiful he was."
217,625-132118-0008.flac," my girl mother, she whom now i saw unfolding like the glory of the morning, the transfigured woman. through her i came to love the we-thing, we-thing, as it grew strong."
218,625-132118-0026.flac," is not this my life hard enough. it's not that dull land that stretches its sneering web about me cold enough. it's not all the world beyond these four little walls pittiless enough, but that thou must need enter here thou o' death."

229,625-132118-0050.flac," sleep then, child. sleep till i sleep. and wake into a baby voice and the ceaseless powder of little feet."
230,625-132118-0025.flac," i shirk not. i long for work. i pant for a life full of striving. i am no coward to shrink before the rugged rush of the storm, nor even quail before the awful shadow of the veil, but hark and oh death."

232,625-132118-0014.flac," i saw the shadow of the veil as it, as it, as it, as it passed over my baby. i saw the cold city towering above the blood-red land. i held my face beside his little cheek."
233,625-132118-0045.flac, some morning this may be long long years to come but now now now there whales on that dark shore within the veil the same deep voice thou shalt forego

240,625-132118-0047.flac," in the nest i had build it. if one must have gone, why not i? why may i not rest me from this restlessness? and sleep from this wide waking?"
241,625-132118-0043.flac," surely there shall yet dawn some mighty morning to lift the veil and set the prisoned free. not for me, i shall die in my bonds, but for fresh young souls who have not known the night,"

246,625-132112-0006.flac," their cabins look better than most, and the farm with the machinery and fertilizers is much more business like than any in the county, although the manager drives hard bargains in wages. when now we turn and look five miles above,"
247,625-132112-0002.flac," the harder the slaves were driven, the more careless and fatal was their farming. then came the revolution of war and emancipation, the bewilderment of reconstruction. and now, what is the egypt of the confederacy?"
248,625-132112-0038.flac," the whistle-place, which includes his bit of land, was bought soon after the war by an english syndicate. the dixie cotton and corn company. a marvelous deal of style their factory put on, with his servants and cochin-six. so much so."
249,625-132112-0001.flac," sheltered and secure. it became the place of refuge for families, wealth, and slaves. yet, yet, even then, the hard, ruthless rape of the land began to tell. the red clay subsoil already had begun to peer above the loam."

257,625-132112-0014.flac, we passed one fenced stock farm with grass and grazing cattle that looked very home-like after endless corn and cotton. here in there are black freeholders. there is the gaunt dull black jackson with his hundred acres.
258,625-132112-0048.flac," but the owner will not sell off a few acres. two children, a boy and a girl, are hoeing sturdily in the fields on the farm where corlus works. he is smooth-faced and brown, and is fencing up his pigs."
259,625-132112-0044.flac," welcome. quite a contrast to the southwestern part of dauertie county is the northwest. soberly timbreed in okan pine, it has none of that half-tropical luxuriance of the southwest."

261,625-132112-0055.flac," and a few have time to talk. tired with the long ride, we gladly drive into gillensville. it is a silent cluster of farmhouses standing on the crossroads with one of its doors closed and the other kept by a negro preacher."
262,625-132112-0011.flac," improvement companies, wine companies, companies, mills and factories, most failed and foreigners fell air. it is a beautiful land this d'arty west of the flint. the forests are wonderful."
263,625-132112-0056.flac," it was one of those scenes one cannot soon forget. a wide, wide, wide, little, little, little house whose motherly roof reached over and sheltered a snug little porch. there we sat, after the long, hot drive, drinking cool water."

268,625-132112-0019.flac," was a part of the famous bolton estate. after the war, it was for many years worked by gangs of negro convicts, and black convicts then were even more plentiful than now. it was a way of making negro's work, and the question of guilt was a minor one."
269,625-132112-0052.flac," we passed the months in place where a plucky white widow is renting and struggling, struggling, and the eleven hundred acres of the senate plantation with its negro overseer."
270,625-132112-0005.flac," five miles below here is a town owned and controlled by one white new englander. he owns almost a rhode island county, with thousands of acres and hundreds of black labourers."

273,625-132112-0029.flac," as it is, he is hopelessly in debt, disappointed, and embittered. he stopped us to inquire after the black boy in albany, whom it was said a policeman had shot and killed, for loud talking on the sidewalk."
274,625-132112-0025.flac," the bolton convict farm formally included the neighboring plantation. here it was that the convicts were lodged in the great log prison still standing. a dismal place it still remains, with rows of ugly huts."
275,625-132112-0039.flac," that the concern soon landed in an extricable bankruptcy. nobody lives in the old house now, but a man comes each winter out of the north and collects his high rents. i know not which are the more touching, such old empty houses."
276,625-132112-0003.flac," and yonder in the field is heard and your dark, young husband, hoeing to support her at thirty cents a day without bored. across the way and away, and his gates be, brown and tall, lord of two thousand acres, shrewdly one and held."
277,625-132112-0042.flac," i remember wheeling around a bend in the road. beside a graceful bit of forest and a singing brook, a long low house faced us, with porch and flying pillars, great oak and door, and a broad lawn shining in the evening sun."
278,625-132112-0027.flac," there is little of the joyous abandon and playfulness which we are want to associate with the plantation negro. at best, the natural good nature is edged with complaint, or has changed into silliness and gloom."
279,625-132112-0046.flac," and there were fences and meadows here and there. most of this land was poor, and beneath the notice of the slave-barren before the war, since then his poor relations and foreign immigrants have seized it."

286,625-132112-0037.flac," but a white man, but a white man, but a white man loaned me another, then he added, eyeing us."
287,625-132112-0032.flac," happy? happy? well, yes, he laughed and flipped pebbles and thought the world was. he had worked here twelve years, and has nothing but a mortgage mule. children? yes, seven, but they hadn't been to school this year."
288,625-132112-0045.flac," then, too, there are fewer signs of a romantic past and more of systematic modern land grabbing and money-gidding. white people are more in evidence here."

293,625-132112-0034.flac," here and there we meet distinct characters, quite out of the ordinary. one came out of a piece of newly cleared round, making a wide detour to avoid the snakes. he was an old, old, old, hollow, cheeked man, with a drawn,"
294,625-132112-0017.flac," even then, however, the fields as we proceed begin to redden and the trees disappear. rose of old cabins appear filled with renters and laborers. cheerless, bare and dirty for the most part. although here and there."
295,625-132112-0040.flac," or the homes of the masters, or the masters of the masters' sons. sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those white doors. tales of poverty, of struggle, of disappointment, a revolution such as that of 63 is a terrible thing."
296,625-132112-0018.flac," so he moved here, where the rent is higher, the land poorer, and the owner inflexible. he rents a $40 mule for $20 a year. poor lad, a slave at $20.22. this plantation owned now by a foreigner."
297,625-132112-0035.flac," made nothing for two years, but i reckon i got a crop now. the cotton looked tall and rich, and we praised it. may we praise it. he curtsyed low, and then bowed almost to the ground."
298,625-132112-0013.flac, the planters are in debt to the merchants. the tenants owe the planters and laborers bow and bend beneath the burden of it all. here and there a man has raised his head above these murky waters.
299,625-132112-0054.flac," the overseers are white, and the cabins are bare, boardhouses scattered here and there. the renters are high, and day laborers and contract hands abound. it is a keen, hard struggle for living here."
300,625-132112-0022.flac," slow, dull, and discouraged, shuffles to our carriage, and talks hopelessly. why should he strive? every year finds him deeper in debt. how strange that georgia, the world heralded refuge of poor debtors."
301,625-132112-0012.flac," the solemn pines have disappeared, and this is the oaky woods, with its wealth of hickories, beaches, oaks and polmetos. but a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful land. the merchants are in debt to the wholesalers."
302,625-132112-0036.flac," with an imperturbable gravity, with an imperturbable gravity that seemed almost suspicious. then he continued, ma'amul died last week, a calamity in this land, equal to a devastating fire in town."
303,625-132112-0007.flac," they're on the edge of town, or five, then five, the five houses of prostitutes. two of blacks, then three of whites. and in one of the houses of the whites, a worthless black boy was harbored too openly two years ago. so he was hanged for rape."
304,6000-86686-0021.flac," then, says the king, who are you? i'm saint kevin,"" said the saint, blessing himself. whole queen of heaven, says the king, making the sign of the cross between his eyes and falling down at his knees before the saint. it is the great saint kevin,"" says he."
305,6000-86686-0023.flac," and so your saint says the king, i am, am, says saint kevin. pied chabers, i thought i was only talking to a decent boy, says the king, well you know the difference now, says the saint. and saint kevin says he the greatest of all the saints."
306,6000-86686-0022.flac, that i've been discourseing all this time without knowing it. so see.

308,6000-86686-0009.flac," with that the king whistled and down came the poor goose just like a hound, waddling up to the poor cripple her master, and as like him as two peas. the minute the saint clapped his eyes on the goose, i'll do the job for you, as he, king o'toole."
309,6000-86686-0013.flac," this is the bargain i'll make with your king o'toole. will you give me all the grounds the goose flies over the first offer after i make hers good as new? i knew. i will, says the king. you won't go back on your word. says st. kevin."
310,6000-86686-0004.flac," you see it was st. kavan, sure enough, the saint himself and disguise and nobody else. oh, never mind, says he. i know more than that."
311,6000-86686-0001.flac, and it was he that owned the churches in the early days. the king you see was the right sort. he was the real boy and loved sport as he was. and loved sport as he was. and loved sport as he loved his life. and hunting in particular. and from the rising of the sun up he got. and away he went over the mountains after the deer.
312,6000-86686-0000.flac," well, well, but the darkness of mankind, mankind mankind is untoldable. well, sir, you must know as you didn't hear it before that there was a king."
313,6000-86686-0024.flac," and so the king had his goose as good as his new to divert him as long as he lived, and the saint supported him after he came into his property as i told you, until the day of his death. and that was soon after, for the poor goose that he was catching a trout one friday,"
314,6000-86686-0002.flac," and thinking of drowned on himself that could get no diversion in life. when all of a sudden, turning around the corner,"

317,6000-86686-0007.flac," is it a tinker you are? says the king? no, says the saint. the saint. i'm no tinker by trade, king or tool."
318,6000-86686-0025.flac," but my jewel it was a mistake he made, and instead of a trout it was a thieving horse-eal, and instead of the goose killing a trout for the king's supper, by dad the eel killed the king's goose, and small blame to him."
319,6000-86686-0018.flac," says st. kevin, for making her the like. by chaper says the king. i say nothing be to the art of man bar in the bees. says the bees. and do you say no more nor that says st. kevin. and that time beholden to you. says the king."
320,6000-86686-0020.flac," when the king was as good as his word, st. cabin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the king. and, says he, king o'toole, your decent ban, for i only came here to try you. you don't know me, says he, because i'm disguised. moshua!"
321,6000-86686-0017.flac, looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark and better than ever she was.
322,6000-86686-0008.flac," says he, what would you say, says he, if i made your old goose as good as new? my dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new, you'd think the poor old king's eyes were ready to jump out of his head."
323,6000-86686-0015.flac," and it's i that will make you this and this and this sporting bird. with that my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings."
324,6000-86686-0005.flac," blur an aiders, how came you to know about my goose?"" says the king. ""'o no matter, i was given to understand it,' says st. kevin. after some more talk, the king says, ""'what are you?' ""'i'm an honest man,' says st. kevin.' ""'well, honest man,' says the king."
325,6000-86686-0014.flac, honor bright says king o'toole holding out his fist. honor bright says st. kevin back again. it's a bargain. come here says he to the poor old goose.
326,6000-86686-0019.flac," i will,"" says king o'toole, and your welcome to it, says he, though it's the last acre i have to give. but you keep your word true,"" says the saint. as true is the sun, sun says the king. it's well for you, king o'toole, that you said that word, says he."
327,6000-86686-0010.flac," by germany says king o'toole. he says king o'toole. if you do all say you're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes, oh by god says st. kevin."
328,6000-86686-0006.flac, and how is it you make your money so easy?
329,6000-86686-0012.flac, says the saint. that's the way to do business now.
330,6000-55211-0037.flac," william hensha too raised his chin. he also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people. my name is hensha, miss gregory, i presume. he said quietly, i was sent here by mr. harlow."
331,6000-55211-0020.flac," there was only despairing sorrow on her face now. oh, oh. the man rose at once."
332,6000-55211-0021.flac," what a- the beauty! mrs. gregory had thrown up in the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair, disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot, creamy intent and exquisitely decorated in a rose design."
333,6000-55211-0030.flac," she finished with a wimp, a wimp, a wimp, a wimp's a calady. billy turned away sharply. there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes. she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against, she did not know what exactly, but she fancied it was against the teapot."
334,6000-55211-0003.flac," harlow says others will have to know of it, of course. you see, she's just made up her mind to sell it, and asked him to find a customer. i wouldn't trouble you, but he says they're peculiar, the daughter especially, and may need some careful handling. that's why i wanted you."
335,6000-55211-0046.flac," and the final plea of the collector, who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp. i am very sorry, of course, if my offer has annoyed you. my offer has annoyed you. my offer has annoyed you."" he said, he said stiffly. i certainly should not have made it, had i not not had mrs. gregory's assurance, that she wished to sell the teapot."
336,6000-55211-0057.flac," we prefer them infinitely to charity. oh, but please, i didn't mean you didn't understand, faltered billy. for answer alice gregory walked deliberately to the door and held it open. oh alice, my dear. pleaded mrs. gregory again feebly."
337,6000-55211-0013.flac," however, she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the whole, how all, how all behind them a voice denying her assertion. mrs. gregory was a cripple. her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches."
338,6000-55211-0009.flac," but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached, the man looked about him with a troubled frown. i declared billy, i'm not sure, but we'd better turn back, he fredded. i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this. billy shivered a little."
339,6000-55211-0008.flac, i'll tell her though and i'll see you at 11 finished billy as she hung up the receiver promptly at the receiver promptly at the receiver promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william park street and together they set out out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket.
340,6000-55211-0034.flac," brought. of course, if it's worth that to you, she pauses suddenly. a quick step had sounded in the hall outside. the next moment the door flew open."
341,6000-55211-0035.flac," mother only think i've- i've- i've- i've- she stopped and drew back a little. her startled eyes went from one face to another, then dropped to the lowest-stopped teapot in the man's hands. her expression changed once. she shut the door quickly and hurried forward."
342,6000-55211-0041.flac," william henshoff frowned angrily. that was the man, but his man, but his man, but his eyes. the collector's eyes saw all of the teapot longingly. before either the man or the collector could speak, however, mrs. gregory interposed quick words of remonstrance."
343,6000-55211-0031.flac," against uncle william for wanting the teapot, or for not wanting it if he did not buy it. and so you see, i do very much wish to sell. mrs. gregory said then, perhaps he will tell me what it would be worth to you. she concluded triumphantly."
344,6000-55211-0024.flac," and there's the tray. did you notice?"" he exalted, turning back to the shelf. ""'you don't see that every day. they get separated most generally, you know.' ""'these pieces have been in our family for generations,' said mrs. gregory with an accent of pride."
345,6000-55211-0036.flac," mother, what is it? who are these people? she asked sharply. billy lifted her chin the least bit. the least bit. she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name. billy was not used to being called these people, and precisely that tone of voice."
346,6000-55211-0000.flac," chapter 16, a girl and a bit of- bit of lois-toft. immediately after breakfast that the next morning, billy was summoned to the telephone. oh, good morning, uncle william. she called and answered to the mass-ask-ask-ask-ill-in-voice that replied to her, hello."
347,6000-55211-0038.flac," stammered mrs. gregory, wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and in conciliation. this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it. or my daughter alice, mr. hensha, she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and mis."
348,6000-55211-0047.flac," alice gregory turned as if stung, wished to sell. she repeated the words with superb disdain. she was plainly very angry. her blue grey eyes gleamed with scorn, and her whole face was diffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair."
349,6000-55211-0056.flac," even while she shook her head and denied, denied denial. not so, her daughter, alice gregory flushed scarlet. she, scarlet, she drew herself proudly erect. thank you, she said with crisp, she said with crisp coldness. but distasteful as dorns and patches are to us,"
350,6000-55211-0004.flac, though i wanted you to see the teapot too.
351,6000-55211-0012.flac," billy really, i think we should turn back. but billy would not turn back, and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes, she was mrs. gregory, yes she was. even as she uttered the words,"
352,6000-55211-0044.flac," billy, watching the little scene with mingle demotions, saw the glance with which the girls swept the bare little room, and she knew that there was not a patch, or darn, or poverty spot in sight, or out of sight, which that glance did not encompass."
353,6000-55211-0050.flac," perhaps they think, think, think, think, too, we wish to live in a place like this, that we wish to have rugs that are dark and chairs that are broken, that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes. alice! gast mrs. gregory and miss maid horror."
354,6000-55211-0054.flac," and then, won't you keep it for me? here? i haven't the hundred dollars with me, but i'll send it right away. you will let me do it, won't you? it was an impulsive speech and a foolish one, of course, from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness."
355,6000-55211-0053.flac," or what to say, oi. but it showed too, as clearly, that he longed to do something or say something. during the brief minute that he hesitated, however, billy sprang forward. mrs. gregory, please, won't you let me by the teapot?"
356,6000-55211-0042.flac," but alice, my dear. alice, my dear, she almost sobbed. you didn't wait to let me tell you."
357,6000-55211-0029.flac," but with only one foot to make it go, you see the other is..."
358,6000-55211-0033.flac," i paid $100 for that. i shall be glad to give you the same for this, madam. mrs. gregory started visibly. $100. so much is that? she cried almost joyously."
359,6000-55211-0049.flac," i can't help it, storm the girl hotly. i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's. i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all. and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it."
360,6000-55211-0061.flac," still, i was sorry for the poor little old lady. i wished somehow she could have had that hundred dollars. it was the man who said this, not the collector. so do i, rejoined billy dolefully."
361,6000-55211-0032.flac," the collector's eyes glowed. he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it. then he turned to the tray. after a moment he spoke. i have only one other in my collection as rare, he said."
362,6000-55211-0051.flac," with a little outward fling of her two hands, alice gregory stepped back. her face had grown white again. i'd beg your pardon, of course. she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet. i should not have spoken so."
363,6000-55211-0022.flac," near it, set a tray-like plate of the same wear and decoration. if you lift it down, please yourself, motioned mrs. gregory. i don't like to, with these, she explained, tapping the crutches at her side."
364,6000-55211-0017.flac," we, or i, came from harlow, mrs. gregory. he gave me to understand that you had a teapot that, or with his eyes on the cracked white crockery picture on the table, william henshaw came to a helpless pause."
365,6000-55211-0027.flac," madam, if you do not wish to sell, he stopped abruptly. his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china. mrs. gregory gave a low cry. but i do, that is, i must."
366,6000-55211-0045.flac," billy was wondering which she herself desired, which she herself desired, which she herself desired more, that uncle william should buy the lowest soft, or that he should not. she knew she wished mrs. gregory to have the hundred dollars. there was no doubt on that point. then uncle william spoke."
367,6000-55211-0001.flac," billy, are you very busy this morning? no indeed not if you want me. well i do my dear, uncle williams' voice was troubled. i want you to go with me if you can to see a mrs. gregory. she's got a teapot i want."
368,6000-55211-0058.flac," come, billy. will bid you good morning, ladies,"" said william henshaw, then decisively. and billy, with a little wistful pat on mrs. gregory's clasp tans, went. once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk,"
369,6000-55211-0006.flac," why, how funny! well, i'll come. i'll come. i'll come. at 11 you say, at park street? yes, and thank you, my dear. i tried to get kate to go, too, but she wouldn't. by the way, i'm going to bring you home to luncheon. kate leaves this afternoon, you know."
370,6000-55211-0043.flac, he will give us $100. i got the girl faintly.
371,6000-55211-0019.flac," though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke. the lowest-staffed? yes, i'm so glad. that is, of course, i must be glad. i'll get it. her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair."
372,6000-55211-0025.flac," you'll find them quite perfect, i think. perfect. i should say they were, cried the man. you man. they are then valuable? mrs. gregory's voice shook. indeed, they are, but you must know that."
373,6000-55211-0018.flac," a curious expression, or rather series of expressions crossed mrs. gregory's face. terror, joy, dismay, and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy. relief in the end conquered."
374,6000-55211-0007.flac," and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought bethes to try to get over to the house. maybe aunt hannah would come too for luncheon, would she? i'm afraid not, return billy with a roofalaf. she's got three shawls on this morning."
375,6000-55211-0039.flac," nielsen supplied the man as she looked at billy and hesitated. a swift red stained alice gregory's face. with barely an acknowledgement of the introductions she turned to her mother. yes dear, but that won't be necessary now."
376,6000-55211-0002.flac," it's a genuine lowest-off, tarlo says. will you go? of-you go? of course i will. what time? 11 if you can, park street. she's at the west end."
377,6000-55211-0059.flac," william henshadur along, henshadur along, henshadur along, breath. well, bye, jov. billy, the next time i take you curio hunting, it won't be to this place. he fumed. wasn't it awful? choked billy? awful."
378,6000-55211-0016.flac," mrs. gregory had seated herself now, and william henshaugh had cleared his throat nervously."
379,6000-55211-0023.flac," with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation. the collector reached for the teapot. his eyes sparkled. billy looked what a beauty, and it's a lowest off, too, the real thing, the genuine true soft paste."
380,6000-55211-0060.flac," the girl was the most-most-most stubborn, unreasonable, vixenish little pus i ever saw. i didn't want her old loa-stopped if she didn't want to sell it. but to practically invite me there, then treat me like that. sculled the collector, his face growing red with anger."
381,6000-55211-0011.flac," she finished just above her breath. mrs. gregory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four- four- she four flights of stairs, up which william hensha toiled with increasing weariness and in dismay, punctuating each flight with a despairing"
382,6000-55211-0040.flac," as i started to tell you when i came in, i have two new pupils, and so, turning to the man again, i thank you for your offer, but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present."
383,6000-55211-0055.flac," but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy. mrs. gregory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet, and with the choking, dear child, she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own."
384,6000-55211-0026.flac," i have been told so. yet, to me their chief value of course lies in their association. my mother and my- association. my mother and my- association. my mother and my grandmother own that teapot, sir. again her voice broke. william pennshaw cleared his throat."
385,6000-55211-0048.flac," do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life? a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living, not merely existing? alice!"
386,6000-55211-0015.flac," mckenna, lily, she had taken the chair toward which mrs. gregory had motioned her. she had tried not to seem to look about her, but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain."
387,6000-55211-0052.flac," you are very kind, mr. hensha, but i do not think we care to sell the lowest off today. both words and manner were obviously a dismissal, and with a puzzled sigh, william hensha picked up his hat. his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do."
388,6000-55211-0028.flac," then that it will bring in money and we need money. she threw a quick glance toward the hall door, though she did not pause in her remarks. i can't do much at work that pays. i so, she nodded toward the machine by the window."
389,6000-55211-0014.flac, both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one. billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay.
390,6000-55211-0010.flac, nonsense uncle william. of course you won't turn back.
391,8975-270782-0096.flac," infantile side of psychic life, which we may find in action in children, which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions, partly because it is lightly considered, since we demand no ethical heights of the child."
392,8975-270782-0103.flac," which, however, disclosed only the beginnings of new riddles, new doubts. first, through regression of dreamwork is not only formal, it is also of greater import. it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression,"
393,8975-270782-0082.flac," under the pressure of education. he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes, rather a credit to both the same genital formation."
394,8975-270782-0102.flac," and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream, we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature. as a result of the whole investigation, we grasp two facts."
395,8975-270782-0093.flac," and most customary choice, and that not until later is there any resistance, the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology."
396,8975-270782-0091.flac," the most monstrous efforts have been made to explain the... efforts have been made to explain the... efforts have been made to explain the sphere of incest. some have believed that it is due to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature, which is psychically represented by this prohibition, because inbreeding would deteriorate the race character."
397,8975-270782-0086.flac," and then at the writing table defend the sexual purity of the same children. where children are left to themselves or are under the influence of corruption,"
398,8975-270782-0094.flac, toward the understanding of the dream. we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream.
399,8975-270782-0087.flac," of perverse sexual activity. to be sure, the grownups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances, as play. for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable, either before the bar of custom or before the law."
400,8975-270782-0083.flac," toward those persons closest to him, and who are dear to him for various reasons. his parents, brothers and sisters, nurses. and finally, you may observe in him that which later breaks through again, raised now to a love attraction."
401,8975-270782-0113.flac," what is the use of giving new life to old, long-outgrown, psychic stimuli, wishes, and character types? that is, why i-i-i-i-the material regression, in addition to the formal. the only satisfactory answer would be this."
402,8975-270782-0077.flac," thus, we are moved to study the development of sex life in the child also, and we discover the following from a number of sources. in the first place, it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual life, and to take it for granted,"
403,8975-270782-0108.flac, the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication
404,8975-270782-0111.flac," which shall differentiate it from the- it from the- it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile. we may, to be sure, propound the question, what forces the psychological- does the psychological activity during sleep to such regression?"
405,8975-270782-0107.flac, how does one solve this contradiction? we begin to see that a distinction must be made. something that originates in our conscious life and that shares its characteristics
406,8975-270782-0088.flac," but these things do exist. they have their significance, indications of innate characteristics, as well as causes and furtherances of later developments. they give us an insight into childhood sex life, and thereby into the sex life of man."
407,8975-270782-0100.flac, are shamed and angry if one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form.
408,8975-270782-0085.flac, and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business. the whole business. these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child.
409,8975-270782-0104.flac," but it re-awakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life. the ancient predominance of the ego, the earliest impulses of our sexual life, even our old intellectual property."
410,8975-270782-0076.flac," by applying our former researchers to the study of the psyche, life of the child, we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden dream wishes of excessive sexual impulses may be explained in the same manner."
411,8975-270782-0105.flac," unconscious is no longer a name for what is that time latent. the unconscious is an a special, special, special psychic realm with wish impulses of its own, with its own method of expression, chin, chin, and with a psychic mechanism peculiar to itself."
412,8975-270782-0112.flac," why do not the sleep-disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it? and if they must, and if they must, and if they must, because of the dream censorship, disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible,"
413,8975-270782-0109.flac," between these two parts, the dream work completes itself. the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious necessitates regression. this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream."
414,8975-270782-0092.flac," others may say that because of having lived together since early childhood, the sexual desire is diverted from the person's under consideration. in both cases furthermore, the incestive avoidance would be automatically assured."
415,8975-270782-0090.flac," those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters. you know what in tipethy society fields toward such intercourse, or at least pretends to feel. and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it?"
416,8975-270782-0081.flac," he knows no unbridgeable chasm between man and animal. the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition. in the beginning, he is not disgusted at the sight of experiment, but slowly learns to be so disgusted."
417,8975-270782-0079.flac," but we call perverse in the life of an adult differs from the normal in the following respects. first, in disregard for the dividing line of species, the gulf between man and animal. second,"
418,8975-270782-0084.flac," polymorph, parchus, perverse. and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses, of all these impulses, it is on the one hand because of their lesser intensity as compared to later life, and on the other hand,"
419,8975-270782-0097.flac," since the dream regresses to this stage, it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us. but it is only a deceptive appearance by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened. we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams."
420,8975-270782-0095.flac," with all its peculiarities, its egoism, its incestuous love choice, etc. continues for the purposes of the dream in the unconscious."
421,8975-270782-0089.flac," when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses, it means only that the dream has in this field."
422,8975-270782-0078.flac," that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty. on the contrary, the child has, from the very beginning, a sexual life, rich in content, and differing in numerous respects."
423,8975-270782-0101.flac, as we would be if we understood it. if we understood it. if we understood it. just think of the scandalized opinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of services of love. the problem is not yet solved.
424,8975-270782-0110.flac," that we are able to attain without having searched through further psychic realms. the time will soon come, however, when we shall clothe the unconscious character of the latent dream thought with another name."
425,8975-270782-0106.flac," but the latent dream thoughts, which we have solved by means of the dream interpretation, are not of this realm. they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours. still, they are unconscious."
426,8975-270782-0099.flac, but being reasonable is only a part of psychic life. many things are taking place there that are not reasonable. and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams. and unreasonably. we turn them over to the dream censorship.
427,8975-270782-0080.flac," being insensible to the conventional feeling of disgust, third, the incest limitation, being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction with near-blood relations, fourth, homosexuality, and fifth,"
428,8975-270782-0114.flac, that only in this manner can a dream be built up.
429,8975-270782-0098.flac," if the evil impulses of the dream are merely in phantomism, or returned to the beginnings of our ethical development, since the dream simply makes children of us again, in thinking and in feeling, we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable."
430,8975-270782-0075.flac," who were so fortunate as to escape and later life these conflicts with their parents, and intimately associated with what we call the kestration complex. the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father"
431,8975-270782-0054.flac," and disclose a tendency to separate those of the same sex, daughter from mother, father from son. the daughter finds in her mother the authority that hens in her will, and that is entrusted with the task of causing her to carry out"

437,8975-270782-0069.flac," but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child. and one tends rather to underestimate, then to overestimate its influence, and the developments which may follow from it. in addition,"

439,8975-270782-0070.flac," children frequently react to the edipous idea through stimulation by the parents. who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences, so that the father prefers the daughter, the mother, the son."

443,8975-270782-0056.flac," to the sun, the father is the embodiment of every social, statement of every social restriction, born with such great opposition. the father bars the way to freedom of will, to early sexual satisfaction,"
444,8975-270782-0067.flac," ideas which we designate as the etappis complex. because this myth realizes with a very slightly weakened effect, the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the sun, to kill his father and take his mother to wife."
445,8975-270782-0035.flac," which most frequently can be traced back to the un, which to the un, which to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer."

447,8975-270782-0037.flac," we have wandered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature, and certainly we're not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result, the alt of dream interpretation, without question. after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past,"
448,8975-270782-0017.flac," beautiful examples of this occur in literature, and i myself can present such an example. i once dreamed in a certain connection of a person, of a person who must have performed some service for me, and who my clearly saw. he was a one-eyed man, short and stature, stout,"
449,8975-270782-0019.flac," and i learned from her that he had one eye, was short and stout, with his head sunk into his neck, and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me. this control over the forgotten material of childhood years"
450,8975-270782-0009.flac," nor is there any reason for considering the memory function as a particularly high or difficult psychic performance. in fact, the contrary is true. and you can find a good memory in persons who stand very low intellectually."
451,8975-270782-0060.flac," rather than that this task should be left to the senate. in any event, this denial refers only to actual life. the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal."
452,8975-270782-0051.flac," this is in accord with our expectation. we find it much more offensive for love between parents and children to be lacking than for love between brothers and sisters. we have, so to speak, made something holy in the first instance."
453,8975-270782-0005.flac," in this connection, it appears to me, for example, that the symbolic relations which the individual has never learned"
454,8975-270782-0062.flac," as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings, in example 3, it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship. much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses."
455,8975-270782-0014.flac," by means of careful analysis, one is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten."

457,8975-270782-0042.flac," often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling, or rather let us say, glossed over. but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier. it is most notable in children of from two and one half"
458,8975-270782-0071.flac," and this love is substituted for the outhorn love. one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the adipis complex. on the contrary, it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults."
459,8975-270782-0072.flac," and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this and hurt in denying this prescribed, or tabooed feeling relationship, later made good the omission, made good the omission, made good the omission by taking all value from the complex and taking all value from the complex through false interpretations. according to my unchanged conviction,"

463,8975-270782-0027.flac," indeed, translated this wish into various actions, happily harmless. the later death wish against some love one, which seems so strange, also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person."
464,8975-270782-0021.flac," when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli, which gave rise to dreams, were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires, which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary. after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he, he,"

466,8975-270782-0049.flac," if there is anyone who hates a young english lady, more than does her mother. it is her elder sister. there is something about this saying, however, that arouses our antipathy. we can, at a pinch, understand hatred of brothers and sisters."
467,8975-270782-0034.flac," that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator, and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past. let us continue with the removal or death wish."

469,8975-270782-0047.flac," we need seldom-finding puzzling, and may trace its origin easily to early childhood, often enough, also to the propinquity of later years. probably no nurseries are free from mighty conflicts among the inhabitants."
470,8975-270782-0065.flac," especially between persons of the same sex, has already made its influence felt in earliest childhood. i mean the love rivalry, with the special emphasis of the sex character. the sun, even as a small child,"
471,8975-270782-0011.flac," our memory deals selectively with its later materials. with impressions which come to us in later life, it retains the important and discards the unimportant. this is not true of the retained childhood memories."
472,8975-270782-0015.flac," and in so far as the cure is to any degree successful, successful, we are able again to bring to light the content of the childhood years, thus clouded in forgetfulness. these impressions have never really been per capita. they have only been inaccessible, latent."

475,8975-270782-0012.flac," they do not be speak necessarily important experiences of childhood, not even such as from the viewpoint of the child need a peer of importance. they are often so banal and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves in wonder why just these details"
476,8975-270782-0010.flac," i must point out that certain well-preserved memories, for the most part, formatively, i experienced, stand forth in this memory void, which surrounds the first years of childhood, and do not justify this hypothesis."
477,8975-270782-0038.flac," or real remnants thereof, show themselves. for the child loves itself first, and later learns to love others, to sacrifice something of its ego for another."
478,8975-270782-0007.flac, that of a gap in the memory is far more frequent. i believe we have not laid enough stress on this fact. the child is able to speak well at the age of two. it soon shows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic situations.
479,8975-270782-0003.flac," but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken. the antiquity into which the dream work carries a spack is of a double aspect. firstly, the individual antiquity, childhood, and secondly, insofar as every individual in his childhood,"
480,8975-270782-0020.flac, is then a further archaic tendency of the dream. the same information may be made use of in another of the puzzles that have presented themselves to us. you will recall how astonished people were.
481,8975-270782-0048.flac," the motives are rivalry for the love of the parents, article-zoned in common, the room itself. the hostile impulses are called forth by older, as well as younger brothers and sisters."

483,8975-270782-0058.flac, the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistic considerations. why do i speak of these things so banal and so well known?
484,8975-270782-0059.flac," because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny significance in life, and to set forth the ideal, for the ideal demanded by society, as a fulfilled thing, much oftener than it really is fulfilled. but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth."
485,8975-270782-0028.flac," this wish was no stranger to him. while the child was still a suckling, this man, then, and who was unhappy in his choice of a wife, often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die, he would die, he would again be free, and would make better use of his freedom."
486,8975-270782-0068.flac," i do not wish to maintain that the edifice complex covers entirely the relation of the child to its parents. this relation can be much more complicated. it's more complicated. it's more complicated. furthermore, the edifice complex is more or less well developed. it may even experience a reversal."

488,8975-270782-0045.flac," if the difference in age is less, the child learns of the existence of the rival with intense psychic activity, and accommodates himself to the new situation. if the difference in age is greater, the new child may awaken certain sympathies as an age."

639,8468-294887-0012.flac," which was held in brooklyn for the benefit of the committee. although lately afflicted by disease, mr. tappen still lives in the enjoyment of all his faculties and a good measure of health."
640,8468-294887-0038.flac," and he warned the people not to bid for him, for he would no longer be a slave to any man, and if anyone bought him, he would lose his money. he added, i thought it right to say this. i then spoke to the crowd."
641,8468-294887-0021.flac," but reflection convinced them that it was not only right to assist men in efforts to obtain their liberty, when unjustly held in bondage, but a duty. abolitionists, white and colored both in slave and free states."
642,8468-294887-0014.flac," instead, stands up in all our southern states, states, states, states, the freed man, knowing his rights, and as a rule in joining them. original american abolitionists, who met the scorn and odium, the imputed shame and obliquely,"
643,8468-294887-0025.flac, and by different agencies to canada. 2.
644,8468-294887-0004.flac," on the occasion of the return of the amestad captors to the native land, and now doing so much for the freedmen of the south was almost entirely established by his efforts. during the continuance of slavery much was done by this society."
645,8468-294887-0041.flac," that with the aid of a brown wig, after he had cut off his hair, he was completely disguised. he soon notified his brother who lived in another part of the city, and both put themselves out of harm's way."
646,8468-294887-0020.flac," which may afford you and your readers some gratification. these facts i must give without reference to date as i will not tax my memory with perhaps a vain attempt to narrate them in order. as mentioned in my life of arthur tappen,"
647,8468-294887-0037.flac," on being put upon the auction block, this young man addressed the bystanders and told them the circumstances of the case. that his mother had long lived in the family of the doctor, that it was cruel to sell her and her children."
648,8468-294887-0008.flac," but hearing that there were a few loaded muskets there, they took it out in threats. but their mercantile establishment was almost ostracized at this time by the dry goods merchants."
649,8468-294887-0001.flac," these agents were entertained by abolitionists in the city, and many of us had two or three of them in each of our families for a couple of weeks."
650,8468-294887-0006.flac," as we almost always had some of the travelers toward the north star present, whose masters or their agents were frequently in the city, in hot pursuit. at first we sent them to canada, but after a while sent them only to syracuse and the center of the state."
651,8468-294887-0029.flac," most of the teachers were warm-hearted abolitionists, and the whole number taught in the school during this period was 7 or 800."
652,8468-294887-0009.flac," and when they did so, requested particularly that the bundles or boxes should not be marked from a-tap and end company, as was customary. southern merchants especially avoided them."
653,8468-294887-0016.flac," and especially in the vigilance committee for many years, from serious affection of his eyes."
654,8468-294887-0022.flac," those who had money contributed it freely, and those who were destitute of money, gave their time, saying with the apostle, silver and gold have i none, but such as i have, give i thee."" 1."
655,8468-294887-0040.flac," and are now both in the city. i am a blacksmith and have worked six months in one shop in new york, and new york, new york, with white journeymen, not one of whom believes i suppose that i am a colored man. and then, it was not surprising for sulfair was his complexion."
656,8468-294887-0017.flac," mr. tappin was therefore requested to furnish a few reminiscences from his own storehouse, which she kindly did as follows."
657,8468-294887-0013.flac," and in his advanced years, sees now some of the great results of his lifelong efforts for the restoration and maintenance of human rights. although still suffering under many of the evils which slavery has inflicted upon him, the american slave no longer exists."

659,8468-294887-0002.flac," they went out all over the land and were instrumental in diffusing more truth perhaps about the dreadful system of american slavery than was accomplished in any other way. he also aided in establishing several periodicals, brimful of anti-slavery truth."
660,8468-294887-0030.flac," to my inquiry, have you parents living and also brothers and sisters? she replied, there is no child, there is no child but myself. were not your parents kind to you and did you not love them? yes, i love them very much."
661,8468-294887-0031.flac," how were you treated by your master and mistress? they treated me very well. how then said i, could you put yourself in the care of that sailor, who was a stranger to you and leave your parents? i shall never forget her heartfelt reply."
662,8468-294887-0007.flac," in 1834, i think was the first riot, rioting the sacking of mr. tappen's house in rose street. the mob brought all his furniture out and piling it up in the street, set it on fire. the family were absent at the time."
663,8468-294887-0034.flac," i wrote notices to be read in the colored churches and colored sabbath schools which i delivered in person. i then went to the colored school, superintendent."
664,8468-294887-0003.flac," among which were the anti-slavery record, the emancipator, the slave's friend, the latter to indoctrinate the children in anti-slavery. the american missionary society originally begun for the support of a mission in africa"
665,8468-294887-0000.flac," and with a few others devoted the most of the sabbath to their teaching. when he and his brother arthur assembled the 70 anti-slavery agents, who were thereafter, like firebrands, scattered all over the land, they held their meetings in this room."
666,8468-294887-0019.flac," to write such an article as would be worthy of your publication, to worthy of your publication. however, feeling somewhat relieved today from my paralysis, owing to the cheering sunshine and the favor of my almighty preserver, i will try to do what i can in dictating a few anecdotes to my emanueunces."
667,8468-294887-0010.flac," and when two or three years later, there was a general insolvency among them, occasionally large losses to new york merchants and in some york merchants and in some york merchants and in some cases failure. the tapens were saved by having no southern debts."
668,8468-286673-0011.flac," the first year i had only a few children. the next year i had more. and so it is gone. so it is gone. every year a few more children than the year before. until, i never know quite how many i do have. but there is always one slow little turtle."
669,8468-286673-0012.flac," who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him? who... that makes him miss his ship, who's share of good things, and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is who... somebody else's fault. the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers position on his right side, looking at him out of their left eyes."
670,8468-286673-0028.flac," he was thinking over and over. something has happened, something has happened. and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not. the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass."
671,8468-286673-0001.flac," the mother turtle who was sending herself on the bank nearby said to her friends, why, there are my children. did you ever see a finer family? i believe i will go over and speak to them."
672,8468-286673-0005.flac," you certainly are, for i saw you scrambling out of—you're rambling out of—rambling out of the sand a little while ago. and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year. i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch."
673,8468-286673-0024.flac, she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck. when she heard a splash and saw her to splash and saw her to splash and saw two terrible great two-legged animals waiting into the pond from the shore. boys! she cried cried cried. boys! and she sprawled off the end of her log.
674,8468-286673-0000.flac," the slow, little mud turtle. when the 20 little mud turtles broke their eggshells one hot summer day, and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried, they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops."
675,8468-286673-0034.flac," and again, he fell fast asleep."
676,8468-286673-0002.flac," and then sat down until it should stop aching. wait for me, he called out to his brothers and sisters. i'm coming in a minute! the other little turtles waited, but when his toe was comfortable again, and he started toward them, he met a very interesting snail."
677,8468-286673-0016.flac," i remember her so well my first slow child, and how he, she began to cry, and since she could not easily get her four feet to her eyes, she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water."
678,8468-286673-0027.flac," next, the other great animal took him and turned him over and wrapped on his shells and stared at him."
679,8468-286673-0004.flac," and not at all too close. then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand, with a rather cross look in his hand, with a rather cross look in his eyes, and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to. quite as though he were out of patience about something. why didn't you turtles wait for me?"
680,8468-286673-0038.flac," he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them. and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit, he said to the turtles who had always lived there."
681,8468-286673-0035.flac," but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also. he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky. when he did open his eyes, his relatives were sitting around looking at him, and he remembered all that had happened before he slept."
682,8468-286673-0036.flac," does my shell look very bad? he cried. i wish i could see it. oh, i'm so glad to get back. i'll never be slow again. never, never. his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his."
683,8468-286673-0019.flac," and these cousins of the turtles, and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them, that some people cannot tell them apart. that is because they f- and is because they forget that the tortoises live on land, have higher backshells, and move very, very slowly. turtles live more in the water."
684,8468-286673-0007.flac," why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters?"" she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle, who was trying to make a place for himself on the log. they didn't wait for me, he said. i was coming right along, but they wouldn't wait. i think they are just as meat."
685,8468-286673-0003.flac," and talked a while with him. come on, little while with him. come on,"" said the biggest little turtle. don't let's wait any longer, he can catch up. so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log, and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together."
686,8468-286673-0009.flac, i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait. it is too bad.
687,8468-286673-0013.flac," and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side, looking at him out of their right eyes. he drew in his head and his tail and his legs, until all they could see was his rounded upper shell, his shell sidewalls, and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell."
688,8468-286673-0017.flac," the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said, and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others. nothing happened to him, and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them."
689,8468-286673-0030.flac," this did not really give him pain, yet as he said afterward, it hurts almost as much to think you're going to be hurt, as it does to be hurt, as it does to be hurt, as it does to be hurt. it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go."
690,8468-286673-0025.flac," and slid into the water. all her friends, and all her friends following her. the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him. he blew him. he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water. and all his brothers and sisters followed him, except the slow little turtle."
691,8468-286673-0010.flac," yet down in his little turtle heart, he thought, now they are going to catch it. he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him. he wanted to see what they would do. so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side."
692,8468-286673-0008.flac," the mother turtle raised one of her four feet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him. she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her. so you are the one, she said."
693,8468-286673-0039.flac," he is the quickest one in his family. the pond people looked at each other and laughed. that is queer, they said. after this we will call him the quick little turtle. this made him very happy, and when once in a while somebody forgot."
694,8468-286673-0029.flac," he lay perfectly still for a long, long time. and when he thought they had forgotten about him, he tried to run away. then they laughed and picked him up again, and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell."
695,8468-286673-0020.flac," and can move quickly if they will. this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise. and... and... one beautiful, sun-shiny afternoon, when most of the 20 little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond."
696,8468-286673-0021.flac," their mother, their mother, their mother was with some of her friends on another log nearby. she looked often at her children, and thought how handsome their rounded up backshells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black."
697,8468-286673-0031.flac," then he was very, very tired, but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight. this was the first time he had ever seen the moon, for except when they are laying eggs, turtles usually sleep at night."
698,8468-286673-0026.flac," then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up, and held him bottom side up her most and wrapped on that side, which was flat, and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes."
699,8468-286673-0006.flac, the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well. mother turtle stretched her head this way in that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neck skin. she was so eager to see them all.
700,8468-286673-0015.flac," and you, she added turning to his brothers and sisters, must be patient with him. we shall not have him with us long."
701,8468-286673-0033.flac," i'm here, he cried joyfully, poking first one, and then another of them with his head. the biggest little turtle moved without awakening. i tell you i'm not hungry, he murmured."
702,8468-286673-0023.flac," yes, set a fine old fellow who was floating near her. a row of their mothers. he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well, but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all."
703,8468-286673-0014.flac," i did hope,"" said the mother turtle, that i might have one family without such a child in it. i cannot help loving even a slow child who was cross. if he is hatched from one of my eggs, yet it makes me sad. very, very sad."
704,8468-286673-0037.flac," if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters, she said, i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off. you just wait and see,"" said the slow little turtle. and he was as good as his word. after that,"
705,8468-286673-0022.flac," she could see their strong little, strong little pointed tails too, and their web feet with a stout claw on each toe. she was so proud that she could not help talking about them."
706,8468-286673-0032.flac, i wish i might help you sometime.
707,8468-286673-0018.flac," or because he wanted to do this, or look at that, or talk to some other person. he was a very trying little turtle, yet his mother loved him, and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise. it is all right, you know, to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises."
708,8468-286673-0040.flac, and by mistake call him the quick slow little turtle.
709,831-130746-0049.flac," what we had best to be doing, you were tired, you were tired, you know, and we can't wander all night after the day we've had. that was chichester we were near, she asked, if he meditated with a tremble in his voice."
710,831-130746-0038.flac," she, who has spiritualized the world, alone safe for two attendant steady-shinding stars. and in silence, under her benign influence, under the benediction of her light, rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night."
711,831-130746-0008.flac," after a pause, beckamel went back to the dining room, they heard a chair creak under him, interlude of conversational eyebrows. i'm going up, said stephen, to break the melon and call the news to him. beckamel looked up from a weak old newspaper."
712,831-130746-0058.flac," white to misunderstanding said hoop driver with splendid reddenus, dienus, dienus. my sister had gone to bogdnor, but i-nor, but i brought her back here. i took a fancy to this place, place, place, and the moon lights simply divine. we've had supper thanks, and we're tired,"" said mr. hoop driver."
713,831-130746-0042.flac," ""'you are safe,' said mr. hoop driver, sweeping off his cap with an air of bowing courtly, courtly. ""'where are we?' ""'safe.' ""'but where?' chichester harbor, he waived his arm's seaworth as though it was a goal. do you think they will follow us?'"
714,831-130746-0032.flac," at a footfall, at a roughness in the road, at a she seemed to be too intent upon the scape to give much thought to him."
715,831-130746-0043.flac," we have turned and turned again. it seemed a hoop driver that he heard her sob. she stood dimly there, holding her machine, and he, holding his, could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath."
716,831-130746-0027.flac," hube driver had, hup, hup, hup, cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born. had beckmell arisen in the way with rapiers, hup, hup, with rapiers, with rapiers for a duel, hube driver had fought as one to whom agend court was a reality and drapery of dream."
717,831-130746-0030.flac," then, amidst vila's again, vila's again, some warm and lamplet, some white and sleeping in the moonlight, then between hedges over which they saw broad, one meadows shrouded in a low-lying mist."
718,831-130746-0055.flac," almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes. it was, as i have indicated, the hour and season of the full moon."
719,831-130746-0024.flac," the wretched creature has already sufficiently solid our modest but truthful, full pages. we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vikuna hotel. we leave all bognor as we have left all chinchester."
720,831-130746-0017.flac," stephen was too surprised to say anything, but… bourbon, sir? go on, sid beckmilk. damn you! stephen sympathies changed at once. yes, sir, he murmured, fumbling for the door handle, and left the room marvelling."
721,831-130746-0022.flac," i, beckmell, went with an abrupt tap in prompt opening of the door, stephen entered with the bourbon."
722,831-130746-0033.flac," his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position. the night was warm, white silence, say for the subtle running of their chains."
723,831-130746-0005.flac," incredulous eyes stare into one another, into one another, into one another's in the bar, as his paces muffled by the stare carpet, went up to the landing, turned, reached the passage, and walked into the dining room overhead."
724,831-130746-0056.flac," and it was chiefly by good luck, and the fact that most roads about a town converged sh- there upon, that chitchester was at last detained. it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed, but the red- and- but the red- and- but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm."
725,831-130746-0029.flac," he had seen her troubled, and her eyes bright with tears. but what light is there lighting? he light is there lighting. light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the mid-summer moon. the road turned north, road turned northward, going round through the outskirts of bognor."
726,831-130746-0046.flac," prum's to help and protect me. i was unhappy at home. never mind what. why? a stepmother. i'd all unoccupied, hindered, cramped. that is enough for her. prum's. then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire."
727,831-130746-0026.flac," how their hearts beat together and their breath, how breath came fast, and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursued. for all that flight, mr. hoop driver was in the world of romance. had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit."
728,831-130746-0054.flac," she said, with a laugh to break the intensity, he opened his mouth and shut it again, and with the sudden winsing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine. she looked down at him."
729,831-130746-0059.flac," i suppose you won't take anything, jesse. the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jesse like that, but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit. good night, sis, he said, and pleasant dreams."
730,831-130746-0047.flac," to be a human being, not a thing in a hutch, and he, i know, said hoop driver, and now here i am. i will do anything, said hoop driver, she thought. you cannot imagine my stepmother. no, i could not describe her."
731,831-130746-0020.flac," nicker-bockers went frisking across his mind again, and he reverted to his blasphemies. he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit, and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths."
732,831-130746-0050.flac," you would make me your brother, miss beaumont? yes. we could stop there together. she took him in to answer. i'm going to light these lamps, said hoop driver. he bent down to his own, and struck a match on his shoe."
733,831-130746-0014.flac," then, with infinite fervor, he said, but let us put in blank cartridge, he said, i might have thought, thought, thought."" he flung himself into the armchair, damn hurt, said beckham hill, for all the world like a common man."
734,831-130746-0051.flac," grave and intent. how could she ever have thought him, have thought him common or absurd? but she must tell me your name, brother,"" she said. her, carrington, said mr. hoop driver after a momentary pause."
735,831-130746-0019.flac," and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable, after all, that the girl had escaped through her stepmother, in which case the business might be hushed up yet, and the evil hour of explanation with his wife and with his wife indefinitely postponed."
736,831-130746-0025.flac," and midhurst and hazelmere and gildford and ripply and andly and puttany, and follow this dear fool of a hoop-triver of ours, and his young laden grey out upon the moonlit road. how they rode,"
737,831-130746-0018.flac," she had evidently gone off with him, and that little business was over, and he was here, stranded, and sold."
738,831-130746-0037.flac," white dust, hot underfoot, blinding to the eye, is now a soft gray silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlight, and its silver here and there. overhead, riding serenely through the spacious blue, is the mother of the silence."
739,831-130746-0060.flac, but this was living indeed. he told himself.
740,831-130746-0045.flac," he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic. it's an ugly name, he said, but you are right in trusting me. i would. i would do anything for you. this."
741,831-130746-0007.flac," they listened together. his- they listened together. his feet stomped, turned. went out of the dining room, down the passage to the bedroom, stopped again. poor chap, said the barmaid. she's a wicked woman. shhh, shhh, sits even."
742,831-130746-0028.flac," it was rescue, allopment, glory. it was rescue, allopment, glory. it was rescue, allopment, glory. and she, by the side of him, he had seen her face in shadow."
743,831-130746-0039.flac," no, where was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mr. hoop driver's skull? at the at the turnings of the road he made his decision with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard. the right, he would say, or again."
744,831-130746-0035.flac," and now they face northwards, and the soft cold light past caressingly over her hair and touched her brow in cheek. there is a magic quality in moonshine. it touches all that is sweet and beautiful, and the rest of the night is hidden."
745,831-130746-0057.flac, but that night he was in the mood to dare anything. so you found your young lady at last said the off-sler of the red hotel?
746,831-130746-0000.flac," the ostler, being a fool, rushed violently down the road, vociferating after them. then he returned, panting to the vekuna hotel, and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up. stopped to give them the cream of the adventure."
747,831-130746-0034.flac, he looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankle gracefully ruling the trebles. now the road turned westward and she was a dark gray outline against the shimmer of the moon.
748,831-130746-0015.flac," i'll check this in furnal business. they've gone, eh? yes, sir. yes, sir. yes, sir."
749,831-130746-0040.flac," the left, as one who knew. so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea."
750,831-130746-0048.flac," i am entirely at your service. i will help you with all my power. power. i have lost an illusion and found a knight-errant."" she spoke of beckmuff. beckmuff. as the illusion. mr. hoop driver felt flattered, but he had no adequate answer."
751,831-130746-0013.flac," but as yet he seemed to merely stunned. «brown clothes,» he said, and ferrish? «a little like yourself, sir, in the dark. the oscillars, sir, jim duke."
752,831-130746-0036.flac," it has created the fairies, whom the sunlight kills. and fairyland rises again, rises again, rises again in our hearts at the sight of it, the voices of the filmy root."
753,831-130746-0053.flac, the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely. she had to speak.
754,831-130746-0012.flac," another gentleman, who? another gentleman in browns, sir, went into the yard, sir, got out the two bicycles, sir, and went off, sir, about twenty minutes ago. becknell stood with his eyes round and his knuckles on his hips."
755,831-130746-0010.flac," if so, he was in for next explanation, but he had it ready. she was a monomaniac. leave me alone with her, he would say. i know how to calm her."" mrs. beaumont, said stephen. well, has gone."
756,831-130746-0004.flac," making a sudden an austric in silence appeared beckamo in the hall beyond the bar, walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and pasted out of sight. you can see the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium."
757,831-130746-0041.flac," hello, submistor hoop driver, sadovoko. they dismounted abruptly, stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight. that was tangled in the hedge on either side."
758,831-130746-0011.flac," he rose with a fine surprise. gone, he said. gone, he said. he said. with a half-bluff. gone, sir, on her bicycle. on her bicycle, why? she went, sir, with another gentleman. this time beckamel was really startled."
759,831-130746-0006.flac," it wasn't that one at all, miss,"" said the osler, i'd swear. well, that's mr. bohlwant, said the barmaid. anyhow, their conversation hung comatose in the air, switched up by beckmo."
760,831-130746-0031.flac," they scarcely heated withered they rode at first, being only anxious to get away, turning once westward, when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them, out of the duly night, pale and intricate and high."
761,831-130746-0002.flac, there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions. there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse. that made ten minutes.
762,831-130746-0001.flac," that gave the fugitives five minutes. then pushing breathlessly into the bar, he had to make it clear to the bar maid what the matter was, and the governor being out, they spent some more precious time wondering, whatever was to be done."
763,831-130746-0023.flac, the moonlight ride. and so the 20 minutes law passed into an infinity.
764,831-130746-0016.flac," making a memorable saying, let him go, who cares, and i wish him luck, and bring me some bourbon as fast as you can. there's a good job."
765,831-130746-0021.flac," he banged the arms of the chair with his fists, arms of the chair with his fists, and swore again."
766,831-130746-0044.flac," are you tired?"" he asked. i will do what has to be done. the two black figures in the broken light were silent for a pace. do you know, she said, i'm not afraid of you. i am sure you are honest to me."
767,831-130746-0052.flac," who would be hoop driver on a night like this. but the christian name. christian name, my christian name? well, chris. he snapped his lamp and stood up. if you hold my machine, i will light yours,"" he said."
768,831-130746-0003.flac," then, stephen, the waiter, who had shown hoop driver up, came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question, which, that turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour, and in the midst of this discussion,"
769,831-130746-0009.flac," as, without knocking, stephen entered, beckamel's face suggested a different expectation. big pardonser said stephen with a diplomatic cough. well, said beckamel, wondering suddenly if jesse had kept some of her threats."
770,831-130739-0061.flac," hoop driver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it? never oil the steering, it's fatal!"
771,831-130739-0056.flac," was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark. briggs had never been on a cycle in his life, but he fell out hoop drivers in experience and offered such advice as occurred to him. have the machine thoroughly well oiled, said briggs."
772,831-130739-0035.flac," agasping, grunting, a shouting of... like... like... steer man, steer! a wavering, unsteady flight. a spasmatic turning of the missile edifice of man in machine, and a collapse. then you discry dimly through the dusk."
773,831-130739-0058.flac," save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe, and then break out with an entirely different, silly, different set of tips. avoid running over dogs who driver, whatever you do."
774,831-130739-0041.flac," the assistant is dreaming of the delicious time only four hours off now, when he will resume the tale of his bruises and abrasions. the apprentice is nearer the long, long thoughts of boyhood and his imagination writes, kap-ap-ai"
775,831-130739-0049.flac," the next in the strict scale of precedence of the draperium phorium. mr. hoopdra, thindra, thindra, thindriver, in alternating spasms, anon, straightens his gangum, and anon becomes meditative with his, thimms meditative with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom tooth."
776,831-130739-0054.flac," i'm getting fairly safe upon it now, he told me how. at other times, hoop driver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice, but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity."
777,831-130739-0039.flac," and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins to straighten them punctiliously, and near him is an apprentice, apprentice to the same high calling of draper's assistant."
778,831-130739-0052.flac, said hoop driver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient mustache.
779,831-130739-0053.flac," you stow it, said mr. hoop driver, looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice, hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice, hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice, and suddenly adding an attone of bitter contempt."
780,831-130739-0055.flac," when the gas was turned off for the night, he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arneka into his knee, a new and a very big place and studying a road map of the south of england."
781,831-130739-0046.flac," how about this day, weak? hoop driver becomes rigidly meditative, gripping the corners of his gengum folds in his hands, his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations. fatiions. can he learn to do a weak? that's the question."
782,831-130739-0033.flac," until sherlock is presently explaining, by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old-fashioned affair with a fork instead of a diamond frame, a cushion tire, well worn on the hind wheel,"
783,831-130739-0042.flac," through the chambers of his brain, seeking some nightly quest in honor of that fair, fair, fair lady, the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dressmaking upstairs."
784,831-130739-0057.flac," carry one or two lemons with you, don't tear yourself to death the first day, and sit upright. never lose control of the machine, and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity. you mine those things, and nothing very much can't happen to you, hoop driver, you take my word."
785,831-130739-0048.flac," all draper's have to be, or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty, washability, and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you. the decision comes at last."
786,831-130739-0037.flac," to seek the wholesome delight of exertion and danger and pain, and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies, the man, to which, initial fact, among others, we shall come again in the end."""
787,831-130739-0032.flac," two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in learning, learning, learning, such as one to mind, such as one to mind, such as one to mind expect in a person unused to muscular exercise. blisters on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering rider and so forth."
788,831-130739-0036.flac," thus, even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself, and drive him against all the conditions of his calling against the councils of prudence and the restrictions of his means,"
789,831-130739-0051.flac," i said hoop driver when the question came to him. why cycling, of course. you're never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours day after day, said miss howe of the costume department. i am."
790,831-130739-0059.flac," never let the machine buckle, though as a man killed, only the other day, through his wheelbuckling. don't scorch, don't ride on the footpath, keep your own side of the road, and if you see a tram line, go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county."
791,831-130739-0034.flac," rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road, the road to be explicit, from rohampton to putney hill. and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel."
792,831-130739-0038.flac," but enough of these revelations, the central gear of our story is now going along behind the counter, a draper indeed, with your purchases and his arms, to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be packed by the senior porter and sent to you."
793,831-130739-0062.flac," a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying. and clean the chain daily with black lead, you mine just to few little things like that."
794,831-130739-0045.flac," the shop-walker brings up a parallel to the counter. any particular time when you want your holidays, he asks. hoop driver pulls at his skimpy mustache. no? don't want them too late, sir, of course."
795,831-130739-0044.flac, they're going fairly well sir.
796,831-130739-0043.flac, he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice the burn his hand the apprentice the burn his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
797,831-130739-0040.flac," a ruddy, red haired lad in a very short, tailless black coat and a very high collar who is deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of créton."
798,831-130739-0050.flac," at supper that night, holiday talk held undisputed sway. mr. pritchard spoke of scotland. miss isaacs clamored about the"
799,831-130739-0060.flac," and always laid up before dark. you mind just a few little things like that, hoop driver, and nothing much can't happen to you. you take my word. right you are, said hoop driver. good night old man. good night, said briggs."
800,831-130739-0047.flac," otherwise, briggs will get next week and he will have to wait until september when the weather is often uncertain. he is naturally of a sanguine disposition."
801,831-130739-0027.flac," one might fancy that he had been sitting with—that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery—a thrushing machine, say, or one of those hay-making furries. but sherlock holmes"
802,831-130739-0001.flac, a perfectly fictitious co-by the by of putney on the 14th of august 1895 had turned to the right-hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend.
803,831-130739-0028.flac, would have fancied nothing of the kind.
804,831-130739-0031.flac," for upon every one of them waits the gist of the unexpected trettle, you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and whack you are rubbing your shin, so out of innocence we ripen."
805,831-130739-0025.flac," he had indeed been bumped and battered at an extraordinary number of points, but enough of realistic description is as good as a feast."
806,831-130739-0012.flac, then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view.
807,831-130739-0023.flac, the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvelous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee. so far we may proceed with our details.
808,831-130739-0021.flac," tumid and threatening, proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner, and an unnatural hardness and reddish would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf."
809,831-130739-0019.flac," and so to our revelation, on the interneal aspect of the right ankle of this young man, you would have observed a contusion and an abrasion. in the internal aspect of the left ankle, a contusion also."
810,831-130739-0010.flac," he would have danced about behind the counter, have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you, have put on one side those you selected, extracted a little book with a carbon leaf, and a tinfoil sheet from a fixture."
811,831-130739-0008.flac," hair of a kind of dirty fairness, grayish eyes, and a skimpy immature mustache under his peaked, indeterminate nose. his features were all small, but none ill-shaped. a rosette of pins decorated the lapel of his coat."
812,831-130739-0030.flac," of the concussions attended on that person's hasty, frequently causeless and invariably ill-conceived descents. one large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist."
813,831-130739-0022.flac," and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface, a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points."
814,831-130739-0007.flac," now, if you had noticed anything about him, it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable. he wore the black morning coat, the black t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t, and the speckled grey nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft."
815,831-130739-0009.flac," we could show you something better of course. no trouble, madam. i assure you. such were the simple counters of his intercourse. so i say."
816,831-130739-0005.flac," huckabuck, blankets, dimmity, cratone, linen, calico, are cases in point."
817,831-130739-0024.flac," fired by these discoveries, an investigator might perhaps have presumed his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders, elbows, and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story."
818,831-130739-0026.flac, even in literature one must know where to draw the line. now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shotman
819,831-130739-0018.flac, let us assume something of the scientific spirit that heard almost professional tone of the conscientious realist. let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest where the unemotional
820,831-130739-0004.flac," and making a kind of circular sweep, invited you to step this way. and so, led you behind his can."
821,831-130739-0015.flac," but real literature, as distinguished from anecdote, does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone. literature is revelation. modern literature is indecorious revelation."
822,831-130739-0016.flac," it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen, even at the cost of some blushes, and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story."
823,831-130739-0013.flac," have scribbled it still more flourishing. j.m. all over the document have asked you, if there was nothing more, have stood by you, supposing that you were paying cash, until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change."
824,831-130739-0011.flac," made you owe it a little bill in that weak flourishing hand, being hand peculiar to drapers."
825,831-130739-0020.flac," on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise. on his left chin there were two bruises, one a lead in yellow graduating here and there into purple, and another obviously of a more recent date of a blotchy red."
826,831-130739-0000.flac," the principal character in the story. if you, presuming you are of the set, the princess sets, sets, that does such things, if you had gone into the drapery emporium, which is really only magnificent for shop,"
827,831-130739-0029.flac," considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner, beginner upon the bicycle saddle, and that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent"
828,831-130739-0006.flac," under which happier circumstances you might, if, of an observing, think, think, turn of mind, and not too much of a housewife to be inhuman, have given the central figure of this story less cursory attention."
829,831-130739-0002.flac, you might have been served by the central figure of this story that is now beginning. he would have come forward bowing and swaying.
830,831-130739-0003.flac," what he might have the pleasure of showing you? under certain circumstances, as for instance, hats, baby linen, gloves, silks, lace, or curtains,"
831,831-130739-0014.flac, one glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilities at work all about you.
832,831-130739-0017.flac," the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was, let us face it bravely, this it bravely, the remarkable condition of this young man's legs, let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness."
833,8238-283452-0019.flac," his jest is likely to have more than one point to it. and he can haunt so insidiously, can make himself so at home in his host's study or bedroom that a man actually welcomes a chat with him."
834,8238-283452-0042.flac, show the diversity of the english humor as associated with apparitions and our entertaining and painting in themselves. the cantorville ghost by oscar wilde is one of his best short stories.
835,8238-283452-0021.flac," ghosts not only have appalling, flingly, long memories, but they possess a mean advantage over the living in that they have once been mortal."
836,8238-283452-0007.flac," there are a few instances as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later, but very few. ancient, but very few. ancient, but very few. ancient ghosts were a long-faced lot."
837,8238-283452-0004.flac, while the feminine can be seen through by another woman and thus disarmed. the majority of the comic apparitions curiously enough are masculine. you don't often find women rathed in smiles.
838,8238-283452-0037.flac," there are various english stories of whimsical haunting, some of actual spooks, and some of the hoax type. hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in british as in american literature."
839,8238-283452-0009.flac," indulging in greater freedom. a ghost can call his shade his own now, and exhibit any mood he pleases. even young female rates, demanding latch keys, refused to obey the frowning face of the clock."
840,8238-283452-0043.flac," this travesty on the conventional traditions of the race is preposterously delightful, one of the cleverest ghost stories in our language. zhang well has written engagingly of spooks,"
841,8238-283452-0001.flac," and insisted on a proper show of respectful fear on the part of those whom they honored by haunting. a mortal was expected to rise when a ghost entered the room, and in case he was slow about it,"
842,8238-283452-0023.flac," he laughs at ghosts that aren't experts in efficiency haunting, and he has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of specters. he loves to shake the laugubriest terrors of the past before you."
843,8238-283452-0015.flac," he knows that there's no weapon, no threat in horror, to be compared with ridicule. think what a solemn creature the gothic ghost was."
844,8238-283452-0044.flac, frank arstock gave his to funny spooks with a riotous and laughing pen. the spirit in the in the transferred ghost is impudently deathless and has called up a train of subsequent haunters.
845,8238-283452-0040.flac, till the phantom couple take a liking to each other and decide to let the living vary their dead. this is suggestive of brander matthews earlier and cleverer story of a spectral courtship in the rival ghosts.
846,8238-283452-0013.flac," at best a revenue could only rattle a rusty skeleton, or shake a moldy shroud, or clank a chain, but as mortals cowarded before his demonstrations, he didn't worry."
847,8238-283452-0005.flac, and have shivyl-worsely spared the gentler shades. and there are very few funny child ghosts. you might almost say none in comparison with the number of grown-ups.
848,8238-283452-0030.flac," in the older fiction and drama, emma apparition spoke seldom."
849,8238-283452-0018.flac," after that show of spirits, the turnips in that field tasted a rum, long after the ghost shave had sailed away into the blue. the modern spook is possessed not only of humor, but of a caustic satire as well."
850,8238-283452-0036.flac, the french and english selections in this volume are sufficient to prove the contrary.
851,8238-283452-0046.flac, we feel downright neighborly toward such spectres as the futile last ghost nelson lloyd evokes for us as we appreciate the satire of rosoneal's sophisticated race.
852,8238-283452-0003.flac," in that her locks, being long and pinned up, are less easily moved, which may explain the fact, if it be a fact. that infection women have shown themselves more self-possessed."
853,8238-283452-0006.flac," the number of ghost children of any or all types is small proportionately, perhaps because it seems an unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances."
854,8238-283452-0000.flac," introduction. the humorous ghost is distinctly a modern character. in early literature, raiths took themselves very seriously."
855,8238-283452-0020.flac, a ghost moreover that towered and swelled at every hackneyed phrase. till finally he filled the room and burst after the young man proposed to his admired one and made subsequent remarks.
856,8238-283452-0029.flac," has never been a ghost nor used a wooden leg, but its terrifying leg, a sea while you do believe in it. the new ghost has a more nimble and versatile tongue as well as wit."
857,8238-283452-0024.flac," and uses the old thrills only to show what dead batteries they come from. his really electrical effects are his own inventions. he needs no dungeon keeps and monkish cells to play about in, not he."
858,8238-283452-0011.flac, manifestly death has conversations not connected with the consolations of religion. the marvel is that apparitions were so long in realizing their possibilities and improving their advantages.
859,8238-283452-0028.flac," kicking his heels against the railing, and hears his admonition that he'd better hurry up as the live uncle is coming in sight."
860,8238-283452-0045.flac," john kendrick banks has made the darker region seem comfortable and home-like for us, and has created ghosts, created ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward to being one or more."

862,8238-283452-0034.flac," but the spook that provides joke on his host or on himself is a yankee in origin and development. the dry humor, the comic sense of the incongruous, the willingness to laugh at himself as at others,"

868,8238-283452-0041.flac, medieval and later literature give us many instances of love affair or marriage between one spirit and one mortal.
869,8238-283452-0047.flac," the field is still comparatively limited, but a number of americans have done distinctive work in it. the specter now wears motley instead of a shroud."

876,8238-283452-0022.flac, the modern humorous ghost satirizes everything from the old-fashioned specter he's very fond of taking pot shots at him to the latest psychic manifestations.
877,8238-283452-0008.flac," since any living person, however senile, would be thought juvenile compared with a timeless spook. but in these days of individualism and radical liberalism, spooks, as well as mortals, are expanding their personalities,"
878,8238-283452-0016.flac," how little originality and initiative he showed and how dependent he was, pendant he was, pendant he was on his own atmosphere for thrills. his soul appeal was to the spinal column. the ghost of today touches the funny bone as well."
879,8238-283452-0002.flac," his spine gave notice of what etiquette demanded. in the event of outdoor apparition, if a man failed to bear his head in awe, the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness."
880,8238-283452-0012.flac," the specters in classic and medieval literature were, were, were, malarial, vaporous beings without energy to do anything but threatened."

882,8238-274553-0029.flac," except perhaps, perhaps in the single particular, that he was a very great fool. he can try to bear, however, among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking."
883,8238-274553-0074.flac, herman would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duelo.
884,8238-274553-0034.flac," to these, the baron replied at length, is the baron replied at length, still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment, and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer."
885,8238-274553-0023.flac, lay like an incubus upon the university.
886,8238-274553-0045.flac," this being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfill all the spirit, if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult."

888,8238-274553-0057.flac," although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me. having finished the chapter, he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done. i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling."
889,8238-274553-0038.flac," it was radiant with the quizzical expression, which was its natural character, but which i had never seen it as soon, except when we were alone together, and when he unbent himself freely. in an instant afterward, he stood erect."
890,8238-274553-0065.flac," at perse. having finished reading, he begged me with the blandest of all possible, all possible, all possible smiles to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself."
891,8238-274553-0043.flac, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct.
892,8238-274553-0040.flac," for a short time, he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood near him, saying, as he held it firmly clenched."
893,8238-274553-0032.flac," ever upon the lookout for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time passed afforded food for mystification. of this, however, i was not aware."
894,8238-274553-0073.flac," and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit. upon this hint, he proceeded."
895,8238-274553-0044.flac," you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to consider for an instant."
896,8238-274553-0013.flac," i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von young, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character. i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself"

898,8238-274553-0036.flac," i would say, sir, that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman. as herman completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were turned upon the baron."
899,8238-274553-0001.flac," was more or less remarkable for talent of some description. the majority for that species of grotesquery in conception of which teak, a sign of the house, has given a vivid,"

901,8238-274553-0025.flac, and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an order and eloquence.
902,8238-274553-0033.flac," i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. at lengthy spoke, offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r, and giving his reasons in detail."
903,8238-274553-0002.flac," through a place in his regard. and here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental confirmation. in later days, this insight grew more clear."
904,8238-274553-0069.flac, he now explained the mystery.
905,8238-274553-0068.flac," he had handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it. i did so, but to little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning. he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud, to my surprise."
906,8238-274553-0010.flac," after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex combination of human features, can bang so entirely and so, and so, and so, singly the idea of unmitigated gravity."
907,8238-274553-0011.flac," solemnity and repose. it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said, that the baron was one of those human anomalies, now and then to be found, who make the science of mystification."
908,8238-274553-0021.flac," my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society, and not even his own household."
909,8238-274553-0051.flac, the theatre of honor by favon
910,8238-274553-0063.flac," to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation. with sentiments of profound respect, your most obedient servant, van young."
911,8238-274553-0014.flac," ever suspected him to be capable of a joke. ver- oak. verbal or practical. the old bulldog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused. the ghost of heraclitus, or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology."
912,8238-274553-0062.flac, the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient. i am assured.
913,8238-274553-0037.flac," then excessively red. then, dropping his pocket-hankerchief, stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table."
914,8238-274553-0008.flac, he might have been 15 or 50.
915,8238-274553-0020.flac," from his own person to the absurdities, to the absurdities, to which he had given rise. in no instance before that of which i speak, he can't be known the habitual mystific escape."
916,8238-274553-0041.flac, the language you have thought proper to employ
917,8238-274553-0039.flac," for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him, and that he was in sober earnest. he appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face was cadavrously white."
918,8238-274553-0015.flac," this too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, wins of cala, flatis and baphunneries were brought about, if not directly by him."
919,8238-274553-0049.flac," and taking my arm led me to his apartment. i could hardly forebear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profound discravity what he termed, the refindly peculiar character,"
920,8238-274553-0027.flac," a ridicule of those very points for which he contended, did, did, and especially to hold the entire fanfare and aid of dueling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves."
921,8238-274553-0047.flac," striking the reflection of his person, with great precision, and of course, shattering the glass into fragments. the old company at once started to their feet, and with the exception of myself and ritzner, took their departure."
922,8238-274553-0018.flac, which upon each such failure of his praiseworthy endeavors would suffuse every linemen of his countenance. left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions.
923,8238-274553-0030.flac," and i believed for some—and i believed for some logical talent. as a dualist, he had acquired who had fallen at his hands, but they were many. he was a man of courage undoubtedly."
924,8238-274553-0003.flac," which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the 25th of june. i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight, the most remarkable man in the world."
925,8238-274553-0026.flac," an impressiveness and an affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his heirs in general, and absolutely staggered even myself. who well knew him to be at heart?"
926,8238-274553-0064.flac," herman commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-conplacency."
927,8238-274553-0060.flac," upon due reflection, i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest. this being admitted, i still find great difficulty owing to the refined peculiar nature of our disc agreement."
928,8238-274553-0004.flac," no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion. that he was unique. that he was unique. that he was unique, appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted."
929,8238-274553-0058.flac," we'll hand you this note. i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers. in the event of your declining this request,"
930,8238-274553-0046.flac," while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be abvated. with these words, he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite hermen."
931,8238-274553-0054.flac," and having the queen title, duetlelexcripta et non"
932,8238-274553-0017.flac," in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater."
933,8238-274553-0056.flac, per construction m.
934,8238-274553-0031.flac," but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the dwell, dwell, dwell, dwell, and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself. these things were a hobby which he rode to the death. to ritzner."
935,8238-274553-0059.flac," having perused the cartel, he- cartel, he wrote the following reply, which i, harry dehermann. sir, through our common friend at mr. p, i have received your note of this evening."
936,8238-274553-0005.flac," but letting this matter pass for the present, i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university, he began to exercise over the habits"
937,8238-274553-0071.flac," where there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practiced in modern time, practiced in modern time, practiced in modern times. the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in herman's way"
938,8238-274553-0016.flac," lay in that consummate ability, resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self-possession."
939,8238-274553-0067.flac," he seemed to receive hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course. and after a few words of general conversation, went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise, duélie, lechskrypte, et non."
940,8238-274553-0000.flac," i'll have none of them. ned nole, all fools. the baron ritzner van young was a noble hungarian family, every member of which, at least a far back into antiquity as any certain records extend,"
941,8238-274553-0028.flac," looking around me during a pause in the baron's discourse, of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of cold ridge."
942,8238-274553-0050.flac," after a tiresome herring in his ordinary style, he took down from his bookshelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duelo, and entertained me for a long time."
943,8238-274553-0072.flac," two or three weeks before the adventure, tch-tch-tch-tch, and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation."
944,8238-274553-0070.flac," and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow, shadow of meaning it existed. the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately."
945,8238-274553-0053.flac, with a fine margin and bound by jerome.
946,8238-274553-0024.flac," during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the times. the barren, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening,"
947,8238-274553-0007.flac," that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung. then of no particular age, by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded,"
948,8238-274553-0048.flac," as her men went out, the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services. to this i agreed, not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business."
949,8238-274553-0035.flac," your opinions allow me to say baron van young, although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member."
950,8238-274553-0066.flac," to assure him, or him, that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature. somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron."
951,8238-274553-0006.flac," manners, persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him, and influence the most extensive and despotic. yet at the same time, the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable."
952,8238-274553-0019.flac," the adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he can drive to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created."
953,8238-274553-0061.flac," i have great reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette."
954,8238-274553-0052.flac," brand terms memoirs of duels published at cologne, 1666."
955,8238-274553-0009.flac," he was by no means a handsome man, and, and, and, perhaps the reverse. the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh. his forehead was lofty and very fair. his nose a snub."
956,8098-275181-0026.flac," as i ran, two or three dolled wax came to my ear. got him, tom, i shouted, rushing up. tom was holding and squeezing one of his hands with the other, and shaking it violently."
957,8098-275181-0012.flac," had succeeded in getting two more of the turkeys. heroes it is said are born of great crises. this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius. i'll have that fox, he said, when the traps failed."
958,8098-275181-0003.flac," and by day they wondered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beach-nuts, which were very plentiful that fall. all went well, till the last week in october, when on taking the senses one morning a turkey was found to be missing."
959,8098-275181-0031.flac," i just determined to have it out with him. considering the fact that a fox is a very active, sharp-biting animal, and that this was an unusually large male, i have always thought tom got off very well."
960,8098-275181-0013.flac," each awatch, awatch, awatch, a fine dry grass as large as a quart box. these were gathered up and filled the great basket. there, said he triumphantly, don't them smell mousy? they did, certainly."
961,8098-275181-0016.flac," and you was prowling around the fields. go off now, out on the fields. go off now, out there by that stump."" full of wonder and curiosity, i retired to the stump. tom, meanwhile, turned out the mass of nests."
962,8098-275181-0029.flac, his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen. there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow. several minor nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab.
963,8098-275181-0004.flac," the thirty-one had become, had become, had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening. it was the first one we had lost. we proceeded to look for traces. our suspicions were divided."
964,8098-275181-0025.flac," it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there. a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground, at some distance, a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground, at some distance, a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground, at some distance, assisted my wandering wits, and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field."
965,8098-275181-0001.flac," to call the real mice out of their grass-nests, oh mice out of their grass-nests, oh mice out of their grass-nests inside the stone heaps. this indeed is a favorite trick of rendered. at the time of my story, my friend tom edwards, ten years of age,"
966,8098-275181-0023.flac," made by sucking the air sharply, madefully between his teeth. no be off, said tom, and come poking around, nor get inside till you hear me holler."
967,8098-275181-0000.flac," their sharp, cur-like barks used often to rouse us. and of a dark evening we would hear the mountain in the fields, mousing around the stone heaps, making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse."
968,8098-275181-0008.flac," this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only 29 the next morning. there were more fox tracks, and a great many more feathers under the tree. this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter."
969,8098-275181-0009.flac," no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate, together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact. it was clear that something must be done, and at once too."
970,8098-275181-0011.flac," it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch, in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks. i recollect, i recollect, that we set three traps for him to no purpose."
971,8098-275181-0010.flac," or ruin would swallow up the poultry firm. rightly or wrongly, we attributed the mischief to a certain silver gray that had several times been seen in the neighborhood that autumn."
972,8098-275181-0021.flac," with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stoneheaps were, and where we had oftenest heard fox's bark. selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump,"
973,8098-275181-0027.flac," he said not a word, but left me to poke about and stumble on—tumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near. baiky, i exclaimed, after sad, satisfying myself that the fox was dead. some said tom."
974,8098-275181-0032.flac," i do not think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again, however. we sold the fox skin in the village and received $13 for it, whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than $3."
975,8098-275181-0033.flac, how or by what miles that fox got the turkeys out of the high-butternet is a secret.
976,8098-275181-0015.flac," well, look here then. i'll show you,"" said he."
977,8098-275181-0005.flac," tom thought it was the twombly boys, nefarious, as sam in particular. i thought it might have been an owl. but under the tree, in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug, we found fox tracks."
978,8098-275181-0030.flac," these numerous vites, however, were followed by no serious ill-effects. the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass, that he had caught hold of one of its hind legs,"
979,8098-275181-0018.flac," inside the nest. in nest. evidently there were mice in it, and feeling my character as fox at stake, i at once tried it forward, then crept up, and as the rustling and squeaking continued, made a pounce into the grass."
980,8098-275181-0024.flac," and being amidst nice cozy straw, i presently went to sleep quite un-ent- quite un- and quite unintentionally. i must have slept some time, though it seemed to me, but a very few minutes. what woke me was a noise, a sharp, suppressed, yelp!"
981,8098-275181-0002.flac," and myself, and myself, and myself, were in the turkey business, equal partners. we owned a flock of 31, ack of 31 turkeys. these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house, in the very top of it."
982,8098-275181-0007.flac," and a casualty, such as turkey raisers, are unavoidably heirs too. and we bore our laws with resignation. we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roots."
983,8098-275181-0020.flac," then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone. do you see now? he demanded. i saw. but a fox would bite you, i objected. let him bite, sid tom."
984,8098-275181-0019.flac," as i heard it said that foxes did when mousing. instantly, two spry brown hands and the shriek from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip. as a fox i struggled tremendously."
985,8098-275181-0028.flac, and that was all i could get from him that night. we took the fox to the house and laid it a candle. it was the silver or gray. tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed.
986,8098-275181-0017.flac," and with it completely covered himself, and covered himself, and covered himself. the pile now resembled an enormous mouse-nist, or rather a small haycock,"
987,8098-275181-0006.flac," and two or three ominous little wads of feathers, with one, one, one, one long tail feather adrift. thereupon we concluded that the turkey head accidentally fallen down out of the butternut, had a fit perhaps,"
988,8098-275181-0014.flac," they savored as strongly of meiss's tom's question of bad grammar. and don't foxes catch meiss? demanded tom confidently. yes, but i don't see how that's going to catch a fox, i said."
989,8098-275181-0022.flac," tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the content, completely with the content of the big basket. he then practiced squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim. his squeaks were perfect successes."

991,8098-278278-0031.flac," i had eaten the corn, cornmeal, and bag. it was comical how those two men puzzled their brains about that missing commodity. when koon'skin detected some meals stamped in the ground, pod pointed at me and said,"
992,8098-278278-0015.flac," after supper don, after supper don, after supper don feasted on the tougher parts of the steak, and we'd dogs were fed the scraps of potatoes and bread and tin tomato and peach cans. when the banquet was over the guests went home."
993,8098-278278-0030.flac," pod said he would fry the fish, and went at it so enthusiastically that he forgot to put the bag of cornmeal back in its place. after the meal was over he began to look around for the bag. it was nowhere to be found."
994,8098-278278-0037.flac, and laid down on the grass and wondered if that crazy valet had run across any more bear tracks. he wasn't there long when suddenly i heard yells issuing from the canyon downstream round the bend.
995,8098-278278-0004.flac," the happy father called personally on pod and asked him to act as godfather, him to act as godfather at the baptismal service sunday afternoon. the impressive ceremony took place at the cabin of miss pythagorena."
996,8098-278278-0016.flac, about six o'clock we went into camp on the margin of a famous petrified forest. pot objected at first because of the scarcity of firewood.
997,8098-278278-0019.flac," koon's skin's opinion didn't benefit pod much. his heart would fire wasn't very satisfactory, but with some dry brush the man got the meal underway. next morning we visited the noted petrified stump."
998,8098-278278-0035.flac," in the first place it would be worth a hare's breath escape to see one one one one wild. i've only seen bears and circuses, or traveling, chain to italians. in the second place i can run. i have plenty of metals for sprinting."

1007,8098-278278-0014.flac," the ladies looked at the dog, and then at pod, not knowing which to thank. then feeling sensitive about accepting the best part of the steak, insisted upon pods having one of their pieces, and coonskin the other."
1008,8098-278278-0008.flac," it was great excitement and surprise because the flat harns didn't float, and the under-acre or what you call them overturned the barrel of water and said everybody afloat, drenching the sponsors and guests."
1009,8098-278278-0017.flac," lots of petrified wood chips lying around every marked, and they'll last, ordinary wood burns up too fast. bright idea, exclaimed pod, and kuhnskin went to work gathering petrified wood for the supper fire."
1010,8098-278278-0033.flac, that was my experience in the woods of wisconsin. the men at the sawmill said we should see bear in this forest.
1011,8098-278278-0021.flac," it has been estimated by various ornithologists, botanists and entomologists, and nists and entomologists that the stump is millions of years old. i think they were guessing at it, for i couldn't see the rings."

1015,8098-278278-0028.flac," a board sign informed us it was simply turkey creek. i couldn't see any turkeys, but there was good pastureage around. the hot trip through the timber made us all hungry."
1016,8098-278278-0022.flac," several times, several times i had a suspicion that we had been misdirected. when we came to the end of an era wood road, i was sure of it."
1017,8098-278278-0003.flac," a little green-eyed irish girl, five days old, was named pythagorena padina mulgary."
1018,8098-278278-0009.flac," pod said the scene was without a parallel. he was soaked to his equator. the half-christened half-drown pythagorean-a-podina was picked up from the flood with a table spoon, and the ceremony finished."

1022,8098-278278-0013.flac," pod didn't say anything though, but just forked it onto the platter, and scraped off some dry grass and a sliver and a bug, and carved it up."
1023,8098-278278-0039.flac," so he started on a trot downstream to the bend, and then quickly turned, falling all over himself, and ran toward the cabins faster than i ever saw him run before or since."
1024,8098-278278-0007.flac," and kicked so frantically when the priest took her in his arms, that two flat irons were tied to its feet to keep them down. it was simply nervousness because the high altitude affected the child's nerves."

1098,8095-274346-0051.flac," this article, together with the new impositions laid down merchandise by james, constituted near half of the crown revenues. and by depriving the king of these resources, they would have reduced him to total subjection and dependence."
1099,8095-274346-0050.flac, so violet was the bigotry of the times that it was thought a sufficient reason for disqualifying anyone from holding an office.
1100,8095-274346-0015.flac," now, if patriots still remain to keep up the ill humor of the house, and men needed but little instruction or instruction or rhetoric to recommend to their practices,"
1101,8095-274346-0056.flac," without waiting for new incidents, without covering themselves with new pretenses, with the witnesses, they immediately deserted him and refused him all reasonable supply. it was evident that they desired nothing so much as to see him plunged in inextricable difficulties."
1102,8095-274346-0030.flac, and of administering physics to the late king without equating his physicians. all these articles appear from comparing the accusation and reply to be either frivolous or false or both.
1103,8095-274346-0004.flac, the extreme rage against pope-popri was a sure characteristic of puritanism. the house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party.
1104,8095-274346-0053.flac," the smallest appearance of guilt could not be fixed upon him. what idea he asked must all mankind enter the kind, entertain of his honor, should he sacrifice his innocent friend to peculiarity considerations? what further authority should he retain in the nation?"
1105,8095-274346-0021.flac," had expressed all duty and obedience in expectation that an opportunity would offer of reinstating his self in his former credit and authority. even after charles's accession, he dispaired not."
1106,8095-274346-0042.flac," which bringeth such happiness to this nation and makes us envy devol others, while there is this sweetness between his majesty and the commons, lest we lose the repute of a free people by our turbulence in parliament."
1107,8095-274346-0031.flac," the only charge which could be regarded as important was that he had extorted a sum of 10,000 pounds from the east india company, and that he had confiscated some goods belonging to french merchants on pretense of there being the property of spanish."
1108,8095-274346-0043.flac," these imprudent suggestions rather gave warning than struck terror. a precarious liberty, the commons thought, which was to be preserved by unlimited complacence, was no liberty at all, and it was necessary, while yet in their power,"
1109,8095-274346-0027.flac," the king's prohibition was withdrawn and bristol took his seat. provolved at these repeated instances of vigor, which the court denominated, contumacy, charles ordered his attorney general to enter an accusation of high treason against him."
1110,8095-274346-0044.flac," to secure the constitution by such invincible barriers to fears that no king, king, king, or minister should ever for the future dare to speak such a language to any parliament or even entertain such a project against them."
1111,8095-274346-0008.flac," was entrusted with the command. when he sailed immediately for cádiz and found the bay full of spanish ships of great value, he either neglected to attack these ships or attempted it preposterously."
1112,8095-274346-0034.flac," a certain proof that a discovery of this nature was not, as is imagined by several historians,"
1113,8095-274346-0010.flac," with an intention of intercepting the spanish galleons. but the plague having seized the seamen and soldiers, they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this prize and return to england. loud complaints were made against the court for entrusting so important a command"
1114,8095-274346-0049.flac," his mother, who had great influence over him, was a professed catholic. his wife was not free from suspicion."
1115,8095-274346-0022.flac, he submitted to the king's commands of remaining at his country seat and of upsetting himself from parlement. many trials he made to regain the good opinion of his master.
1116,8095-274346-0045.flac," the commons immediately declared that they would proceed no further upon business till they had satisfaction in their privileges. charles alleged, as the reason of this measure, certain seditious expressions, which he said had in their accusation of the duke,"
1117,8095-274346-0039.flac," yet, lest any ambiguity should remain, sir dudley carlton, vice chamberlain, took care to explain it. i pray you, consider,"" said he, what these new councils are, or may be. i fear to declare those that i conceive."""
1118,8095-274346-0001.flac," though a determined protestant, by principle as well as inclination, he had entertained no violent horror against popery, and a little humanity, he thought, was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors."
1119,8095-274346-0012.flac," rendered him more dependent and more exposed to the encroachments of the commons, he was resolved to try once more that regular and constitutional expedient for supply. perhaps to a little political art which at that time he practiced"
1120,8095-274346-0020.flac, but his urgent necessities obliged him to submit.
1121,8095-274346-0032.flac, so that it is difficult for us to give a decisive opinion with regard to these articles.
1122,8095-274346-0040.flac," in all christian kingdoms, you know that parliaments were in use ancient, by which those kingdoms were governed in a most flourishing manner, until the monarchs began to know their own strength, and seeing the turbulent spirit of their parliaments at length."
1123,8095-274346-0041.flac," they, by little and little, began to stand on their prerogatives and at last overthrew the parliaments throughout christendom."
1124,8095-274346-0057.flac," of which they intended to take advantage. to such deep perfitty, to such unbounded user patience, it was necessary to oppose a proper firmness and resolution."
1125,8095-274346-0017.flac, the supply was only voted by the commons. the passing of that vote into a law was reserved till the end of the session. a condition was there by maid in a very undisguised manner with their sovereign.
1126,8095-274346-0014.flac," he thought that he had by that means incapacitated them from being elected members, but his intention being so evident rather put the commons more upon their guard."
1127,8095-274346-0024.flac," and in these he was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection. when the parliament was summoned, charles, by a stretch of prerogative, had given orders that no writ as his customary should be sent to bristol."
1128,8095-274346-0035.flac," the kings seemed desirous of them, this of them, this of them, bracing every opportunity by which he could express it contend and disregard for them. no one was at that time sufficiently sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in the balance of the constitution."
1129,8095-274346-0000.flac," charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances. he was, however, in his heart extremely averse to these furious measures."
1130,8095-274346-0009.flac," the army was landed and a fort taken, but the undisciplined soldiers finding事情, things being stored of wine, could not be restrained from the utmost successes. further stay appearing fruitless, they were reimbarked, and the fleet put to sea"
1131,8095-274346-0046.flac," dropped from these members. upon inquiry, it appeared that no such expressions had been used. the members were released, and the king reaped no other benefit from this attempt than to exasperate the house still."
1132,8095-274346-0023.flac," but finding them all fruitless and observing charles and observing charles and observing charles to be entirely governed by buckingham. his implacable enemy, he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court. a new spirit he saw and a new power arising in the nation."
1133,8095-274346-0036.flac," the history of england had never hitherto afforded one instance where any great movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower house. and as their rank, both considered in a body and as individuals, was but the second in the kingdom,"
1134,8095-274346-0025.flac," that nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition, and craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due as a peer of the realm. his writ was sent him, but accompanied with a letter from the lord keeper coventry"
1135,8095-274346-0033.flac," but so riveted throughout the nation where the prejudices with regard to spanish deceit and falsehood, that very few of the commons seem as yet to have been convinced that they had been seduced by buckingham's narrative."
1136,8095-274346-0002.flac," an abatement of the more rigorous laws was all he intended, and his engagements with france, notwithstanding that their regular execution had never been promised or expected, required of him some indulgence."
1137,8095-274346-0026.flac, commanding him in the king's name to absent himself from parliament. this letter restaled conveyed to the lord and asked advice of how to proceed in some dialogue in a situation.
1138,8095-274346-0038.flac," buckingham, though lying under impeachment, was yet by means of court interest chosen in his place. the commons resented and loudly complained of this affront, and the more to enrage them, the king himself wrote a letter to the university, extolling the duke,"
1139,8095-274346-0052.flac," while they retained such a plunge and, and besides the supply already promised, they were sure that nothing could be refused them. though after canvassing the matter near three months, they found themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke."
1140,8095-274346-0054.flac," where he capable in the beginning of his reign, to give in so signal and instance such matter of triumph to his enemies and discouragement to his adherents. today the commons pretend to rest his minister from him."
1141,8095-274346-0037.flac," nothing less than fatal experience could engage the english princes to pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable assembly. the earl of suffolk, chancellor of the university of cambridge, dying about this time,"
1142,8095-274346-0007.flac," the king, finding that the parliament was resolved to grant, that the parliament was resolved to grant, that the parliament was resolved to grant no supply, and would furnish in with nothing but empty protestations of duty,"
1143,8095-274346-0016.flac," the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the occasion, and ill-fitted to promote those views of success and glory, for which the young prince, in his first enterprise, so are late longed. but this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one."
1144,8095-274346-0048.flac," after many fruitless evasions, the king"
1145,8095-274346-0018.flac," under a color of redressing grievances, which during this short reign could not be very enumerous, they were to proceed in regulating and controlling every part of government which displeased them."
1146,8095-274346-0055.flac," tomorrow, they will attack some branch of his prerogative. by their remonstrances and promises and protestations, they had engaged the crown in a war. as soon as they saw a retreat, retreat impossible."
1147,8095-274346-0013.flac," was trusted to. he had named four popular leaders, sheriff's of counties, sir edward koch, sir robert phillips, sir thomas wentworth, and sir francis seymour. and, though the question had been formally much contested,"
1148,8095-274345-0008.flac," against the emperor, against the emperor ferdinand, hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age, who had seduced and astonished germany by the rapidity of his victories. deep impressions they saw must be made by the english sword,"
1149,8095-274345-0023.flac," all these were discussed in the court, both by the prevalence in the principles of civil liberty essential to their party, and on account of the restraint under which they were held by the established hierarchy."
1150,8095-274345-0012.flac," which the present conjuncture could suggest to them. it is not to be doubted but spleen, which would mean and ill will against the duke of buckingham had which buckingham had an influence with many. so vast and rapid a fortune so little merited."
1151,8095-274345-0027.flac," though it must be remarked that the connections with that, but the connections with that crown were much less obnoxious to the protestants, and less agreeable to the catholics, than the alliance formerly projected to the spain, and were therefore received rather with pleasure than to satisfaction."
1152,8095-274345-0029.flac," sir dudley diggs, sir john elliott, sir thomas wentworth, mr. seldon, and mr. pym. animated with a warm regard to liberty."
1153,8095-274345-0020.flac," the nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of taxes, and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting their sovereign. in elizabeth, notwithstanding her vigor and frugality."
1154,8095-274345-0007.flac," they were equated with the difficulty of military enterprises, directed against the whole house of austria, against the king of spain possessed of the greatest riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in europe."
1155,8095-274345-0032.flac," it was necessary to fix a choice, either to abandon entirely the privileges of the people, or to secure them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitution had either to provide it for them. in this dilemma,"
1156,8095-274345-0025.flac," and on that account was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment. though the religious schemes and schemes of many of the puritans, when explained, a pure pretty flervilous, we are not endless. we are not dense to imagine that they were pursued by none but persons of weak understandings."
1157,8095-274345-0030.flac," of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass. though their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and precedents favorable to king lee power, and had been able, notwithstanding, to preserve some small remains of liberty,"
1158,8095-274345-0017.flac," and held and invested in his single person the most considerable offices of the crown. however, the ill-humour of the commons might have been increased by these considerations, we are not to suppose the sole motives."
1159,8095-274345-0009.flac," and a vigorous offensive war be waged against these mighty potentates, air they would resign a principality which they had now fully subdued at which they held in secure possession by its being surrounded with all their other territories."
1160,8095-274345-0028.flac," as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in prosecution of them. asem. among these we may mention the names of sir edward cope, sir edwin sands, sir robert phillips, sir francis seymour,"
1161,8095-274345-0003.flac," he lightly mentioned the occasion which he had for supply. he employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of the members. he would not even allow the officers of the crown, who had seats in the house,"
1162,8095-274345-0010.flac," to answer, therefore, all these great and important ends, to satisfy their young king in the first request which he made them, to prove their sense of the many royal virtues, particularly economy, with which charles was in due."
1163,8095-274345-0035.flac, are in continual fluctuation. it was as natural in their opinion and allowable for popular assemblies to take advantage of favorable incidents in order to secure the subject.
1164,8095-274345-0024.flac," in order to fortify himself against the resentment of james, buckingham had affected popularity and entered into the cabal of the puritans. but being secure of the confidence of charles, he had since abandoned this party."
1165,8095-274345-0004.flac," and that great anticipation were likewise made on the revenues of the crown. they were not ignorant the charles was loaded with a large debt contracted by his father, who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from foreign princes."
1166,8095-274345-0022.flac," would not augment their number in the same proportion. the puritanical party, though disguised, had a great authority over the kingdom, and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that sect."
1167,8095-274345-0014.flac," his influence over the modesty of charles exceeded even that which he had acquired over the weakness of james, nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel and direction."
1168,8095-274345-0031.flac," it would be impossible, they thought, when all these pretensions were methodized and prosecuted by the increasing knowledge of the age to maintain any shadow of popular government in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign."
1169,8095-274345-0018.flac," the last parliament of james amidst all their joy and festivity, had given him a supply very disproportion to his demand and to the occasion, and as every house of commons which was elected during forty years"
1170,8095-274345-0000.flac," no sooner had charles taken it—no sooner had charles taken it—no sooner had charles taken into his hands the reigns of government. then he showed impatience to assemble the great council of the nation, and he would gladly, for the sake of dispatch, have called together the same parliament which had sit under his father."
1171,8095-274345-0013.flac," could not fail to excite public envy, and however men's hatred might have been suspended for a moment while the dukes conduct seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices, it was impossible for him long to preserve the affections of the people."
1172,8095-274345-0016.flac," fickle in his friendships. all men were f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-nier. all men were either regarded as his enemies or dreaded soon to become such. the whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his insatiable hand, while he, both engrossed the entire confidence of his master,"
1173,8095-274345-0034.flac," the end, they esteemed beneficent and noble, the means regular and constitutional. to grant or refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons, and as all human governments, particularly those of a mixed frame."
1174,8095-274345-0026.flac," the match with france and the articles in favor of catholics which were suspected to be in the treaty, were likewise causes of disgust to this whole party."
1175,8095-274345-0006.flac, they were sensible that the present war was very lately the result of their own important applications and treaties and that they had solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the management of it.
1176,8095-274345-0033.flac, men of such aspiring geniuses and such independent fortunes could not long deliberate. they boldly embraced the side of freedom and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prints without extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty.
1177,8095-274345-0015.flac," his vm-m-m-m-m-temper prompted him to raise suddenly to the highest elevation his flatters and dependence. and upon the least occasion of displeasure, at least occasion of displeasure, he threw them down with equal impeccuosity and violence. implicable in his hatred,"
1178,8095-274345-0002.flac," unexperienced and impolitic, regarded as sincere all the praises and caresses, with which he had been loaded while active in procuring the rupture with the house of austria. and besides that he labored under great necessities,"
1179,8095-274345-0005.flac," they had learned by experience that the public revenue could, with difficulty, maintain the dignity of the crown, even under the ordinary charges of government."
1180,8095-274345-0011.flac," the house of commons, conducted by the wisest and ableist senators that had ever flourished in england, thought proper to confer on the king a supply of two subsidies."
1181,8095-274345-0021.flac," and the necessary war and as in which she was engaged had reason to complain of the commons in this particular. and nor could the authority of that princess, which was otherwise almost absolute, ever extort from them the requisite supplies."
1182,8095-274345-0001.flac," and which lay at that time under pro-orgation. but, being told that this measure would appear unusual, he issued rits for summoning a new parliament on the 7th of may, and it was not without regret that the arrival of the princess henrietta."
1183,8095-274345-0019.flac, succeeded to all the passions and principles of their predecessors. we ought rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the kingdom during that whole period than from any circumstances which attended this particular conjuncture.
1184,78-369-0063.flac," sometimes seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tail. at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the word, so replete with anguish."
1185,78-369-0057.flac," and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death."
1186,78-369-0050.flac," the spare had indeed almost secured her prey, and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery. once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil,"
1187,78-369-0045.flac," a mits cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure, in which i, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant."
1188,78-369-0046.flac," my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling. after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round, an instigated meat to toil and revenge."
1189,78-369-0049.flac," i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey. and the continual protection of hope, returning back upon the heart, often rung bitter drops. i should have despondency and grief for my eyes."
1190,78-369-0051.flac," gain the summit of a sloping ice mountain, gai ice mountain, gai ice mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue died. i've viewed the expanse before me with it, for me with it, for me with the anguish. when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain."
1191,78-369-0047.flac," i departed from land. i cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment."
1192,78-369-0061.flac," oh, when will my guiding spirit and conducting me to the demon allow me the rest i so much desire, or must i, must i so much desire, or must i, must i so much desire, or must i die, and he yet live. if i do,"
1193,78-369-0054.flac," when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags. i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when, after nearly two days' journey,"
1194,78-369-0053.flac," warm tears filled my eyes, which i hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view i had of the demon. but still my sight i was dimmed by the burning drops until"
1195,78-369-0062.flac," swear to me, walton, that he shall not escape, that you will see him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone? no."
1196,78-369-0052.flac," what it could be, and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished the sledge, and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within."
1197,78-369-0059.flac," i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north, and was, vessels ever came so far north, and was astounded at the sight. i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to constructors, and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship."
1198,78-369-0056.flac," as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. the work was, work was, work was soon finished. in a few minutes, it, it, it, it, it, tumult to a sea rolled between me and my enemy."
1199,78-369-0055.flac," my heart bounded within me. but now, when i appeared almost within, when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before."
1200,78-369-0048.flac, which threatened by destruction. but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
1201,78-369-0058.flac," several of my dogs died, and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i sighed sighed sighed sighed or vessel riding at anchor"
1202,78-369-0060.flac, but your direction was northward. you took me on board when my vigor was exhausted. and i should soon have sunk under my multiple hard ships into a death which i still dread. for my task is unfulfilled.
1203,78-369-0005.flac," uncertain what path i should pursue. as night approached, i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william, elizabeth, and my father reposed. i entered it."
1204,78-369-0001.flac," my first resolution was to quit geneva forever. my country, which, when i was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now in my adversity, became hateful."
1205,78-369-0042.flac," concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. a gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before armed with a gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage."
1206,78-369-0017.flac," scared by this horrid apparition, inform me of his path. sometimes, sometimes he himself feared that if i lost all trace of him, i should despair and die. let, let, let some mark to guide me."
1207,78-369-0013.flac," it rang, rang, rang on my ears long and heavily. the mountains re-ecoded, and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter."
1208,78-369-0026.flac, and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. what agonizing fondness did i feel for them?
1209,78-369-0022.flac," i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. my life, as it passed, life, as it passed, life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me. and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy. oh, blessed sleep."
1210,78-369-0033.flac, and no fish could be procured. and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labor.
1211,78-369-0030.flac," where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive. you will find near this place, a-a-a-as if you follow not too tardly, a dead hair."
1212,78-369-0027.flac," and persuade myself that they still lived. at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart, and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the demon, more as a task and joined by heaven."
1213,78-369-0020.flac," that restored and then spirited me. the fair was indeed coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate."
1214,78-369-0010.flac," which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever. and i call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, you, you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work."
1215,78-369-0032.flac," the peasants were shut up in their huffles, and only a few of the most hearty ventured forth to seize the animals, whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey. the rivers were covered with ice."
1216,78-369-0037.flac," oh, how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south, covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness."
1217,78-369-0019.flac," would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. sometimes, when nature overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert."
1218,78-369-0035.flac, will satisfy my everlasting hatred. my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words.
1219,78-369-0043.flac," through fear of his terrific appearance. he carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw, which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs."
1220,78-369-0009.flac," on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear, and by the o night, and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the demon."
1221,78-369-0011.flac," deep of agony. let him feel the despair that now torments me. i had begun my adoration with solemnity, deep solemnity, solemnity, and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends"
1222,78-369-0002.flac," i provided myself with the sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed. and now my wanderings began, which are deceased but with life."
1223,78-369-0012.flac, i heard and approved my devotion. but the furies possessed me as i concluded and raged choke my utterance.
1224,78-369-0029.flac," these words were legible in one of these inscriptions. you live, and my power is complete. follow me. i seek the everlasting ices of the north."
1225,78-369-0000.flac, chapter 24. my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. i was hurried away by fury.
1226,78-369-0040.flac," some weeks before this period, i had procured a sled and dogs, and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed."
1227,78-369-0015.flac," i am satisfied, miserable, wretch, you have determined to live, and i am satisfied. i darted towards a spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp."
1228,78-369-0028.flac," as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious, then as the ardent desire, desire of my soul. what his feelings were, whom i pursued, i cannot know."
1229,78-369-0003.flac," all the hardships which travelers and deserts and barbarous countries are want to meet. how i have lived, i hardly know."
1230,78-369-0036.flac," and calling on heaven to support me, i continued with unabated fervor to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon."
1231,78-369-0044.flac," he had harnessed them, and the same night to the joy of the horror-struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land. and they conjectured"
1232,78-369-0014.flac, and then i was reserved for vengeance. the laughter died away when a well known and a poor voice apparently close to my ear.
1233,78-369-0025.flac," heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice, and beheld voice, and beheld clerville, enjoying health and youth. often, when wearied by a toilsome march, i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come."
1234,78-369-0004.flac," and prayed for death, and for death, but revenge kept me alive, alive, i dare not die and leave my adverse verserion being. when i quitted geneva, my first labor,"
1235,78-369-0021.flac," and vanish. i followed when i could the courses of the rivers, but the demon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected."
1236,78-369-0038.flac," the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. i did not weep, but i knelt down."
1237,78-369-0034.flac," one inscription that he left was in these words, prepare your toil is only begin. wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings."
1238,78-369-0024.flac," during the day i was sustained and inspirated by the hope of night. for in sleep i saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country. again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father."
1239,78-369-0018.flac," the snow's descended on my head, and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plane. to you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown."
1240,78-369-0016.flac," suddenly, the broad disc of the moon arose and shone full upon his gassed, the indistorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed. i pursued him, and for many months this has been my task."
1241,78-369-0023.flac, often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfill my pilgrimage.
1242,78-369-0031.flac," again do i vow vengeance? again do i devote the miserable feign to torture and death? never, never will i give up my search until he or i perish, and then with what ecstasy."
1243,78-369-0007.flac," and effect, effect, effecting even to an uninterested observer. the spirits of the departed seem to flip around."
1244,78-369-0006.flac," and approached the tomb which marked their graves. everything was silent, except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind. the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn."
1245,78-369-0039.flac," and with a full heart, thank my guiding spirits for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's jive to meet and gravel with him."
1246,78-369-0041.flac," and i hope to intercept him before he should reach the beach. with new courage, therefore, i pressed on, peston, peston, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the sea shore. i inquired of the inhabitants"
1247,78-369-0008.flac," their murder also lived, and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence. i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips exclaimed, by the sacred earth."
1248,78-368-0029.flac," and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration. i arrived at geneva, my father and earnest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore."
1249,78-368-0013.flac, and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon and an illuminate chamber. the chamber. the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described.
1250,78-368-0038.flac," my manner, as i thus addressed him, was impressive."
1251,78-368-0042.flac, from the execution of those functions on this occasion.
1252,78-368-0039.flac," and this purpose quieted my agony, agony, agony. and for an interval reconciled me to life. i now relate my history briefly, briefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy."
1253,78-368-0014.flac, i saw the open window of the most hideous and unpaired. a grin was on the face of the monster. he seemed to cheer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.
1254,78-368-0030.flac, misery on his gray hairs doomed him to waste in wretchedness. he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him. the springs of existence suddenly gave way.
1255,78-368-0031.flac," sometimes, indeed, i dreamt that i would."
1256,78-368-0048.flac," i will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment, proportionate to his crimes. but i fear from what you have been told,"
1257,78-368-0027.flac," but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? mine has been a tale of horrors. i have reached their acne, and what i must now relate."
1258,78-368-0045.flac," since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit. i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit."
1259,78-368-0003.flac," that were beginning to rise. suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. i had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects."
1260,78-368-0047.flac," and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his dessert. as i spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes. the magistrate was intimidated. you are mistaken, said he."
1261,78-368-0011.flac," to the room where lay the body of elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her."
1262,78-368-0041.flac," when i had concluded my narration, i said, this is the being whom i accuse, and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power."
1263,78-368-0051.flac," my rage is unspeakable. when i reflect that the murderer, who my have turned loose upon society still exists, you refuse, refuse, refuse my just a man. i have but one resource, and i devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction."
1264,78-368-0044.flac," who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude."
1265,78-368-0023.flac," my father, even now, might be writhing under his grasp, and earnest might be dead at his feet. this idea made me shudder, and recalled me to action."
1266,78-368-0040.flac," and never deviating into invective or exclamation. the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as i continued he became more attentive and interested."
1267,78-368-0002.flac," the clouds swept across its swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves."
1268,78-368-0015.flac," but he eluded me, leapt from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake. the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room."
1269,78-368-0020.flac," and join my sad tears to theirs. all this time, no distinct idea presented itself to my mind."
1270,78-368-0017.flac," after having landed, they proceeded to search the country. parties are going in different directions among the woods and vines. i attempted to accompany them and proceed the short distance from the house."
1271,78-368-0032.flac," melon collie followed, but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries in situation, and was then released for my prison. for they had called me mad, and during many months as i understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation."
1272,78-368-0043.flac," i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance."
1273,78-368-0025.flac," however, it was hardly, however, it was hardly, however, it was hardly morning. and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night."
1274,78-368-0046.flac," and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps, he may be hunted like the shamwa, and destroyed as a beast of prey. but i perceive your thoughts, you do not credit my narrative."
1275,78-368-0018.flac," a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened. my eyes wandered round the room."
1276,78-368-0026.flac," but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness. no creature had ever been so miserable as i was, so frightful and event is single in the history of man."
1277,78-368-0052.flac," i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this. there was a frenzy in my manner, and something i doubt thought of that haughty fierceness, which the martyrs of all they said to have possessed."
1278,78-368-0033.flac," the monster whom i had created, the miserable demon, whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him."
1279,78-368-0019.flac," as if to seek something that i had lost. after an interval i rose, and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay, there were women weeping around. i hung over it."
1280,78-368-0001.flac," the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west, in the west, in the west. the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend."
1281,78-368-0028.flac, know that one by one my friends were snatched away. i was left desolate. my own strength is exhausted.
1282,78-368-0053.flac, how ignorant are thou in thy pride of wisdom? seize.
1283,78-368-0034.flac," and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my id, that i might have him within my grasp. to wreak a great..."
1284,78-368-0036.flac," and told him that i had an accusation to make, that i knew the destroyer of my family, and that i required him to exerct his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer."
1285,78-368-0022.flac," the murder of claire, the murder of claire, the murder of claire val, and lastly of my wife. even at that moment, i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the theme."
1286,78-368-0016.flac," nets were cat-ass-assed but in vain. after passing several hours, we returned hopeless."
1287,78-368-0035.flac," revenge on his cursed head. nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes. i began to reflect on the best means of securing him, and for this purpose"
1288,78-368-0021.flac," subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. the death of william, the execution of justine,"
1289,78-368-0005.flac," when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream. it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired. as i heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind. my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fiber was suspended."
1290,78-368-0008.flac," she was there lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features, half covered by her hair. everywhere i turn, i see the same figure, her bloodless arms and relaxed form."
1291,78-368-0050.flac," but all that i can say, i can say, i can say, will be of little avail. my revenge is of no moment to you. yet while i allow it to be a vice."
1292,78-368-0007.flac, great god! why did i not then expire? why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope?
1293,78-368-0004.flac," and not shrink from the conflict until my own life, or that of my adversary was extinguished. elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence."
1294,78-368-0000.flac," chapter 23 it was eight o'clock when we landed. we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn."
1295,78-368-0024.flac," there were no horses to be procured. and i must, i must return by the lake. but the wind was unfavorable, and the rain fell in torrents."
1296,78-368-0049.flac," have yourself described to be his properties, the piece, the piece that this will prove impracticable. and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment. that cannot be."
1297,78-368-0012.flac, but the deadly langer and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished. their murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck.
1298,78-368-0006.flac, i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. the state lasted but for an instant.
1299,78-368-0009.flac, flung by the murderer on its bridle-brear. could i behold this and live alas! life is obstinant and clings closest where it is most hated.
1300,78-368-0037.flac," however wonderful, forces conviction. the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and i have no motive for falsehood."
1301,78-368-0010.flac," but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. i escaped from them."
1302,7780-274562-0051.flac," it's adaptation to the eyes, which were to be eyes, which were to be eyes, which were to be holded upon earth. in his explanation of this phrasology, mr. ellison did much toward solving, as always seemed to me and enigma. i mean the fact that,"
1303,7780-274562-0094.flac," i repeat that the principle here expressed is in and controversial, but there may be something even beyond it. there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested."
1304,7780-274562-0071.flac," or of the collateral propositions which you might serve to cooperate or sustain. they might or sustain. they might be a class of beings, human wants, but now to humanity invisible."
1305,7780-274562-0072.flac," for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful, more especially than for our own, had been set in order by god the great landscape garden of the whole earth. in the course of our discussion,"
1306,7780-274562-0088.flac," rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance, to the virtues which deny or refrain. beyond these, the critical art can bust a gist."
1307,7780-274562-0050.flac," he perceived that he should be employing the best means, laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfillment of his destiny as poet."
1308,7780-274562-0080.flac, calls up at once to the eye. the fair forms that have passed there in other days. the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest.
1309,7780-274562-0095.flac," yet which, if attained, will lend a charm to the landscape garden and measure a blue star passing that, which a merely human interest could bestow."
1310,7780-274562-0099.flac," now, if we imagine the sense of the all mighty design to be harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness"
1311,7780-274562-0064.flac," let this emanation be submitted to every artist in the world. by each will its necessity be admitted. and even far more than this, this, in remedy of the defective composition,"
1312,7780-274562-0075.flac," detecting and bringing into practice those natural relations of size, proportion, and color which hid from the common observer, observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature. the result of a natural style of gardening"
1313,7780-274562-0086.flac," and appertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate and elevate addison into apotheosis. in truth,"
1314,7780-274562-0069.flac," it is easily understood, mr. ellison, that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might, at the same time, injure a general and more distantly observed effect."
1315,7780-274562-0087.flac, and pale is directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes and flames and invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results.
1316,7780-274562-0060.flac," for the feeling is no affectation or shimmeral. the mathematics, affort, mathematics, affort, mathematics, affort no more absolute demonstrators than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist. he not only believes"
1317,7780-274562-0059.flac," it is but the head long spirit of generalization which has it generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. having, i say, felt it's truth here."
1318,7780-274562-0081.flac," from what i have already observed, you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country."
1319,7780-274562-0067.flac, it was mr. ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty.
1320,7780-274562-0105.flac, that ellison thought to find and found and found and found and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity.
1321,7780-274562-0083.flac," what is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those natural relations of size, proportion and color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much, may mean much, may mean much or little or nothing."
1322,7780-274562-0055.flac," in all other matters, we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme, with her details we shrink from competition. who shall presume to imitate the color of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley?"
1323,7780-274562-0100.flac," definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire, inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendents on the part of intelligence's superior yet akin to humanity."
1324,7780-274562-0061.flac," but positively knows that such and such apparently, such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, were formed, or form, constitute, and alone constitute, the true beauty."
1325,7780-274562-0076.flac, and the prevalence of a beautiful harmony in order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.
1326,7780-274562-0082.flac," the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. of course, much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities."
1327,7780-274562-0089.flac," we may be instructed to build an odyssey, but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a tempest, an inferno, a prometheus bound, a nightingale,"
1328,7780-274562-0091.flac," the softest of the negative school, who negative school, who through inability to create, have scoffed that creation, are now found the loudest in a plow."
1329,7780-274562-0065.flac, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation. i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that
1330,7780-274562-0090.flac," such as that of keats or the sensitive plant of shelley, shelley, shelley. but the thing done,"
1331,7780-274562-0056.flac, the criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error. no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points
1332,7780-274562-0073.flac," to have well treated this theme. there are properly, he writes, but two styles of landscape gardening, the gardening, the natural and the artificial."
1333,7780-274562-0046.flac," no definition had spoken of the landscape gardener as of the poet. yet my friend cannot fail to perceive that the creation of the landscape garden offered to the true muse, the most magnificent of opportunities."
1334,7780-274562-0049.flac," and then the multicolor of the flower, he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness. and in the direction or concentration engine of this effort or"
1335,7780-274562-0078.flac," which bear some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture. whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening,"
1336,7780-274562-0101.flac," than the sentiment of interest is preserved. well, the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature, a nature which is not god, nor an emanation of god."
1337,7780-274562-0103.flac," and the free exercise in the open air, open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans and the continuous and unseizing object which these plans afford."
1338,7780-274562-0057.flac," of human-loveliness, do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as gladdens our daily path. byron, who often aired, aired not in saying, i've seen more living beauty."
1339,7780-274562-0070.flac," he spoke upon this topic with warmth. regarding not so much, it's immediate or obvious important, which is little."
1340,7780-274562-0066.flac, therefore her susceptibility of improvement.
1341,7780-274562-0062.flac," yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression. it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them."
1342,7780-274562-0047.flac," here was, indeed, the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination, invention or imagination, invention or imagination, in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty."
1343,7780-274562-0052.flac," which none but the ignorant dispute. that dispute, that dispute, that no such combinations of scenery exist, of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce."
1344,7780-274562-0093.flac," are less objectionable. a mixture of pure art and a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. this is just, and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so."

1466,7517-100437-0015.flac," are the golden age and dream days? am i not right? thank you. but the book, you have not read my book."
1467,7517-100437-0007.flac, in borrowing the classic upon which you were brought up. this is... this is too much for me. let us say no more about it.
1468,7517-100437-0010.flac," of a book, book, book which should be a classic, but is not, of a book of which nobody has heard, unless through me. it was published some 12 years ago, the last published book,"
1469,7517-100437-0033.flac," but i must give you one word of warning. when you sit down to it, doubt be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgment on my taste."
1470,7517-100437-0019.flac," my answer to the question whether i had anything to say would be, well, my lord, my lord, if i might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving. mr. justice starling"

1475,7517-100429-0028.flac," what will happen then? aldenham may know, but we his guests do not. some things i think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and the kitchen garden, but for myself,"
1476,7517-100429-0005.flac," thus, the steps help... the steps help to make the pond a convenient rain gauge. for obvious lich. for obvious lich. for obviously, when only three steps are left uncovered, as was the case last monday."
1477,7517-100429-0009.flac, has done that damage. the soul yearns for something more startling than that. the record of the pond.
1478,7517-100429-0003.flac," it is known simply as the pond, a designation which ignores the existence of several neighboring ponds, the gifts of nature, and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man."
1479,7517-100429-0027.flac, to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond. for there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full.

1481,7517-100429-0031.flac," so that we may watch it fill again. i must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond, but all the same."
1482,7517-100429-0025.flac," yet if our hostess were to see us marching out within umbrella, how odd she would think us. where are you off to, she would ask, and we could only answer lamely."
1483,7517-100429-0016.flac, we have a little argument about it. miss robinson being convinced that she stood on the second step after breakfast. and miss smith repeating that it looks
1484,7517-100429-0018.flac," must be a record. but anyhow, it is fairly fine now. and what about a little long tennis, or golf, or croquet, or... and so the arrangements for the morning are made."
1485,7517-100429-0029.flac, i believe that we are promised something much bigger than that. a man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives.
1486,7517-100429-0004.flac," for the pond is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious. there are seven steps to the bottom of the pond, and each step"

1497,7517-100429-0008.flac," for when your whole day's cricket has been spoiled, it is perfectly absurd."
1498,7517-100429-0010.flac," sooth's us, where the record of the ordinary, pedantic rain gauge would leave us infuriated, us infuriated, us infuriated. it speaks much for my friend alden ham's breadth of view that he understood this."
1499,7517-100429-0007.flac," drained secretly into the pond and secretly into the pond, too. this seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers."
1500,7517-100429-0006.flac," when the pond began to fill. to strangers, this may seem surprising, and it is only fair to tell them the great secret, which is that much of the surrounding land."
1501,7517-100429-0013.flac," i am one of those who cannot write letters in another man's house. and when my pipe is well-aligned, i say to miss robinson, or whoever it may be, let's go and look at the pond."
1502,7517-100429-0023.flac, all this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals. but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents.

1505,7113-86041-0097.flac," this time, to his great annoyance, the great annoyance, the number was different, so he reckoned them for the third time. now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones, and this was hardly to be wondered at, as his mind was full of the princesses"
1506,7113-86041-0085.flac, unless he could be forever chattering.
1507,7113-86041-0079.flac," caught him in her cruel beak. and before he could say a word, he had disappeared down her throat. these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more."
1508,7113-86041-0104.flac, echo answered in the marble halls there was neither voice nor footsteps then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace
1509,7113-86041-0100.flac," into the arms of her beloved prince, radabor. meanwhile, the toiling gnome went through his task over and inter and over again, in ten, ten, to his back ache and his head swam, and he could no longer put two and two together."

1511,7113-86041-0103.flac, but without success.
1512,7113-86041-0099.flac," which she changed into a spirited horse, all saddled and writhed, writhed, writhled. and springing upon its back, she galloped away over hill, and dale, till she reached the thorny valley, flung herself,"
1513,7113-86041-0090.flac," and her flowing and her flowing veils sparkled with gems. in these magnificent garments, she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace. loveliest of maidens, he stammered, bowing low before her. let me gaze into your dear eyes."
1514,7113-86041-0094.flac," ask some proof, sweetheart,"" said he, pup my obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love. be it so, answered the crafty maiden, then give me"
1515,7113-86041-0096.flac," he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper. he nimble as a grasshopper. he nimble as a grasshopper. and had soon counted them all. but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake, he thought he would just run over them again."
1516,7113-86041-0078.flac," but i am held captive by the gnome, in his palace under the mountains. so the cricket hopped off gaeli, determined to do his best to deliver his message. but alas, a long-legged stork who was prancing along the same road,"
1517,7113-86041-0081.flac," and bid him come with horses and men, the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley. the magpie listened, hopped a while from branch to branch, and then darted away."
1518,7113-86041-0083.flac," which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him, and his memory forever. therapan, he caught up a great stone."
1519,7113-86041-0084.flac, but the magpie in the tree who like
1520,7113-86041-0095.flac," that shall be the test of your truth towards me."" unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment, he obeyed her commands without delay, and hurried off to begin his task."
1521,7113-86041-0088.flac," she left off, duff, duff, duff, duff, treating the gnome with coldness and indifference. indeed, there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might someday return his love of love. and the idea pleased him mightily. the next day."
1522,7113-86041-0077.flac," then and there. after that, after that, by the power of the wonderful wand, she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting. hop little cricket, to radabor, and chirp in his ear that i love him only."
1523,7113-86041-0106.flac," and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years, and his fury was vain. the thunder clouds melted away into a soft mist,"
1524,7113-86041-0107.flac," and the gnome, and the after flying about for a while in despair, be wailing to the four winds, his unhappy fate, went sorrowfully back to the palace, and stole once more, through every room, with many size and limitations."
1525,7113-86041-0087.flac," while the prince hurried back to his castle together together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall. the princess, meanwhile, was craftily pursuing her plan of escape."
1526,7113-86041-0082.flac," now prince radabor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods, and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief. one day, as he sat in the shade of an oak tree, dreaming of his lost princess, and sometimes crying her name aloud."
1527,7113-86041-0080.flac," this time she changed the turnip into a magpie. flutter from tree to tree, chattering bird said she. till you come to radabor my love."
1528,7113-86041-0086.flac," all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment, and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess. but the magpie knew no more than the lesson, no more than the lesson, no more than the lesson he had learned. so he soon fluttered away."
1529,7113-86041-0110.flac, to the depths of his underground kingdom.
1530,7113-86041-0108.flac," he passed through the gardens, which for him had lost their charm, and the sight of the princesses' footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief. always lonely, empty, sorrowful."
1531,7113-86041-0098.flac," pretty looks and words. as for the maiden, no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight. then she began to prepare for flight. she had a fine, fresh turnip hidden close at hand."
1532,7113-86041-0089.flac," as soon as the sun rose, she made her appearance, decked as a bride, in the wonderful robes and jewels, which the fond gnome had prepared for her, her, her, her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle, blossoms."
1533,7113-86041-0109.flac," and the foresake in gnome resolved, but he would have gnome more tealings with such false creatures."
1534,7113-86041-0101.flac," but as he felt taller, really certain of the exact number of turnips in the field, big and little together, he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be. he felt very well satisfied with himself,"
1535,7113-86041-0093.flac," and yet i am fearful. a wife cannot always charm, and though you will never alter. the beauty of mortals is as flower that fades. how can i be sure that you will always be as loving, and charming as you are now?"
1536,7113-86041-0102.flac," as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her. but, alas, she was no longer there. he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree engaged into every pond."
1537,7113-86041-0091.flac," ""'your constancy has overcome me,' she said. ""'i can no longer oppose your wishes, but believe my words and suffer this fail still to hide my blushes and tears. why tears?' beloved one, cried the gnome anxiously."
1538,7113-86041-0092.flac," every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold. greatly as i desire your love, i do not ask a sacrifice. ah, cried the false princess. why do you misunderstand my tears?"
1539,7113-86041-0002.flac," for a basil loved all pretty things. sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions. and come out upon the green earth for a while, and bask in the sunshine and hear the bird sing."

1541,7113-86041-0023.flac," as the wandering breeze scattered it. daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink, while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round, making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable."
1542,7113-86041-0071.flac," looking forward to the coming of their wedding day. the brides mysterious disappearance, look disappearance, look disappearance took place. the sad news drove radabor distracted, and as the days went on and nothing could we heard of the princess, he forsoaked his castle,"
1543,7113-86041-0035.flac," they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her fathers seemed about a poor cottage in comparison with it. and when she recovered from her astonishment, she found herself seated upon a couch."
1544,7113-86041-0057.flac," lay the once frolic some-banny, with all four feet stretched stiffly out, while the little feet stretched stiffly out, while the little feet stretched stiffly out, while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion. the horrified princess fled to the door."
1545,7113-86041-0024.flac," were spread out strange fruits and sweet meats, the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them. she hesitated a while, however, scarcely able to believe her eyes."
1546,7113-86041-0050.flac," the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman, and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before."
1547,7113-86041-0014.flac," beyond them, float a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock, filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide."
1548,7113-86041-0059.flac," sweetest and fairest of damsels, cry the gnome, do not be angry. everything that is in my power i will do. but do not ask the impossible. so long as the sap was fresh in the roots,"
1549,7113-86041-0005.flac," and in their place appeared blossoming orchards, surrounded cozy looking, thatched cottages. for every chivney, the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air. sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows."
1550,7113-86041-0067.flac," and then without fail, you shall have your puppets to play with. almost before the gnome had finished, the disappointed princess turned away, and marched off to her own apartments without daining to answer him. the gnome, however."
1551,7113-86041-0017.flac," when he understood this, he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket, and took the form of a handsome young man. that was the best way. and he fell in love with a girl, then and there."
1552,7113-86041-0043.flac," carrots, turnips, and radishes, and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess, who set, who set, who set, pensive in the shade of, of, of, of, the rose-bower. loveliest daughter of earth, said the gnome, banish all sorrow."
1553,7113-86041-0016.flac, he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels. and a nest to field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens.
1554,7113-86041-0041.flac," and in a thousand waves, strove to dispel the cloud, but in vain. at last, he said to himself, men are sociable creatures, like bees or ants."
1555,7113-86041-0036.flac," wrapped in a wonderful robe satin, fastened with a silken girdle, while beside her knelt a young man who whispered sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear. the gnome, for he was, told her all about himself."
1556,7113-86041-0015.flac," the sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that, for the first time, he wished himself immortal, and longing for a better view of the gay company. he changed himself into a raven."
1557,7113-86041-0027.flac," which certainly did look very, very, very inviting. and they all went galley to this new amusement. the princess was ready first, but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down, down, down she sank."
1558,7113-86041-0075.flac," just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared. but she really had another purpose in view. one day, she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover. fly."
1559,7113-86041-0011.flac," so he ran away and went to serve the judge. here, served the judge. here, served the judge. here, he upheld the law with might and mane, and was a terror to thieves and evil doers. but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law."

1561,7113-86041-0063.flac," to take possession of the freshly filled basket. but to her surprise, she could not find it anywhere. up and down the garden she searched, spying into every corner, but not a sign of it was to be found."
1562,7113-86041-0032.flac," the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished, and so had the marble bath. the bow of jasmine, instead, all was a tangle of flowers, as it had been of old."
1563,7113-86041-0020.flac, stepping out of his hiding place.
1564,7113-86041-0062.flac," and the princess, with her magic wand, touched the wrinkled old women, and the wrinkled old women, and left them the withered roots they really were, to be thrown upon the rubbish heap. and with light feet, skipped off across to the meadow,"
1565,7113-86041-0001.flac," and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks. and some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapors, to change dull stones to precious metal, or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies."
1566,7113-86041-0056.flac," and started back at the sight of a group of shriveled crones, with bent backs and trembling limbs, whose supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismaly. a little nearer to the hearth."
1567,7113-86041-0034.flac," sprite or goblin, and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt. for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long. meanwhile, the princess was not at all unhappy."
1568,7113-86041-0054.flac," while brunelda and the rest faded visibly. they assured her that all was well with them, but nevertheless, they continued to waste away."
1569,7113-86041-0040.flac," but the princess felt no such happiness. in spite of all the magic delights around her, she was sad. though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome. however, he soon perceived her melancholy."
1570,7113-86041-0048.flac," the gnome had given to his hoped for bride. there they found so much to amuse them, that the hours passed like minutes. fails, girdles, and necklaces were tried on and admired."
1571,7113-86041-0058.flac," the greatest delight of my lonely hours. isn't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your, their, their turning the castle into a hospital for the aged? give my maidens back, their, their, their youth and health this very minute, or i will never love you."
1572,7113-86041-0064.flac," by the truss of grapevine, she met the gnome, who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off."
1573,7113-86041-0038.flac," on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay, sweet flowers, and velvet lawns all cool and shady, which pleased the eye of the princess. the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples."
1574,7113-86041-0007.flac," nor did he wish to interfere with their fear with their fear with their doings, but left them in quiet possession of their homes. as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves."
1575,7113-86041-0065.flac," dear queen of f***ing of my heart answered he, i pray you to forgive my carelessness. i promised more than i could perform. i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire, but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty-sellers."
1576,7113-86041-0066.flac," and the fields are bare and their bare and duttle it. for below in the valley winter rains only here in your present spring is held fast. and wherever your foot is set, the gay flowers bloom, have patience for a little."
1577,7113-86041-0053.flac," they played from morning to night, only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and won. and the mayor and the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom."
1578,7113-86041-0045.flac," take this little mini, colored wand, and with a touch, give to each root the form you desire to see. with this, he left her, and the princess without an instant delay. open the basket."
1579,7113-86041-0008.flac," he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man. so taking the form of an old field laborer, he entered the service of a farmer. under his care, all the crops flourished exceedingly."
1580,7113-86041-0026.flac," running hither and dither and high glee, and calling maryly to each other. at last, when they were quite wary, the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would contend her but to bathe in the marble pool."
1581,7113-86041-0068.flac," and disguising himself as a farmer, bought an ass in the nearest market town, and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip, carrot and radish seed. with this he sowed a great field."
1582,7113-86041-0042.flac, who is there i can find for her to talk to?
1583,7113-86041-0037.flac," and his great underground kingdom, and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace, and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them, till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendor."
1584,7113-86041-0025.flac," but at length curiosity prevailed, and she and her companions explored to their hearts content."
1585,7113-86041-0031.flac," the scene of this strange adventure, thinking, venture, thinking as people will and sorrow, that there might be some mistake after all. but when he reached the spot, behold, all was changed again."
1586,7113-86041-0072.flac," and the society of men and spent his days in the wild force roaming about and crying her name allowed to the trees and rocks. meanwhile, the maiden in her gorgeous prison sighed in secret over her grief, not wishing to arouse the known suspicions."
1587,7113-86041-0074.flac," for the roots which they had capped warm through all the cruel winter had now come to their full size. day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them, conjuring up now this longed-for person, and now that."
1588,7113-86041-0022.flac," the red rocks had become white marble, it come white marble, it come white marble and alabaster. the stream that murmur, that murmur and struggled before in its rocky bed, its rocky bed, floating silence, now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt."
1589,7113-86041-0018.flac," the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country, and she often wandered in the forest with her playfellows gathering the wildflowers and fruits. till the midday he drove the mary band to the shady lawn."
1590,7113-86041-0076.flac," so the bee spread, his shining, shining, shining wings, and flew away to do as he was bitten. but before he was out of sight, a greedy swallow made a snatch, snatch, snatch at him. and to the great grief of the princess, her messenger was eaten up."
1591,7113-86041-0013.flac," where studded charming maiden, fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon. around her upon the grass lay her young companions, as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game."
1592,7113-86041-0052.flac," whose name was benny. and now all went cheerfully in the castle. the princess gave to each of the muck, of the muck, of the maidens, her task, and never was mistress better served. for a whole week, she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed."
1593,7113-86041-0006.flac," came the music of the shepherd's pipe. the strangeness and the pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests, who without saying, by your leave or with your leave,"
1594,7113-86041-0021.flac," weaving his magic spells till slowly all that about him changed. and when the maidens returned at noon to their favorite resting place, they stood lost in amazement and almost fancy that they must be dreaming."
1595,7113-86041-0012.flac," down to his underground palace, very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind. but as time went on, he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him, and thought he would take another look at the upper world."
1596,7113-86041-0069.flac," and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch intended, and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seas. thus fostered, they grew and flourished marvelously."
1597,7113-86041-0029.flac," but which had swallowed up the princess before their eyes, they even sprang into the water, and tried to dive after her, but in vain. they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool, and could not keep under water for a second."
1598,7113-86041-0033.flac," the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princesses' playfellows, with all sorts of punishments, if they would not confess something about her disappearance. but as they only repeated the same story, he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some..."
1599,7113-86041-0004.flac," to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills. but the next time he ventured above ground, what was his surprise to find everything changed. the dark woods were huge down."
1600,7113-86041-0061.flac, and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see. the great green patch in the garden will prove you with a more lively company. so saying the gnome took himself off.
1601,7113-86041-0000.flac," rebuzzle. over all the fast underworld, fast underworld, fast underworld, the mountain-nome rebuzzle was lured, and busy enough the care of his- care of his dominions kept him. there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through."
1602,7113-86041-0055.flac, to take part in the game to get games of the princess to that last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows. she shuddered.
1603,7113-86041-0030.flac," they sought last that there was nothing for it, but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughters' disappearance. and what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told."
1604,7113-86041-0060.flac," the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired. but as the sapt dried up, they withered away. but never trouble yourself about that dearest one. a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right."
1605,7067-76048-0050.flac, he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered and improper familiarity with socialist ideas.
1606,7067-76048-0034.flac, so richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martinot. he recalled to the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin.
1607,7067-76048-0022.flac," devoted to his work, and he's writing a book which has saturated him, saturated him, saturated him in these ideas. only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it. the psychology of a new age. the world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its history."
1608,7067-76048-0030.flac," you will find my father extremely difficult, but some of our younger men would love it. and, she went on, there are american women who'd love it too. we're petted, petted, petted. we're kept out of things. we aren't placed."
1609,7067-76048-0020.flac," i've been talking of this sort of thing with my friend, dr. martino, and i've been thinking as well as talking, that perhaps is why i'm so clear and positive. i don't complain that you are clear and positive. i've been coming along the same way."
1610,7067-76048-0019.flac," a disciplined mankind going on to greater things. don't you? now, things don't you? now you tell me of it. she said with a smile, i do. but before? no. you've made it clear. it wasn't clear before."
1611,7067-76048-0003.flac," and she repeated no remembered comments and profits of her contemporary and her contemporaries about herself. she either concealed, health. she either concealed, health. she either concealed, or she had lost any great interest in her own personality."
1612,7067-76048-0057.flac," and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise. tomorrow the new age will be here no doubt, be here no doubt, be here no doubt, but today it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings. so that it was natural for miss gromont and sir richmond to ask,"
1613,7067-76048-0038.flac," her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond. i realize i've got to be a responsible american citizen, she had said."
1614,7067-76048-0031.flac," we don't get enough to do. we're spenders and wasteers, not always from choice. while these fathers and brothers and we're husband of ours play about with the fuel and power and life, and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker."
1615,7067-76048-0052.flac," mr. lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behavior under bad treatment. there was some mystery story, however, connected with her war services in europe, upon which miss gromont was evidently indisposed to dwell."
1616,7067-76048-0001.flac," ""'now, sir, please,' said the guard respectfully, but firmly. ""'now, now,' and dr. martin, no god in. sir richmond walked, thought, thought, thought, thoughtfully down the platform towards the platform, towards the exit. what else could i do?' he asked aloud to nobody in particular."
1617,7067-76048-0005.flac," she liked his turn of thought. she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke. and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers, like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favored visitor."
1618,7067-76048-0009.flac," sir richmond and miss gromont had walked round the old circumvulation together, but belinda seaford had straight away from them, professing an interest in flowers."
1619,7067-76048-0016.flac," who have imaginations once, who have imaginations once something more nowadays. of course we want bright lives, of course we want happiness, just as we want happiness, just as we want happiness, just as we want food, just as we want sleep. but when we have eaten, who when we have eaten, when we have slept, when we have jolly things about us, it is nothing."
1620,7067-76048-0053.flac," still quite vaguely guessing. so much fact about miss gromant, as we have given, had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half. the fragments came up as illusions, or by way of illustration."
1621,7067-76048-0042.flac," she would someday, she laughed, be swimming in oil and such, like property. her interest in sir richmond's schemes for us—ritchman's schemes for us—ritchman's schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was, therefore, she realized, a very direct one—direct one, direct one. but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that."
1622,7067-76048-0002.flac," section 2. section 2. for the better part of 40 hours, sir richmond had either been talking to miss gromont, carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence,"
1623,7067-76048-0011.flac," nobody is doing anything with the world except model about why not give it a direction. you take it in your hands like clay? obduet clay with a sort of recalcitrant, unintelligent life of its own."
1624,7067-76048-0013.flac," i am tired of seeing all the world doing the same. i am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great disasters. here is something mankind can attempt, that we can attempt. and will? i believe that as mankind grows up"
1625,7067-76048-0027.flac," but controlling father as distinguished from managing him, she reviewed some private and private and amusing memories. he is a most intractable man."
1626,7067-76048-0058.flac," what do we do with such types as father, and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise? they had a joint enterprise. they had a joint enterprise. they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired, as a world scientifically ordered,"
1627,7067-76048-0007.flac," its delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch. both miss greer or monten missifert displayed an intelligent interest in their food. after lunch, they had all gone out to the stones and the wall."
1628,7067-76048-0056.flac, but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with dr. martino. the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings.
1629,7067-76048-0029.flac," gunter lake, the big banker, she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him. all these people, she said, are pushing things about affecting millions of lives."
1630,7067-76048-0044.flac," at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that, when mr. mr. grimont's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost."
1631,7067-76048-0045.flac," and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter, and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her, provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway. after all."
1632,7067-76048-0047.flac, after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and into a shirt waist and an office downtown. she had been an- i f- hound. she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mr. gromont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard.
1633,7067-76048-0041.flac," or they fell appraise to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries. but anyhow, they were steered. she herself, it was clear, was bound to become a very, very responsible citizen indeed."
1634,7067-76048-0021.flac," it's—it's—it's—it's refreshing to meet you. i found it refreshing to meet mottno, a twinge of conscience about dr. mottno, turned to sir richmond into a new channel. he's a most interesting man, he said. rather shy in some respects."
1635,7067-76048-0048.flac," she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours, and at the end of the day, she mentioned casually a large automobile with two men's servants"
1636,7067-76048-0006.flac," as a crisis in which they were called upon to do something. they did not yet clearly know what. into this topic they appeared as into some deep pool, side by side, and in it they saw each other reflected."
1637,7067-76048-0010.flac," that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it, set it marching towards that new world of yours of 250 million fully developed beautiful and happy people. why not?"
1638,7067-76048-0017.flac," we have been made an exception of, and got our rations. the big thing confronts us still."
1639,7067-76048-0039.flac," that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote. she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes, and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well."
1640,7067-76048-0024.flac, there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities. we are sharing the adolescence of our race. it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us.
1641,7067-76048-0054.flac," the sustaining topic was this new age, sir richmond foreshadowed. this world undersigned if it controlled, the utopia of fully developed people, fully developing the resources of the earth."
1642,7067-76048-0046.flac, he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicality of his life's ideal. there was hettie green green green green. this latter idea had left her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe.
1643,7067-76048-0037.flac," but passion was a thing men and women fell, men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common. when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a f***** fresh thread of common interest, then it wasn't so necessary. it might happen!"
1644,7067-76048-0049.flac," this masculinization idea had also center on a commission of inquiry into mexico. there, apparently, she had really done responsible work. but upon the question of labor, mr. gromont was fierce."
1645,7067-76048-0014.flac," when pride ourselves upon our freedom from the sin of presumption, not quite that, well, how do you put it?"" ""'we are afraid,' she said. ""'it's too vast. too vast. we want bright little lives of our own.'"""
1646,7067-76048-0059.flac," an immense organization of mature common sense, healthy and pure common sense, healthy and secure, gathering knowledge and power for creative adventurers as yet beyond dreaming."
1647,7067-76048-0028.flac, they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business. she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own.
1648,7067-76048-0008.flac, to a happy use by clamoring to the top of it and sliding on their little beehines down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing.
1649,7067-76048-0004.flac," but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life, and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences, and her liking for serenity was pleasingly manifest."
1650,7067-76048-0012.flac, her imagination glowed in—her imagination glowed in—her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice. i believe what you say is possible—if—if people dare. i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them.
1651,7067-76048-0033.flac," she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy, that some controversy, that some controversy that had played a large part in her life. that isn't going on, and on, and on."" she said with an effect of conclusive decision."
1652,7067-76048-0032.flac," with all the empty and speakable solemnity of the male, and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings. ""'that can't go on,' she said. her eyes went back to the long, low, undulating skyline of the downs."
1653,7067-76048-0025.flac, making them matter it. to-to-to-us formally they didn't seem to matter. that idea of the bright little private life has to go by-has to go by the board. i suppose it has. she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before.
1654,7067-76048-0023.flac," the adolescence, so to speak, of mankind. it is an idea that seizes the imagination. there is the imagination. there is a flow of new ideas abroad. he thinks widening the ideas, widening the ideas, widening realizations, unprecedented hopes and fears."
1655,7067-76048-0040.flac," she had no illusions about the power of the former class. it didn't exist. they were steered to their decisions by people employed, directed, or stimulated by father, and his friends and associates, the owners of america, the real, responsible citizens."
1656,7067-76048-0000.flac," i leave you, i leave you, i leave you to it."" his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation. i was overnight irritation. i ought you to leave me to it. smile, sir richmond. i shall be interested to learn what happens. but if you won't stay to see."
1657,7067-76048-0035.flac," he felt that he felt that this time at any rate, he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being, charming human being, charming human being. this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments."
1658,7067-76048-0060.flac, and replaceable structures indeed. both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before.
1659,7067-76048-0051.flac," and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake. gunter lake, sir richmond gathered, wasn't half a bad fellow. generally, it would seem miss gromont liked him, and she had a way of speaking about him, and they have speaking about him that suggested that in some way"
1660,7067-76048-0043.flac," father, it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her. he despised and distrusted women generally, and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son."
1661,7067-76048-0018.flac," i do not know why it should be so, but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind. i want it as my culminating want. i want a world in order."
1662,7067-76048-0036.flac," in the composition of so sure and gallant to personality. martin noe was very fine-minded in many respects, but he was an old maid. and like all old maids, he saw man and woman in every encounter."
1663,7067-76048-0026.flac," incidentally, he smiled, i want to get a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbarer person, your father. i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world, world, world control of fuel production and distribution."
1664,7067-76048-0015.flac," sensible little piggy-wiggies. we have a right to life and happiness."" first, said sir richmond, as much right as a pig has to food, but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings"
1665,7067-76048-0055.flac," for a number of trivial reasons, sir richmond found himself as scribing the project of this new age almost wholly to dr. martino, and presenting it as a much-complete scheme than he was justified in doing. it was true that dr. martino had not said many of the things sir richmond described to him."
1666,7067-76047-0019.flac," may involve very mysterious consequences indeed, with which i, for one, do not wish to be involved. sir richmond, upon the hearth rug, had a curious feeling that he was back, back, back in the headmaster's study at caxton."
1667,7067-76047-0029.flac, she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration. that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely. miss cromont is not silly.
1668,7067-76047-0006.flac," on the second occasion, sir richmond smiled, smiled, smiled again. frankly, said the doctor, this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me. it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling."
1669,7067-76047-0042.flac," you, i say, are also at loose ends. can you deny it? my dear sir, don't we both know that ever since we have left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three her port of kindness?"
1670,7067-76047-0036.flac," or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery, where she treachery, where she didn't expect it. she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth. she has ceased to take the world for granted. it hasn't broken her, but it has matured her."
1671,7067-76047-0041.flac," you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls. she is very much at loose ends. you, on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady, miss martin leads."
1672,7067-76047-0010.flac, i'm twice her age. we are a party of four. there are conventions. there are considerations. there are considerations. there are considerations. aren't you really my dear martinot over doing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests?
1673,7067-76047-0007.flac," don't you think, said sir richmond, that you are attaching rather too much, what shall i say, romantic, flirtatious, meaning to this affair?"
1674,7067-76047-0004.flac," for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree, and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum. i object to miss gromont on, on, on, and that side of the thing, more than i do to miss efer."
1675,7067-76047-0033.flac," she would find, i'm that life was worthwhile to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life, her monstrous, her monstrous silly waste of time. with the facility of her sex, she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worthwhile for him."
1676,7067-76047-0031.flac," and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position. before she was twenty, i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presence. those who seek find."
1677,7067-76047-0024.flac," her manner with miss seaford, an excellent manner for miss seaford by the by, isn't the sort of manner any, of manner any, of manner anyone acquires in a day, or for one person only. she is a very sure and commanding young woman. sir richmond nodded."
1678,7067-76047-0020.flac," and in many ways interesting. i have been watching her. i have not been favored with very much of her attention, but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile."
1679,7067-76047-0018.flac," this young lady, whose charm and cleveness i admit, behaves, behaves as if thrift the new age were already here. well, that may be a very dangerous mistake, both for her and for you. this for you. this affair, if it goes on for a few days more,"
1680,7067-76047-0048.flac, and at present the world and world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment. that is the core of this situation. a pause fell between the two gentlemen.
1681,7067-76047-0014.flac," i shall be sorry all the same. i could have——tame. i could have wished,"" said the doctor, that these ladies had happened a little later. the matter was settled. nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said."
1682,7067-76047-0025.flac," i suppose her father adores and neglects her, and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butchered, i say, and you know, a governess butchered, the thing has been done. these business-americans, i am told, neglect their women kind, give them money and power, let them loose on the world."
1683,7067-76047-0043.flac," grow testically, lay, lay, lay, happen,"" he said. she knows nothing of martin leeds. you must remember that. and then, he added, if she and you fall in love,"
1684,7067-76047-0034.flac," harsh educational experience and very experience and very profound mental disturbance. there have been love experiences, experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there."
1685,7067-76047-0026.flac," it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection. still, i suppose custom-in-tradition kept this girl in her place, and she was petted, honored, amused,"
1686,7067-76047-0027.flac," talked about, but not in a harmful way, and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war. theoretically, she had a tremendously good time. i think this must be near the— truth of her biography, said sir richmond."
1687,7067-76047-0011.flac, am i said aye? said aye said dr. martin o and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grimmont for a day or so sir richmond admitted so sir richmond admitted so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party
1688,7067-76047-0032.flac," what do you think she found? what would a rich girl find out there in america? i don't know. i haven't the material to guess with. in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active, interesting men, rising politicians, university men of distinction,"
1689,7067-76047-0028.flac," i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her, or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her, or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them."
1690,7067-76047-0046.flac," from the psychologist of a new age, i find this amazing. are men and women to go on forever, separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds?"
1691,7067-76047-0003.flac," she could, for example, be left behind with a luggage and sent on by train. i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter. it needs only a word to misgremont. there was no immediate reply."
1692,7067-76047-0038.flac," she sees history as history as you see it, and i see it. she is a very grown-up young woman."" ""'it's just that,' said sir richmond. ""'it's just that. if you see as much and misgremont as all that, why don't you want to come on with us? you see the interest of her?'"
1693,7067-76047-0012.flac," there were some moments of silence, silence, silence. i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma,"" said sir richmond, with a note note of genuine regret in his voice. he just nod to dilemma. said dr. martin lemma. said dr. martin lemma. said dr. martin o, with a corresponding loss of disparity."
1694,7067-76047-0037.flac," that, i think, is why i think, is why history has become real to her. which so attracts you and her. history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents. it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on."
1695,7067-76047-0023.flac," well, she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready-made solutions. that is how i inferred that there was no mother. i don't think there has been any stepmother."
1696,7067-76047-0022.flac," now, i guess this miss gromont has had no mother since she was quite little."" ""'your guesses, doctor, are apt to be pretty good,' said sir richmond. ""'you know that?' she has told me as much.'"
1697,7067-76047-0040.flac," seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity. see, miss gromont has an impulsive and adventurous character. and as i have been saying, she was a spoiled child with no discipline."
1698,7067-76047-0009.flac," she doesn't strike you, does she? as an undignified or helpless human being? her man... her man is suggest a person of considerable self-control. and... and knowing less of me than you do. she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt, say."
1699,7067-76047-0044.flac," as the phrase goes, what is to follow? there was a pause. sirichman looked at his toes for a moment or so, as if he took counsel with them, and then decided to take offense."
1700,7067-76047-0005.flac, so richmond said nothing. it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seaford has asked me if you were a married man. and of course you told her i was.
1701,7067-76047-0016.flac," and honor than they have ever been before. in matters of property, economics and public conduct, it will probably be just the river and just the river and just the reverse. then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence, legal insistence upon individual responsibility."
1702,7067-76047-0045.flac," really, he said. this is preposterous. you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that. and the gulf in our ages, our ages, our ages, in our quality."
1703,7067-76047-0013.flac," i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience. but before i suggested this—justed this—justed this trip, i had intended to spend a little time with my own friends, or can i am latter at bournemouth. nothing simpler than to go to him now."
1704,7067-76047-0008.flac," but isn't your attitude rather unfair? unjust indeed, and almost insulting to this misgramount? after all, she's a young lady, a very good social position indeed."
1705,7067-76047-0035.flac," and something more than that. what it is, is i don't know. the war has turned an ugly face to her. she has seen death and suffering and ruin. perhaps she has seen people she knew killed. perhaps the man has been killed."
1706,7067-76047-0021.flac," missyford is a fairly crude mixture of frankness, insincere, frankness, insincereity, and self-explanatory egotism. and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me."
1707,7067-76047-0015.flac," but neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision. ""'when the new age is here,' said sir richmond, ""'then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the— ""'the inconveniences your present code would set about it?'"
1708,7067-76047-0039.flac," i see a lot more than that. you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am, rather cold and unresponsive to women, and unattractive and negligible. negligible, that is the exact word to them. you can't look at a woman for five minutes."
1709,7067-76047-0047.flac, is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion? you ought to know even better than i do that there is not. for such people as you too anyhow.
1710,7067-76047-0030.flac," probably bored her more than she realized. to anyone, to be intelligent, to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things, and dancing and playing games, and playing games, and playing games, and going to places of entertainment, and being given flowers, sweets, jewelry."
1711,7067-76047-0001.flac, a broad and original thinker as you are.
1712,7067-76047-0017.flac," but we are not living in a new age yet. we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one. and you, if you will forgive me, are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications."
1713,7067-76047-0002.flac," and bit his lower lip and considered, we might drop belinda. he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones. she is quite a manageable person. quite."
1714,7067-76047-0049.flac," they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation, and there was very little more to be said. well, said siritchman in conclusion, i am very sorry indeed, marteno."
1715,7067-76047-0000.flac," after 24 eventful hours, our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room. they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension."
1716,5678-43303-0019.flac," she was not offended, for she trusted her husband too well, but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating. the old lady, too, seemed to be excited. she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks, and hardly smiled at all to the girls greeting."
1717,5678-43303-0003.flac, she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight. the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body. the old lady was so tranquil and human.
1718,5678-43303-0009.flac," she asked, no, no, she may live ten years, i said. he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and when a sh- sh- sh- sh- injector and when away. the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand."
1719,5678-43303-0018.flac," he seemed to move it something and mabel looked at him in astonishment. it is not eastern news, she asked. his eyebrows wrinkled a little."
1720,5678-43303-0017.flac," he will, will he not? you have not heard?"" mr. brandt said he would be here for a late dinner. he will reach slundered at 19. and is there any other news? he compressed his lips. there are rumors, he said. mr. brandt wired to me an hour ago."
1721,5678-43303-0013.flac," back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all and all to itself. those, back off. those same notes would be struck again, were being struck again even now all over the world, though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch."
1722,5678-43303-0031.flac, he had often been later than this. he might have missed the volour he meant to catch. the convention might have been prolonged. he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire.
1723,5678-43303-0036.flac, i am back all as well. now listen. i am well. now listen. now listen. can you hear? yes. yes. the best has happened. it is all over in the east. thelsenberg has done it. now listen. i cannot come home tonight. it will be announced in paul's house in two hours from now.
1724,5678-43303-0006.flac," her whole point, so to speak, lay in the delicate little fabric of personality, built out of fragile things, into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts. the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion."
1725,5678-43303-0004.flac," so absorbed in small external matters, so small external matters, so small external matters, so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth, so utterly with, so without resentment or pivishness."
1726,5678-43303-0010.flac," well, my dear, dear, dear, dear,"" she asked. it is just a little weakness, mother. you must like quiet and do nothing. shall i reach you? no, my dear, i will think a little. it was no part of mabel's idea to duty, to tell her that she was in danger."
1727,5678-43303-0005.flac," she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul. for in that case, she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things."
1728,5678-43303-0011.flac," for there was no past to set straight, no judge to be confronted. death was an ending, not a beginning. it was a peaceful gospel. at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come."
1729,5678-43303-0023.flac, and he had given her no news of the paris convention. he only repeated that mr. oliver would be back that night. then he had gone off in a hurry half an hour later. the old lady seemed to sleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her.
1730,5678-43303-0038.flac," yes, quick! mother is ill. shall i leave? leave? leave her? how ill? oh, no immediate danger. the doctor has seen her. there was silence for a moment. yes, come in. we will go back tonight anyhow, then."
1731,5678-43303-0034.flac," oliver hated interference, and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety. then, even as she turned away, the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight. white hull. she pressed the corresponding button, and her hand shaking so much,"
1732,5678-43303-0025.flac, as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except the effect that the convention would that the convention would close that afternoon. 20 o'clock came but there was no there was no son of oliver the paris baller should have arrived an hour before.
1733,5678-43303-0026.flac, but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one.
1734,5678-43303-0030.flac," i dare say he may be captain paris. the old face on the p- i can pillow not at a murmur, and mabel went down again. it was now an hour after dinner time. oh, there were a hundred things that might have kept him."
1735,5678-43303-0015.flac," mr. phillips arrived the next morning morning as usual, just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her. she is a little better, i think,"" said mabel. she must be very quiet all day. the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room."
1736,5678-43303-0028.flac," turning again and again to the window, listening to the soft rush of the church, the trains, the faint hoots from the track, and the musical cords from the junction a mile away. the lights were up by now, and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairy-lad between the earthly light and the light of the night."
1737,5678-43303-0007.flac," the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace. it is synchipé,"" said the doctor when it came in. she may die at any time. she may live ten years. there is no need to telegraph from mr. brand."
1738,5678-43303-0029.flac," and the heavenly darkness. why did not oliver come, or at least let her know why he did not? once she went upstairs, miserably anxious herself, to reassure the old lady and found an old lady and found her again very drowsy. he is not come, she said."
1739,5678-43303-0037.flac, we are communicating with the press. come up here to meet me at once. you must be present. can you hear? oh yes. come then at once. it will be the greatest thing in history. tell no one. come before the rush begins in half an hour the way will be stopped. oliver.
1740,5678-43303-0021.flac," he will be back to dinner, will he not? if the volour is not, not, not late. your mother, are you ready for breakfast? mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation. it was certain that something had happened."
1741,5678-43303-0022.flac," the secretary, who breakfasted with her in the partler looking onto the garden, had appeared strangely excited. he had told her, this hold her, this hold her, that he would be away the rest of the day. mr. oliver had given him his instructions. he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question,"
1742,5678-43303-0014.flac," but that particular emotion was gone. it was foolish to think that it was foolish to think that it was sounding internally else elsewhere for. there was no elsewhere. she too, herself, would cease one day, let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely."
1743,5678-43303-0012.flac," so the girl went downstairs once more. here's once more, with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still. what a... what a... what a strange and beautiful thing death was, she told herself, this resolution of a cord that had hung suspended for... had hung suspended for 30, 50 or 70 years,"
1744,5678-43303-0002.flac," and mabel running upstairs in an alarm and an alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair. it is nothing, my dear,"" said the old lady tremealously, and she added the description of a symptom or two."
1745,5678-43303-0027.flac," of course, she might have missed it. there was no depending on its exact course, but she had seen it a hundred times before, and wondered un reasonably why she had not seen it now. but she would not sit down to dinner and paste up and down in her white dress."
1746,5678-43303-0000.flac," mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch, and for a few days did her best. but there was nothing that alarmed her. the old lady was a little quiet, perhaps, but went about her minute affairs as usual. she asked the girl to read to her sometimes,"
1747,5678-43303-0032.flac," he might even have wired to mr. phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message. she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it. there it was, that round silent month, that little row of labeled buttons."
1748,5678-43303-0001.flac," she packed his bag with her, bag with her own hands, set out his furs for the swift flight to paris, and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction. he would be gone three days, he said. it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill."
1749,5678-43303-0024.flac," neither did she like to leave the house, so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing, to the long shadow lay across the path, and the tumble platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west."
1750,5678-43303-0033.flac," she had decided to touch them one by one, and in choir whether anything had been heard of her husband. there was his club, his office in whitehall, mr. phillips' house, parliament's house, and the rest, but she hesitated, telling herself to be patient."
1751,5678-43303-0020.flac," said mabel, old mrs. brand looked at her sharply, but her sharply and instant but said nothing. don't excite, such, such, such a soft mother, oliver will be back tonight."" the old lady drew a long breath. don't trouble about me, my dear,"" she said. i shall do very well now."
1752,5678-43303-0035.flac," that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear, she listened. who is there?"" her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice, tiny and manoeuvre across the miles of wire. i, mabel, she said, alone here."
1753,5678-43303-0008.flac, he made a little deprecating movement with his hands. it is not certain that she will die.
1754,5678-43303-0016.flac," where a heap of letters lay, where a heap of letters lay, where a heap of letters lay to be answered. a couple of hours later, as mabel went upstairs, upstairs, upstairs once more, she met mr. phillips coming down. he looked a little flushed under his soloskin. mrs. brand sent for me, he said. she wished to know whether mr. oliver would be back tonight."
1755,5678-43302-0024.flac," but she could see what she loved to see, that response to her own heart. and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more. and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs."
1756,5678-43302-0019.flac," but after this, well, after this, well, after this, well, well, we have shown that we can shed our blood to. it is in the neck of time too, just at the crisis. i don't want to exaggerate. it is only a scratch, but it was so deliberate in."
1757,5678-43302-0031.flac, tell me some more.
1758,5678-43302-0033.flac," these new benin shine explosives will make certain of that. but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them? absolutely. benin shines sold them simultaneously to east and west, then he died, luckily for him. maybe i had heard this kind of talk before."
1759,5678-43302-0027.flac," no, my dear, you're excited and tot-tot-tired. it's just a little sentiment. oliver, i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her. but she hears it everywhere now. no, she doesn't. remember."
1760,5678-43302-0037.flac," half as much again as the rest of the world, half world, world, but together, and the conclusion to be drawn from these premises was not reassuring to england. but imagination simply refused to speak. the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day."
1761,5678-43302-0035.flac," now, if tales were true, entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell. the new conditions were unimaginable. military experts proficied extravagantly. contradicting one another on vital points."
1762,5678-43302-0018.flac," my dear, i feel very downcast sometimes, as you know. well, i do not think i shall be again. i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit, and that the old toys were partly right. when they prophesied, what communism would do?"
1763,5678-43302-0025.flac," all of her stirred presently. did you notice anything just now, sweetheart, when i said that about jesus christ? she stopped knitting for a moment, said the girl. he nodded. you saw that too, then."
1764,5678-43302-0028.flac," she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years. well, watch her, won't you? by the way, yes? there's a little more news from the east, from the east. they say felsenberg's running the whole thing now. the empire is sending him everywhere."
1765,5678-43302-0029.flac," toe-bolts, cabanares, yakuts, everywhere, and he's been to australia."" mabel set up briskly. ""'isn't that very hopeful?' i suppose so. there's no doubt that the sufis are winning, but for how long is another question"
1766,5678-43302-0036.flac," the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory. the theory. the theory. there were no precedents with which to compare it. it was to compare it. it was to compare it. it was as if archers disputed as to the results of cordect. only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine, and as regards male population,"
1767,5678-43302-0022.flac," if they would not be such heavy fools, they don't understand. they don't understand. yes, oliver? they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is, humanity, life. truth at last. and the death of folly, but haven't i told them a hundred times?"
1768,5678-43302-0030.flac," besides, the troops don't disperse. in europe? europe is arming as fast as possible. i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris. i must go. you are arm my dear. my arm must get well. it will have to go with me anyhow."
1769,5678-43302-0021.flac," if only this infernal eastern affair would end. if he knew he was feverish and irritable. and made a great effort to drive it down. oh, my dear, he went on flush to little."
1770,5678-43302-0016.flac," of course not, my darling. what is it? what do you think will be the effect? he raised himself a little, looking out as usual through the darkening windows onto that astonishing view."
1771,5678-43302-0020.flac," and so dramatic the poor devil could not have, devil could not have chosen a worse moment. people won't forget it. mabel's eyes shone with pleasure. you poor deer, she said. are you in pain? not, not much besides christ."
1772,5678-43302-0023.flac," she loved to see him like this, his confident, flushed face, his confident, flushed face, the enthusiasm in his blue eyes, and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with patch, patch, patch, patch, and she bent forward and kissed him suddenly. my dear, i am so proud of you, oh, oliver. he said nothing."
1773,5678-43302-0034.flac," but her imagination simply refused to grasp it. a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing. there had been no european war within a living memory. and the eastern wars, but her eastern wars, but her eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions."
1774,5678-43302-0017.flac," everywhere now lights were glowing, a sea of mellow moons just above the houses, and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening. the effect, he said, it can be nothing but good. it was time that something happened."
1775,5678-43302-0038.flac," founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world, well, felt. felsenberg's name appeared more frequently than ever, otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush. nothing suffered very much. trade went on."
1776,5678-43302-0039.flac," european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual. men still built houses, married wives, be gatsons and daughters, did their business and went to the theater for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else. they could neither save nor precipitate the situation."
1777,5678-43302-0026.flac," maybe, do you think she is falling back? oh, she is getting old,"" said the girl, lightly. of course she looks back a little. but you don't think it would be too awful. she shook her head. no."
1778,5678-43302-0040.flac," it was on too large a scale. occasionally, people went mad, people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height, whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained, and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness, but that was all."
1779,5678-43302-0032.flac," and all that kind of thing, but if not, well, if not, there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined."
1780,5678-43302-0000.flac," oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home, leaning back in his chair with one arm bandaged and in a sling. they had not been able to get near him at the time, the excitement in the square had been too fierce."
1781,5678-43302-0005.flac," she said, then she broke off, she broke off and sat back. why did he shoot just then?"" she asked. oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother, but she was knitting tranquilly. then he answered with a curious deliberateness."
1782,5678-43302-0012.flac," the huge electric placards over london had winged out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight. oliver brand wounded, catholic assailant, indignation of the country,"
1783,5678-43302-0014.flac," he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face, and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and hands had clutched and torn at his throat. then the face had pavanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared. oh"
1784,5678-43302-0008.flac," nothing more. he was well dressed, though. oliver leaned back a little weirily and closed his eyes. his arms still throbbed intolerably. but he was very happy at heart. it was, be at heart. it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic."
1785,5678-43302-0006.flac," i said that braith, who had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together. he was a mother. he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second, and they went on again as before."
1786,5678-43302-0004.flac," maybe leaned forward. oliver, i know this sounds stupid of me, but i wish they had not killed him. oliver smiled at her. he knew this tender trait in her. it would have been more perfect if they had not."
1787,5678-43302-0010.flac," caldecott, the prime minister, maxwell, snowford, and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations. and from every part of england, streamed in message after message. it was an immense stroke for the communists."
1788,5678-43302-0015.flac," there was some passion and loyalty left in england. his mother, the mother, the mother got up presently and went out, still without a word, and mabel turned, turned to him, laying a hand on his knee. are you too tired to talk, my dear?"" he opened his eyes."
1789,5678-43302-0007.flac," but he must have meant to do it anyhow. continued oliver. how do they know he was a catholic? ask the girl again. there was a rosary on him, and then he just had time to call on his god. and nothing more is known."
1790,5678-43302-0002.flac," well, there was no chance for a priest this time. mabel nodded slowly. she had read of the man's fate on the placards. he was killed, trampled, and strangled instantly. said oliver. i did what i could. you saw me."
1791,5678-43302-0011.flac," speaking in defense of his principles, it was an incalculable gain for them, and loss for the individualists, that confessors were not all on one side after all."
1792,5678-43302-0001.flac," but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors. he was a catholic, explained the drawn-faced oliver. he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded."
1793,5678-43302-0003.flac," but, well, i dare say it, it was more merciful. but, you did what you could, my dear. said the old lady anxiously from the corner. i called out to them, mother, but they wouldn't hear me."
1794,5678-43302-0009.flac," but he was not sorry to bear pain in such a cause, and it was obvious that the sympathy of england was with him. mr. phillips even now was busy in the next room, answering the telegrams that poured in every moment."
1795,5678-43302-0013.flac," well deserved fate of assassin. he was pleased too that he honestly had done his best to save the man. even in that moment of sudden and acute pain, he hadn't and acute pain, he hadn't and acute pain, he had cried out for a fair trial, but he had been too late."
1796,5678-43301-0024.flac," a couple of women with an old man directly behind, and other faces visible again behind them. their obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction, and she turned resolutely once more to the square. ah, he was working up now to his panagiric."
1797,5678-43301-0019.flac," of this great anniversary. then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present. up. 50 years ago, the speaker said, poverty was still a disgrace. now it was so no longer."
1798,5678-43301-0006.flac, and converge toward the wide railed space about the platform where and a room was reserved for them. the windows on every side were packed with faces. tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and st. martin's church.
1799,5678-43301-0016.flac," the kingdom of god, it was said, lay within the human heart, and the greatest of all graces was charity. she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might, with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure a hundred yards away."
1800,5678-43301-0009.flac," nor the lions, lions to the new art. and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery. overhead, the roofs showed crowded freezes of heads against the blue summer sky."
1801,5678-43301-0021.flac," he enumerated the reforms past fifty years before on this very day, by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate. so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty."
1802,5678-43301-0014.flac," and all england was familiar with it. it's it. old mrs. brand lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes, and saw the words that she knew, and the words that she knew, the words that she knew so well. the lord that dwells in earth and sea."
1803,5678-43301-0017.flac," and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or two across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him. then he stepped back, and oliver came forward. it was too far for the two to hear what was said, but mabel slipped a paper, smiling tremulously,"
1804,5678-43301-0002.flac," and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ. thus, he had pre-looted his speech on the poor law question, pointing to the true charity that existed among masons, apart from religious motives."
1805,5678-43301-0027.flac," the old man at the table was up in a moment. went, went, went, and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were masked and directly opposite the front of the platform."
1806,5678-43301-0000.flac, in his masonic insignia. it was he who had given immense impetus to that secret movement by his declaration in the house that the key of future progress and brotherhood of nations was in the hands of the order.
1807,5678-43301-0010.flac," not less than 100,000 persons it was estimated in the 9th evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon. as the clocks began to tell the hour, two figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward and in an instant."
1808,5678-43301-0012.flac," and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion. behind him came oliver, bareheaded and spruce, and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement."
1809,5678-43301-0020.flac," it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay. who would not honor a man worn out in the service of his country, or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail?"
1810,5678-43301-0015.flac," had been composed with both skill and, had skill and skill and order. they had a religious ring. the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm, yet their sense was plain enough. the old human creed that man was all. even christ's words themselves were quoted."
1811,5678-43301-0025.flac," the tiny dark figure was back, a yard nearer the statue, the twer of the statue, and as she looked, his hand went up and he wheeled, pointing. the pointing has a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice. then again he was forward, half-crowching, for he was a born actor."
1812,5678-43301-0001.flac," it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted. st. paul had been right, he declared, in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations."
1813,5678-43301-0011.flac," the murmurs of talk rose into cheering. old lord pemperdon came first, a gray-haired upright man, whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over seventy years ago, and his son had succeeded him worthily."
1814,5678-43301-0023.flac," old mrs. brand leaned back in her seat and looked about her. the window where they sat had been reserved for them. two arm chairs filled the- arm chairs filled the space, but immediately behind there were others standing very silent now, craning forward, watching, two with parted lips."
1815,5678-43301-0008.flac, the old column was gone with its lions.
1816,5678-43301-0018.flac," into the old lady's hand, in, and herself, been forward to listen. old mrs. brand looked at that, too, knowing that it was an analysis of her son's speech, and to where she would not be able to hear his words."
1817,5678-43301-0007.flac," garden beds of color behind the mute white statues that faced outwards round the square. from brave weight in front, past the victorians, john davidson, john burns, and the rest, round to hampton and to monfort toward the north."
1818,5678-43301-0003.flac," and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak. a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesmen appeared to be one of the speakers, though at a slightly higher elevation."
1819,5678-43301-0005.flac, overpowered now and again by the crash of over- of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds each headed by a banner.
1820,5678-43301-0004.flac," and this platform was hung with roses, surrounded by a sounding board, and set with a chair and table. the whole square roundabout was paved with heads and resonant with sound, the murmurs of thousands of voices."
1821,5678-43301-0013.flac, there was no doubt that these londoners could sing. it was as if it was as if it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody rising rising to enthusiasm till the music of masked bands followed it as a flag as a flag follows a flag stick the him was one composed ten years before
1822,5678-43301-0026.flac, and a storm of laughter rippled around the throng of heads. she heard an in-drawn hiss behind her chair and the next instant an exclamation from mabel. what was that? there was a sharp crack and the tiny just articulating figure staggered back a step.
1823,5678-43301-0022.flac," and its reward, and that, he supposed, together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws, would form the first half of his speech. the second part was to be a panagiric of brave weight, treating him as the precursor of a movement that even now had begun."
1824,5561-41616-0024.flac," they played such a close-guarded game that tries they might, the juniors made no headway, then julia crosby scored on a field goal, making the score 3-2. this spurred the junior team on to greater effort and mary made a brilliant throw to basket that brought forth an ovation from the gallery."
1825,5561-41616-0035.flac," just before the last half started, miss thompson and miss cain came in and walked to the other end of the gallery. well, eleanor and her crowds saw them."
1826,5561-41616-0017.flac," a tall junior who stood up and beat time with both hands. and he composed the song of song the week before. the juniors had all received copies of the words and had learned them by heart. they now sang with the utmost glee and came out particularly strong on the chorus, which ran"
1827,5561-41616-0009.flac," i have been practicing a most encouraging howl. hippie, david, and ready have a new one too. ready says it's marvellously extraordinary and appallingly great."
1828,5561-41616-0011.flac," i feel sure that she didn't, and i'm just as sure that she won't get back until she does. we shall manage to exist if she doesn't suggest a dryly."
1829,5561-41616-0020.flac," and all the baskets soon will land. we shall sing the praises of the seniors. hardly had the last and last notes died away when the referee blew the whistle and the teams hustled to their positions. grace and julia crosb and crosb and crosb faced each other, deemed amably in shook hands."
1830,5561-41616-0031.flac," whose loyal supporters swooped down upon them the moment the was- whose was- the was- the was- the was- the was- the was- the blew and pranced about whooping like savages. that was the greatest game i ever saw played under this roof quite david, ringing grace's hand, while hippie hopped about uttering little yelps of joy."
1831,5561-41616-0001.flac," after conducting, conducting, conducting, opening exercises, ms. thompson pronounced sentence on the culprits. they were to forfeit their recess, library, and all other privileges until the end of the term."
1832,5561-41616-0025.flac," this ended the first half with the score of 5-2 in favor of the juniors. they'll have to work to catch up with his now- now, sidnor o'malley, triumphantly to the members of the team, who's at resting in the little side room off the gymnasium. we have the lead, but we can't afford to boast yet, replied grace."
1833,5561-41616-0015.flac," julia crosby and grace took turns sprinting around the gymnasium three times in succession, while miriam nezbit timed them. grace finishing just two seconds ahead of julia. by a quarter of two, the gallery was fairly well filled, and by five minutes of two, it was crowded."
1834,5561-41616-0005.flac, to as many and many many a year ago in an age beyond recall that nor the freshmen lowly sat
1835,5561-41616-0030.flac," and the sensational playing of nora and miriam was a matter of wonder to the spectators who considered it to be the fastest, most brilliant half-ever and ever and ever played by an oakdale team."
1836,5561-41616-0029.flac," then the senior scored twice on fowls, tying the s**t in the score. the juniors set their teeth and waited in with all their might in maine, setting a whirlwind pace that caused their fans to shed with wild enthusiasm and fairly days their opponents. grace alone knitted four fouls of goals,"
1837,5561-41616-0007.flac," by the way, answer grace. as you are a poet, you are a poet, you must compose a basketball song today. and i'll see that the juniors all have copies. it's time we had one. let me see what would be a good tune. rally round the flank suggested miriam nesbet. that has a dandy swing to it."
1838,5561-41616-0022.flac," and sent it flying and flying toward miriam, who was so carefully guarded that she dared not attempt to make the basket. and after a fain managed to throw it to nora, who tried for the basket at long range and in mist. there was a general scramble for the ball, and for five minutes neither team scored."
1839,5561-41616-0010.flac," wasn't it nice of ms. thompson to exonerate us publicly, asdane? she's always just replied grace. i can't understand how eleanor could be so rude and disagreeable to her. she is disliked ms. thompson from the- the first. i wonder whether she apologized to ms. thompson last night and used grace?"
1840,5561-41616-0023.flac," then mary and barbara dropped a neat field gold and soon after grace scored on a foul. the junior fans howell joyfully at the good work of their team, the seniors did not intend to allow them to score again in a hurry."
1841,5561-41616-0002.flac," they must turn in two themes every week of not less than 600 words, not less than 600 words, uncertain subjects to be assigned to them. if, during this time, any one of them should be reported for a misdemeanor, they were to be suspended without delay."
1842,5561-41616-0032.flac," ready circled about the victors, almost too delighted for words. he was filled with profound admiration for them. the boys cracked team couldn't have played a better game, he said solemnly, and the girls knew that he could pay them no higher compliments. for this team was considered invincible by the high school boys."
1843,5561-41616-0003.flac," their penalty was far from light, but they had not been suspended, and so they resolved to endure it as best they might. grace harlow felt a load lifted from her mind when miss thompson publicly announced that she had not received any information from either maple allison or the pi sigma tower."
1844,5561-41616-0027.flac," where are snora going to the door? oh, oh, oh, yes. i see her. she looks as hot as ever. it's a wonder she'd kinda send to come and watch her mortal enemies play."
1845,5561-41616-0012.flac," she felt a personal grudge against eleanor for her accusation against maple, who had grown very dear to her and whom she moutored like a hen with one chick. she'll probably appear at the game and all her glory said miriam nesbitt."
1846,5561-41616-0036.flac," heart to tell, said nora. i'll say nora. they hissed miss thompson. very softly you may be sure, continue jessica, but it was hissing just the same."
1847,5561-41616-0026.flac," we shall win, said miriam nezbit confidently. i feel it in my bones. let's hope that your bones are true prophets, left mary and barbara. oh, girls exclaimed eva allen from the open door, in which she had been standing looking up at the gallery. allen or is here?"
1848,5561-41616-0019.flac," shouting the war cry of the juniors. there was a great clapping of hands from the admirers of the juniors at this effort, but the seniors promptly responded from the other end of the gallery, shout gallery to the tune of dixie with. the seniors are the real thing, hurrah, hurrah. our gallon team now takes it stand."
1849,5561-41616-0038.flac," she talked for a moment to edna and edna and she and edna and she and eleanor. they tossed their heads, but they didn't hiss anymore. what did ruse say to them, ascray, curiously?"
1850,5561-41616-0016.flac, the juniors with the exception of eleanor seville's faction arrived in a body. give the high school y'all the moment they spy their team.
1851,5561-41616-0021.flac," then stood vigilant, eyes on the ball that the referee balanced in her hands. up it went, the whistle sounded and the two captain sprang straight for it. grace captured it, however."
1852,5561-41616-0037.flac, they were sitting down front on the same side as eleanor's crowd. they were crowd. they were crowd. you know what a temper ruth dean has and how ferocious she can look.
1853,5561-41616-0000.flac," 16. the juniors forever when the four classes assembled thursday morning, every girl with the exception of eleanor was in her seat."
1854,5561-41616-0014.flac," and rapidly dawned their gymnasium suits. the spectators had not yet begun to arrive as it was still early, so the girls indulged in a little warming up practice, did a few stunts and skipped about, overflowing with animal spirits."
1855,5561-41616-0004.flac," thank goodness, none of us were concerned in that affair she told the members of her basketball team at recess. there are two girls in the sophomore and three in the freshman team. this basketball order will have to cool until after the mid-year exams."
1856,5561-41616-0028.flac," then we'll see that she goes away in a glimmer frame of mindset, nora, for we're going to win and don't you forget to remember it."
1857,5561-41616-0018.flac," the juniors forever, hurrah fans, hurrah, our team is a winner."
1858,5561-41616-0013.flac, the recess bell cut short the conversation and the girls return to their desk desk desk with far far far better ideas of the coming game than of the afternoons lessons. saturday december 12 dawned cold and clear as the girls and both both teams were in high spirits as they hustled into their respective locker rooms.
1859,5561-41616-0008.flac," grace hummed a few bars. the very thing she exclaimed, now anne, get busy at once. you better sing the tune to yourself all the time you're writing it."
1860,5561-41616-0006.flac," what a delicate way of reminding me that i once was a freshman she exclaimed. anne has a new accomplishments at grace, she can spout poetry without trying. small credit credit is due me said anne smiling. anyone can twist anne a ballie to suit the occasion."
1861,5561-41616-0034.flac," glad to know that, say grace. there were so many different kinds of noises i couldn't have- lens of noises i couldn't- lens of noises i couldn't distinguish it. there was one noise that started that was promptly hushed, said anne. you heard it too, didn't you jessica? oh yes girls, i intended telling you before this, reply jessica."
1862,5561-41616-0033.flac," perhaps we'll challenge you someday, ready, sir grace. for grace, grace mischievously. i believe you'd win at that, he said so honestly, that everyone laughed. it was a great triumph, sir jessica proudly, as she stood with mabel and anne in the locker room while the girls resumed street clothing, and my new howell was a success, too."
1863,5561-39621-0042.flac," no, no, i have two arms, perry, and i have a sword. and he struck his arm violently with his hand and took down his sword, which hung against the wall."
1864,5561-39621-0044.flac," and with these words, which he finished sharply with a nervous and terrible laugh, the young man girded it on his sword, took his hat from the trunk."
1865,5561-39621-0045.flac," my good perry said he, order a fire, drink, eat, sleep, and be happy. let us both be happy, my faithful friend, my only friend. we are rich as riches kings."
1866,5561-39621-0040.flac," well, well, my lord said, perry, more uneasy at the turn of the conversation had taken than at the other. you never assume the unknown that my mother and my sister, will all this is going on in honor of the king of france, have neither money nor bread. you know that i, my soul shall be poor and degraded within a fortnight."
1867,5561-39621-0038.flac," all these trumpets are his, all those gilded housings are his, all those gentlemen wear swords that are his. his mother proceeds him in a carriage magnificently encrossed with silver and gold. happy mother!"
1868,5561-39621-0036.flac, what is the meaning of all the noise which preceded me? what are these people crying? viva la roy? or what king do they mean?
1869,5561-39621-0034.flac," perry, is that all? is that all? yes, my lord. that is all. after this brief reply, and so do long interval of silence, broken only by the convulsive breeding of the heal of the young man on the floor."
1870,5561-39621-0039.flac, and conducts him to a rich bride. then all these people rejoice. they love their king.
1871,5561-39621-0043.flac," what am i going to do, perry? what everyone in my family does. my mother lives in public charity. my sister begs for my mother. i have somewhere or other brothers who equally beg for themselves. and i, the eldest, will go and do as all the rest do. i will go and ask charity."
1872,5561-39621-0037.flac," ah, perry replied the young man ironically."
1873,5561-39621-0033.flac," these cavaliers conducted me in great haste to the little port of tenby. thru me, rather than embarked me into a little fishing boat, about to sell for brittany. and here i am. o, side the young man, clasping his net convulsively with his hand and with a sob."
1874,5561-39621-0041.flac," perry are there not examples in which a man of my condition should himself, my lord, in the name of heaven?"
1875,5561-39621-0032.flac," the young man leaned forward, thoughtful and sad. i, that's what he did before his people, said he, endeavouring to cheat himself with hopes. but privately, between you and him, what did he do? answer."
1876,5561-39621-0035.flac, the old man endeavored to change the conversation. it was leading to thoughts much too sinister.
1877,5561-39621-0010.flac, with cropoly were mingled and jostled on the staircase.
1878,5561-39621-0008.flac," the unknown asked for a glass of wine, broke off a morsel of bread, and did not stir from the window whilst he ate and drank."
1879,5561-39621-0028.flac," but in the name of heaven do not tremble so. it is in patience, perry. come, what did the general say to you? at first the general would not receive me."
1880,5561-39621-0031.flac," what? a rest... you, my most faithful servant? yes, my lord. and notwithstanding you, it's notwithstanding you, it's signed the name, perry, to all my letters, my lord."
1881,5561-39621-0015.flac," and 20 other courtiers followed by their people in their baggage, closed this veritably triumphant march. the pomp was of a military character."
1882,5561-39621-0019.flac," all the noise, all the splendor had passed away. at the angle of the street there remained nothing but beneath the stranger, but a few horse-discordant voices shouting at intervals. vive le roy!"
1883,5561-39621-0009.flac," cries arose in the distance. a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city, and the first distinct sounds that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses."
1884,5561-39621-0011.flac," the quattaraj advanced slowly, lighted by a thousand flambo in the streets and from the windows."
1885,5561-39621-0005.flac," pay yourself at the unknown. i will do someone's ear since you so positively require it. a sad smile passed over the lips of the gentleman. place the money on that trunk, said he, turning round and pointing to the piece of furniture."
1886,5561-39621-0018.flac," the popular acclimations deafened him. for a moment he allowed his, the piss reason to be absorbed in this flood of lights, tumult and brilliant images. he is a king murmured he in an accent of despair. then, before he had recovered from his sombre reverie,"
1887,5561-39621-0007.flac, dinner has already been refused.
1888,5561-39621-0004.flac," nevertheless, i made it a condition of the bargain, never the bargain, that if monsieur wished to keep his diamond, it should be held to monsieur's again in funds. oh no, not at all, i told you to sell it."
1889,5561-39621-0024.flac," never! harry cry the gentleman, i beg you will. you will. you come from england, you come so far. ha, it is not for your age to undergo the fatigue my service requires. rest yourself. i have my reply to give you, lord, shape in the first place."
1890,5561-39621-0000.flac, chapter 7. parry.
1891,5561-39621-0003.flac," whispered, munsuya, the diamond has been valued. ah, so the traveler. well? well munsuya, the jeweler of sar, gives 280 pastolles for it. have you them? i thought it best to take the munsuya."
1892,5561-39621-0029.flac," yes, my lord, but i wrote him a letter. well, he read it and received me, my lord. did that letter thoroughly explain my position in my views? oh, yes, said perry with a sad smile. it painted your very thoughts faithfully. well then, perry."
1893,5561-39621-0027.flac," i do not despair, perry. have you fathened my resignation? the old man raised his trembling hands towards heaven. i have it. i have it. let me know, said the stranger. disguise nothing from me. i need what has happened. my recital will be short, my lord."
1894,5561-39621-0014.flac," the young prince exhibited when bowing to some windows from which issued the most animated acclimations, a noble and handsome continence, illuminated by the flumbo of his pages. by the side of the king, though a little in the rear,"
1895,5561-39621-0002.flac, the stranger did not pay them the least attention.
1896,5561-39621-0006.flac, after having taken from it the amount of his reckoning.
1897,5561-39621-0021.flac," cropulli was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks, without observing that an old man on foot, but leading a small irish horse by the bridle, was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the entrance of the medici. but at that moment, the voice of the stranger was heard from the window."
1898,5561-39621-0017.flac," when the king passed before him, the unknown, who had lent ford over the balcony to obtain a better view, and who had concealed his face by leaning on his arm, felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter jealousy. the noise of the trumpets excited him."
1899,5561-39621-0030.flac," then the general sent me back the letter by an aide to comp, informing me that if i were found the next day within the circumscription of his command, he would have me arrested."
1900,5561-39621-0022.flac," make way monstros de la hotelier, to the entrance of your house."
1901,5561-39621-0025.flac," my lord said the old man, do not hasten to alarm yourself, all is not lost, i hope. you must employ energy, but more particularly resignation. perry said the young man, i have reached this place through a thousand snares and after a thousand difficulties."
1902,5561-39621-0016.flac," were traveling dresses, but all the rest were clothed in warlike panapoli."
1903,5561-39621-0023.flac, the window was instantly closed. petrino pointed out the... petrino pointed out the way to the newly arrived guest. who... the newly arrived guest. who... the newly arrived guest. who entered without uttering a word. the stranger waited for him on the landing. he opened his arms to the old man and led him to his seat.
1904,5561-39621-0020.flac," how good looking the king is, how strongly he resembles his illustrious father. a handsome likeness at petrino."
1905,5561-39621-0012.flac, drawn like a carriage by four black horses.
1906,5561-39621-0013.flac, her gentleman on horseback at both sides. the king then appeared mounted upon a splendid horse of sacks and breed with a flowing mane.
1907,5561-39621-0026.flac, can you doubt my energy? i have meditated this journey 10 years in spite of all councils and all obstacles. have you faith in my perseverance?
1908,5561-39621-0001.flac, and landing an ear to the various noises.
1909,5561-41615-0016.flac," i was therefore astonished to learn that a number of girls, regardless of the rules, have taken matters into their own hands and have decided to absent themselves from school tomorrow in order to attend the matinee to be given in the theater."
1910,5561-41615-0028.flac, words cannot express my contempt for them. and right here i accused grace harlow and her sorority of getting the information from mabel allison yesterday and carrying it to you. they are all tail bearers and sneaks.
1911,5561-41615-0019.flac," and that a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils who pledge themselves to play truant in attend the matinee tomorrow. the eyes of grace and her chums turned questionally toward mabel allison, who nodded slightly in the affirmative. so that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant."
1912,5561-41615-0026.flac," if you have that paper in your possession, bring it to me at once. and never answer me again as you did just now. you are both disrespectful, disrespectful, and impertinent. but miss thompson's anger toward eleanor was nothing compared with the tempest that the principal had aroused in eleanor."
1913,5561-41615-0027.flac," the latter flushed, then turned perfectly white with rage. still standing, she reached down."
1914,5561-41615-0030.flac," i will not tolerate such behavior."" eleanor gleirard at the principal, whose face was rigid in its purpose, then sank into the nearest vacant seat, saying, defiantly, you may keep me here all night if you like."
1915,5561-41615-0018.flac," the standard of the school will be lowered. therefore, i intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous influence prompted this act of insubordination. report says that this movement originated in the junior class."
1916,5561-41615-0045.flac," but there was nothing funny about it now. when with the exception of eleanor, the principal dismissed them, they followed decoriously out, very uneasy in mind. ms. thompson had taken their names, but had not stated their punishment, and it was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure."
1917,5561-41615-0003.flac," at recess, there was more grouping and whispering, and grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored. such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year."
1918,5561-41615-0031.flac," nevertheless, she did not again attempt to leave the room. she... ...room. she had met with the will stronger than her own, and she realized it. ignoring eleanor's final remark, miss thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand."
1919,5561-41615-0014.flac," that i find hard to credit, but before you leave here this afternoon, i must know who is innocent and who is guilty. ms. thompson paused, and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats, while a few glanced quickly toward eleanor who was looking straight ahead, the picture of innocence."
1920,5561-41615-0000.flac, chapter 15. a woodbeard lark
1921,5561-41615-0034.flac," grace was thoroughly angry with her. she could not forgive eleanor for having accused her and her friends of caring tales before almost the entire school. therefore, a forced apology would not have peace her wounded pride."
1922,5561-41615-0017.flac, such a decision is worse than disobedience. it is lawlessness.
1923,5561-41615-0044.flac, and the tear of suspension arose in more than one mind as they listened to her scathing remarks.
1924,5561-41615-0043.flac," gabai grace coerced her friends and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of the fate of the great of the woodbeat fruits. to return to those youthful transgressors, they were spending a most uncomfortable half hour with miss thompson. she was merciless in her denunciation of their conduct."
1925,5561-41615-0025.flac," because it has spoiled all our fun. there was a gasp of horror at eleanor's assertion, no one had ever before spoken so disrespectively to the revered principal. miss seval said the principal quietly, although her flashing eyes and set lips show that she was very angry."
1926,5561-41615-0009.flac, i can't bear to have secrets and not tell you.
1927,5561-41615-0036.flac," the girls suddenly donned their raps and fled from the building like fugitives from justice. once on the street, a lively confab and sood all talking at once. let's... ...once. let's... ...once. let's take turns talking, craig gray's laughing. we shall understand each other a little better."
1928,5561-41615-0008.flac," and did you sign it as jessica? i certainly did not respond to maple. it was, she stopped and flushed."
1929,5561-41615-0024.flac," i wrote it miss thompson, she said clearly. i wrote it because i wished to."
1930,5561-41615-0015.flac," that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus, matinee, or any public performance of this nature. i have so severely disciplined pupils for this offense that for a long time no one has disobeyed me."
1931,5561-41615-0035.flac," she drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door. hurry up, she said. we'll talk when we get outside school. don't stop for a minute. if miss thompson notices that we're gone, she'll send after us."
1932,5561-41615-0004.flac," eleanor started that paper, started that paper, whatever it is said nora o'malley of the pysigmatown who stood in a group around her desk. she was here when i came in this morning and i was early too."
1933,5561-41615-0022.flac," her example was followed until two-thirds of the girl's present were standing. the principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly disconfidding. that will do, she said, currently."
1934,5561-41615-0005.flac, here comes mabel's suggestica. maybe she has seen the paper.
1935,5561-41615-0041.flac," no say, grace, grace, shortly. she deserves to be punished. the thing she said to ms. thompson were disgraceful, and i shall never forgive her for the way she spoke of us. i wouldn't say that grace remarked anne. you can never tell what may happen to change your views."
1936,5561-41615-0002.flac," and as the morning advance, they became fully aware that something unusual was in the wind. so at all times they caught sight of a folded paper being stealthily passed from one desk to another, but as to its contents they had no idea, as it was not handed to any one of them."
1937,5561-41615-0039.flac," it was passed to me by mistake. very likely, i agree, grace. i wonder who did tell ms. thompson? i saw several goals with the paper."
1938,5561-41615-0010.flac," we don't want you to tell. if it doesn't concern us, we don't care. do we don't care? do we girls?"" no indeed was the reply. just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved."
1939,5561-41615-0047.flac," do you intend to obey me, miss seval, ask miss thompson? still, there was no answer. very well, continue miss thompson. your silence indicates that you are still in subordinate. you may therefore choose between two things."
1940,5561-41615-0020.flac, grace and really congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing. none of her friends were implicated either. even mabel had refused to sign.
1941,5561-41615-0042.flac," it will have to be something remarkable in this instance for applied grace, scrimmly, as she bade the girls goodbye. remember girls, basketball practice again tomorrow, and the rest of the week. ms. thompson has promised me the gymnasium. please make it a point to be on hand."
1942,5561-41615-0006.flac," mabel nodded. what was written on it, mabel? ask grace curiously. mabel asked grace curiously. mabel looked distressed for a moment. then she said,"
1943,5561-41615-0038.flac, i suppose it did look as though i told you girls said maybe allison who would join them at the gate. you know i was with you at recess right after the paper had been passed to me.
1944,5561-41615-0029.flac," with these words, ellen or angerly flung the book she held on the desk. we held on the desk and walked down the aisle towards the door, but ms. thompson barred her way. stop ms. seville, she commanded."
1945,5561-41615-0021.flac," what i assist upon knowing now, well now, is who are the real culprits, beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it."
1946,5561-41615-0048.flac, you may apologize to me now and tomorrow to the girls you have accused of treachery.
1947,5561-41615-0033.flac," grace motioned the girls to hurry. she wished to leave the room with her friends before ms. thompson noticed them. she knew the principal would insist on an apology from eleanor, and either she nor her friends wished it. for the first time since eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance,"
1948,5561-41615-0040.flac, they will be weeping and whaling in the skull and crossbones crowd exclaim norah. they are all in this mix up and if they aren't suspended they'll be lucky.
1949,5561-41615-0046.flac," when the last girl had disappeared, the principal turned to eleanor."
1950,5561-41615-0012.flac," dismissed the senior senior class and requested the three level classes to remain in their seats. after the seats, after the business seats, after the seniors had quietly left the study hall, ms. thompson stood gravely regarding the rows of girls before her. her eyes wandered toward where ellen or sat, looking bored and indifferent."
1951,5561-41615-0007.flac," but i gave my word of honor before i read it that i wouldn't mention the contents to anyone. then of course we won't, but of course we won't ask you, sid and pearson quickly. but tell us this much. is it about any of us? no replied mabel. it isn't. it is something i was asked to sign."
1952,5561-41615-0001.flac," the majority, however, appeared to be highly delighted over what they- delighted over what they heard. one group, standing near one of the windows, of which eleanor was the center, laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats."
1953,5561-41615-0037.flac," she has certainly shown her true colors this time. i never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her old plans at miriam barber. it was a bominable, bominable, said eva allen. the other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms."
1954,5561-41615-0013.flac," and then she looked towards grace, who looked towards grace, who looked towards grace, who steady, gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention. i don't believe grace is guilty at any rate thought ms. thompson, then she addressed the assembled girls. something has come to my ears, girls, so the principal."
1955,5561-41615-0032.flac, those girls who were not in any way implicated in this matter are just smishy said. about one-third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall. the pie sigma tau being among the number.
1956,5561-41615-0011.flac," on wednesday, aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils, not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall. it was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when miss thompson walked into the room."
1957,5561-41615-0023.flac," after they had stood for what seemed to them in age, but was really only a couple of minutes. you may be seated. the girl who composed and after the girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself. without hesitating, eleanor rose, in regard to the principle with an insolent smile,"
1958,5456-62043-0015.flac," how does that wood burn? inquire the captain of the mate who was looking on it, looking on it, looking on it the game. tisn a much-account, i reckon, answered the mate, mate, mate. it's cottonwood, and most of its green is green at that. well, thompson, three aces again, stranger."
1959,5456-62043-0007.flac," and then a little less than an hour, when our fuel was about giving out, we made the point. and our cables were out and fastened the trees alongside of a good-sized wood pile. hello, colonel. how do you sell your wood this time? a yellow-faced old gentleman."
1960,5456-62043-0003.flac," she must have had a time of it. it was my fate to take passage and she take passage in this boat. the captain was a good natured, easygoing man, careful of the comfort of his passengers, and exceedingly fond of the game of bragg. we had been out a little more than five days."
1961,5456-62043-0012.flac," and there's no other woodyard for 9 miles ahead. and 9 miles ahead. and 9 miles ahead. and if you happen to be nearly out of fuel, why? well, well, interrupted to the captain. we'll take a few quarts under the circumstances. and he returned to his game of brag."
1962,5456-62043-0031.flac," the pilot, with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game, and said in an underton, forty piece for you and i and james, james, james, the other pilot is not bad for one night. i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs."
1963,5456-62043-0022.flac," or if they did venture to call out on two bullets in a braggar, they had the mortification to find one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable. still, with all these disadvantages, they continue playing."
1964,5456-62043-0009.flac," an appointment is mouth, casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening in our spring line answered. why capped in? we must charge e3 in a quarter this time. the devil replied the captain."
1965,5456-62043-0011.flac," would's risk, risk, risk since you went down two weeks ago. besides, you are a whore that you very seldom stop going down."
1966,5456-62043-0023.flac," they wanted to learn the game. at two o'clock, the captain asked the mate how we were getting on. oh, pretty glibly sir replied the mate. we can scarcely tell what headway we are making, for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river, and there is the shadow of a fog rising."
1967,5456-62043-0018.flac," i can't very well leave the game now. it's getting right warm. just pilots beating us all to smash. the wooden completed, we paddled on again. the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard."
1968,5456-62043-0024.flac," this would seem rather better than that we took in yellow faces, but we're nearly out again, and must be looking out for more. i saw a light just ahead on the right, shall we hail? yes, yes, replied the captain. ring the bell and ask him what's the price of wood up here. i've got you again."
1969,5456-62043-0026.flac," the stranger suffers some of the same time. three and a quarter again. are we never to get to a cheaper country? deal, sir, if you please. better luck next time. the other pala's voice was again hurt on deck. how much have you? only about ten chords, sir."
1970,5456-62043-0020.flac," the latter person and just took a turn and turned about, steering and playing bragg. one of them almost invariably winning. while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing, cutting, and paying up their aunties. they were anxious to learn the game."
1971,5456-62043-0030.flac," it appears that two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost $120. the captain, as he rose to see about taking in some good wood, which he felt sure of obtained, obtained, obtained, and now that he had got up above the level country, winked it as a pwnit"
1972,5456-62043-0027.flac," was the reply of the youthful salesman? the captain here told thompson was thompson to take six cords, which would last till daylight, and again turn his attention to the game. the pilots here changed places. when did they sleep? would taken in?"
1973,5456-62043-0013.flac," in about half an hour, we f***ed half an hour, we felt the caravan comments paddling again. supper was over."
1974,5456-62043-0002.flac," avoid from new orleans to vicksburg and back, including vicksburg and back, including stopages, generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages. whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a feat of a vicks of a vicks of a vicks to the falls, louisville, i have never learned. if she did,"
1975,5456-62043-0016.flac," thompson, i say we'd better take three or four chords at the next one. chords at the next one. chords at the next woodyard. it can't be more than six miles from here. two hs is in a braggar with the age."
1976,5456-62043-0037.flac," accompanied by the same layer of the same yellow countenance. why darn it? a darn it all, capped thing? there's but three or four chords left. and since it's you, i don't care if i do let you have it for three, as you're a good customer."
1977,5456-62043-0001.flac," she was regularly advertised as the fast running, etc. regular trips from new orleans to natchez were usually made in from six to eight days. a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable."
1978,5456-62043-0005.flac," sent downward that the maid had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord. the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot, whose watch was below, and the two passengers who made up the party, and hurried to the deck."
1979,5456-62043-0000.flac," a bully boat, and a bragg captain. a story of steamboat life, steamboat life on the mississippi, by saul smith. a little smith smith. does anyone remember the caravan? she was what would now be considered a slow boat. then, 1827."
1980,5456-62043-0014.flac," situated alongside and overlooking the bragg table, where the captain was deeply engaged. having now the other pilot as his principal opponent, we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate."
1981,5456-62043-0036.flac," outcrip from the cottage the veritable faded hat, copperous colored colored pants, yellow countenance, and two weeks beard we had seen the night before."
1982,5456-62043-0034.flac, i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petty coat.
1983,5456-62043-0038.flac," and turned in to take some rest. the fact became apparent, the reader will probably have discovered it sometimes since."
1984,5456-62043-0021.flac, and they did learn it once in a while indeed seeing they had they had they had two aces in a braggar they would venture a bet of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot.
1985,5456-62043-0008.flac," with a two-weeks beard, strings over his shoulders, shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of copper-colored, copper-colored, linsey-woolsy pants, the legs of which reached a very little below the knee, she's without stockings, a faded, broad-brimmed hat, which had once been black."
1986,5456-62043-0006.flac," which he said was situated right round yonder point. but, motor to captain, i don't much like to take wood to take wood of the yellow-faced old scoundrel who owns it. he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than anyone else. however, there's no other chance."
1987,5456-62043-0010.flac," what's the odd quarter-four i should like to know? you only charge me three as i went down. why capped hang, drawed out the wood merchant with a sort of a lear on his yellow countenance, which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold."
1988,5456-62043-0033.flac," and the captain hailed. hello, the woodyard. hello yourself, answer to squeaking female voice, female voice, and female voice, which came from a woman with a pedicote over her shoulders in place of a shawl. what's the price of wood?"
1989,5456-62043-0035.flac," and now you know it. three in the devil broken in the... and in the captain. what have you raised on your wood too? i'll give you three and not a cent more. well, reply the petty coat. here comes the old man. he'll talk to you. and sure enough..."
1990,5456-62043-0029.flac," the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat, which, by his reckoning,"
1991,5456-62043-0028.flac," the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream, paddling on as usual. they at length dawned. the bragg party broke up and settlements were being made, during which operation..."
1992,5456-62043-0032.flac," there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taken in more than 60 yards, so i was disappointed in my expectation. we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood, the banks being invisible from the middle of the river. there it is, exclaimed the captain. stopper."
1993,5456-62043-0017.flac, the game went on and the paddles kept moving. at 11 o'clock it was reported to the captain that we were nearing the woodyard. the light mean distinctly seen by the pilot on duty. pilot on duty. heter ensure then and take in six cords if it's good. see to it thompson.
1994,5456-62043-0019.flac," three and a quarter, quarter quarter quarter. but soon again became interested in the game. from my upper birth, there were no staterooms then. i could observe the movements of the players."
1995,5456-62043-0025.flac," i heard the bell in the pilot's hail. what's your price for wood? a youthful voice on the shore, shore, shore answered. three and a quarter. damn it, ejaculated the captain."
1996,5456-62043-0004.flac," and we were in hopes of seeing the blouse of matches on the next day. our wood was getting low and night coming on. the pilot on duty above, the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the captain who went at strong on three kings."
1997,5456-62014-0002.flac," you chilling as was a denied out house, said the old woman. if you keep some with this sitting up all night business."
1998,5456-62014-0011.flac," i reckon he gets so tired hunting all day, no one he had or blink his eyes to keep him open. but a man he won't satisfy."
1999,5456-62014-0014.flac," and the women stay loud out of turbo screech, because they see, and see, and see, 20 nothing but a big house set in our blinkin'."

2228,5390-24512-0034.flac," that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud, and not the talmud, and not the talmud explanation. the law of moses is like salt, but the talmud is balmy spice, they would say."
2229,5390-24512-0002.flac," had jesus of nazareth been willing, had been willing to become their earthly king, and to lead the nation against the romans, the jews would probably have followed him to a man."
2230,5390-24512-0044.flac," and so on. not only this, but every scribe was required to know from memory exactly how many letters of each kind there should be in his sheet before he began to write. every sheet of parchment must contain an equal number of lines."
2231,5390-24512-0039.flac," before writing any of the names of god, you must wash your pen. before writing his most sacred name, you must wash your whole body. if after your copy has been examined, three corrections have to be made."

2235,5390-24512-0035.flac," yet although they heated so little the true meaning of god's book, they guarded its words, its words more and more carefully, and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict, were strict indeed. my son and old teacher would say to his pupil,"
2236,5390-24512-0015.flac," lifted up their hands to heaven, as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath. the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery."

2243,5390-24512-0046.flac," how tedious and meaningless such information appears of what value were all these details. to spend all his days in learning such things as these could have no influence on a man's character, nor make him a power for good in the world."

2250,5390-24512-0049.flac," just so was it with the hebrew copies of god's word, locked up in a dead language, kept close away from the world. they were like the jar of wheat which could not grow."
2251,5390-24512-0003.flac," the savior sought to heal it. he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centurion, and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesar's,"
2252,5390-24512-0024.flac," which still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine, or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sun beams a struck- with beams a struck-fall on its golden roof. then, which when redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof."

2255,5390-24512-0021.flac," but a furious madness had possessed the people, and they refused to yield. josephus pleaded in vain. he was not a christian, but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people."
2256,5390-24512-0020.flac," hard, merciless as was the roman general, even he grew sick with horror at last, and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews, promising them their lives if they would give up the city."
2257,5390-24512-0016.flac," and he sent a great army against jerusalem, the jews shot the gates of their city, and so began the awful siege of jerusalem. and when he shall see jerusalem compassed with armies,"
2258,5390-24512-0014.flac," the romans believed them, and opened their gates, but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man. as they died, the roman soldiers, whom not even death could terrify,"
2259,5390-24512-0033.flac," so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible. so it's bible. as we have seen, seen, seen, seen, the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god, saw, saw, saw, sawd just as it stood. they had begun even in our lord's day."
2260,5390-24512-0030.flac," the jews were now no longer a nation. they had become merely a body of people, led people, led people, led by their rabbis, or teachers of the law. but they were still the people of the book."
2261,5390-24512-0009.flac," and the history of those years is one long list of terrible risings and massacres, while cities were ruined, villages wrapped in flames, and men, women, and children perished with hunger."
2262,5390-24512-0017.flac," he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem, and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city. his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within."
2263,5390-24512-0042.flac, is the middle of all the words.
2264,5390-24512-0006.flac," had not the jews prevented it. if thou let this man have this man go, thou art not caesar's friend, they cried."
2265,5390-24512-0029.flac," exactly as the lord foretold. there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found, but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers, and is the property of the turkish nation."
2266,5390-24512-0010.flac," yet the keener the suffering, keener the suffering, the more desperate the jews became. their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge."
2267,5390-24512-0008.flac," as their hero, the nation started on their downward road, as the story of the forty years which followed the savior's crucifixion clearly shows. for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke."
2268,5390-24512-0048.flac," while out in the fields, the corn which had, had, had been sown, had grown up and been reaped every year, and men and women had been fed. but this jar, while this jar of corn was useless, because it had been prevented from doing the work in the world for which it was created."
2269,5390-24512-0026.flac," and the golden candlestick, and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen, triumph into heathen rome. alas, for the holy city, over which the savior of the world had stood and wept forty years before,"
2270,5390-24512-0047.flac," nor for this purpose had god revealed his will to man. some years ago, in the coffin of an egyptian mummy, a little jar of wheat was found. for thousands of years it had lain there, shut up in the dark."
2271,5390-24512-0032.flac," over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often. and beside who shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy. a great and beautiful college it was with broad terrorist gardens,"
2272,5390-24512-0041.flac, is the middle letter of all the five books of moses.
2273,5390-24512-0019.flac," that mothers even snatched the bread from their own children's mouths. look over the walls, o people of jerusalem. the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken, and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide."
2274,5390-24512-0028.flac," so the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed, and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own. they have indeed been led away, way, way, way captive into all nations."
2275,5390-24512-0040.flac," that copy must be destroyed. not destroyed. not satisfied with all these directions, the master taught his scholar to count the letters of every book."
2276,5390-24512-0025.flac," pillars fell, beams crumbled to ashes. p-p-p-p-p-p. while round the altar of sacrifice, the people of jerusalem lay heaped-p-p-p together. slain in such numbers in the holy-p-p-p-p, the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream."
2277,5390-30096-0015.flac," that he had been instrumental in founding. being no longer absorbed in business, he had come to the test its every detail, and so allowed his best bankers to care for his fortune, and his brother-in-law to disperse his income."
2278,5390-30096-0019.flac, and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly and kindly and kindly consideration for others that lent her face an indescribable charm. everyone loved patsy doyle.
2279,5390-30096-0026.flac," he replied, what became of the young man asked the girl? he's a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile. where is millville? in quiet uncle john, thoughtfully. somewhere at the north of the state, i believe."
2280,5390-30096-0013.flac," and the welfare and an entertainment of his three nieces. he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of isham, marvin, and company."
2281,5390-30096-0029.flac," for a time he ate with great deliberation and reverberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind. years ago,"
2282,5390-30096-0014.flac," simple in his tastes, modest in his tastes, modest in his tastes, modest and retiring, lacking the education and refinements of polite society, but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world. the little man found his great enjoyment in the family circle."
2283,5390-30096-0025.flac," making five thousand in all. well, nor. well, nor. well, it's gone, john, and you've got the farm. the other fellows were too clever for my young friend, me, my young friend joseph wegg, and knocked out his patent. i'm so sorry, said patsy, sympathetically."
2284,5390-30096-0033.flac, it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years.
2285,5390-30096-0004.flac," and it's the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of. but i'm so glad, cried pantsy, clapping her hands with a delighted gesture, it's a splendid way to do good."
2286,5390-30096-0000.flac," chapter 1 uncle john's, uncle john's farm how did i happen to own a farm? asked uncle john, interrupting his soup, long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major oil, who sat opposite."
2287,5390-30096-0022.flac," he was in a bad fix. another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off. it would take a lot of money to fight back 3,000 at least."
2288,5390-30096-0021.flac," he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market. the thing looked pretty good, john, so i lent him a thousand of your money. quite right. returned uncle john nodding. but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale."
2289,5390-30096-0002.flac," do you do that?"" exclaimed miss patricia doyle, who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both, both, and both. so the major says, answered uncle john dryly, and it's true."
2290,5390-30096-0006.flac," and how can i tell with, how can i tell with, how can i tell whether they're deserving or not retorted me, major, loyal fiercely? do you want me to become a sleuth or engage detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy?"
2291,5390-30096-0032.flac," you talk as if it were a real farm instead. you'd a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift. uncle john looks sober again. anyone live on the place, major? he inquired."
2292,5390-30096-0018.flac," in her plain muslin gown, a stranger would be tempted to wonder why, and why. she was red-haired, freckled as a robin's egg, pug-nosed and wide-mouthed. but her-mouthed, but her blue eyes were beautiful."
2293,5390-30096-0008.flac," but some of them must succeed, ventured patsy, in a conciliatory tone. ""'some do,' said john merrick, and that repays me for all my trouble."""
2294,5390-30096-0023.flac," but he was decent about it, after all. his father had left him a little farm at millville. he couldn't say what it was worth, but there were sixty acres and some good buildings, and he would deed it to you as a security."
2295,5390-30096-0012.flac," that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up, that he up, until he discovered it by accident, then he promptly retired, to give other fellows a chance. and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity,"
2296,5390-30096-0017.flac," patricia was the apple of uncle john's eye, and the one god sent in shriinged in her doting father's heart, glancing at her."
2297,5390-30096-0031.flac," and we can take mary along to do the cooking, suggested passee, entering into the idea enthusiastically. and eden, eden, eden, our shirt sleeves,"" said uncle john, with a glowing face. and have a cow in some pigs? cried the girl."
2298,5390-30096-0007.flac," i just have to form a judgment and take my chances, and when a poor devil goes wrong,"
2299,5390-30096-0016.flac, while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and white-white and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable. he had never married.
2300,5390-30096-0001.flac," replied the major, compositely. it's a part of my duty, in attending to those affairs you won't look after yourself, to lend certain sums of your money, to needy and ambitious young men who want to start in life. oh, uncle!"
2301,5390-30096-0010.flac," with one thing and another. what of it? what of it? what of it? retorted the little round unfazed millionaire, leaning back in his chair and staring fixately at the other. that's what i implore you for. now, now gentlemen, cried patsy earnestly."
2302,5390-30096-0027.flac," have you investigated the f***ing investigated the farm at all? i looked up a real estate dealer living at millville and wrote him about the weg farm. he said if anyone wanted the place very badly it might sell for $3,000. humph."
2303,5390-30096-0024.flac," if you would let him have three thousand more, if three thousand more. so you took the farm and gave him the money. by did sir. perhaps if you did sir, perhaps i am to blame."
2304,5390-30096-0028.flac," but his best information was to the effect, effect that no one wanted it at all. patsy laughed. poor uncle john, she said. the little man, however, was serious."
2305,5390-30096-0011.flac," of his falling down and worshipping him. john merrick was a multi-millionaire to be sure, but there were peleating circumstances that almost excused him. he had been so busily occupied in industry,"
2306,5390-30096-0003.flac, asserted the other. he's the other. he's assisted three or four school young men to start in business in the last year. to my certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars.
2307,5390-30096-0005.flac," without capital, you know, many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder. and many will never get it there in any event,"" declared the major, with a shake of his grizzled head."
2308,5390-30096-0009.flac," query the major. you mean all my trouble? well, and your money."
2309,5390-30096-0020.flac," and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face. she was nearly seventeen years old, not very tall, and her form, to speak charitably,"
2310,5390-30096-0030.flac," beth is still with louise, you know, and they must find the city deadly dull just now, the farms the thing, and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather, and we'll all have a glorious, lazy time."
2311,4853-29413-0022.flac," she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me, for me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life. what is situation for a girl of eighteen?"
2312,4853-29413-0024.flac," how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug? you forget, sir, that i had seen the dog revived by two doses, given it with a space of time between them."
2313,4853-29413-0019.flac," it was born in on my mind, sir, and that's all i can tell you, he said. i didn't dare speak to you about it. you wouldn't have believed me. or if you did believe me, you might have sent for the police."
2314,4853-29413-0026.flac," i should say no, judging by his looks. he turned as looks. he turned as looks. he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall. for once and a once and a once and a way he was honest, honestly frightened, honest, honestly frightened, honest, honestly frightened. i noticed the same things, sir, when he picked me up off the floor."
2315,4853-29413-0018.flac," that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen. by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened, by the experiment on the dog, he was entirely unable to explain."
2316,4853-29413-0027.flac," a man who can change his complexion at will is a man's action at will, is a man we haven't heard of yet, mr. roy lake. i had been dressing for some time past, longing to see crystal. it is needless to say."
2317,4853-29413-0021.flac," that she was true as steel and not easily frightened, that i didn't need to gas. i knew it. gludy had done his best to prepare crystal for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded."
2318,4853-29413-0017.flac," a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed. the last dose was repeated, and the dog soon, soon, soon sprang to his feet again, as lively as ever. gludy was there upon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time"
2319,4853-29413-0023.flac," whatever she saw him drink, she was to insist on your drinking it, too. you heard me ask leave to make the tea? yes. well, that was one of the signals agreed on between us."
2320,4853-29413-0029.flac," while the deaf man lodges at the cottage, he means mischief. cottage, he means mischief, and as i is on miss crystal. early this morning, sir, i happen to be at the boat house. somebody, i leave you to guess who it is, has stolen the oars."
2321,4853-29413-0025.flac," i ought to have remembered this, after what he had already told me. my intelligence brightened a little as i went on. and your accident in the next room was planned, of course, i said."
2322,4853-29413-0030.flac," i was dressed by this time, and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door. what i had just heard brought me back into the room. as a matter of course, we both suspected the same person of stealing the ores."
2323,4853-29413-0028.flac," is there anything more, i asked? i asked, i asked, that i ought to know. only one thing, mr. roy lake, that i can think of, glutee-e-e-e-e applied. i'm afraid it's miss crystal's. i'm afraid it's miss crystal's turn next. what do you mean?"
2324,4853-29413-0031.flac," had we any proof to justify us? gludy at once acknowledged that we had no proof. i happened to look at the boat, he said, and i missed the ores. oh, yes, i searched the boat house. no ores, no ores."
2325,4853-29413-0032.flac," and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me. nothing, sir."
2326,4853-29413-0020.flac," the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief, if murdering mischief it might be, was to trust miss crystal. that she was fond of you. i don't mean any offenser. i pretty well guessed."
2327,4853-29413-0003.flac," the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter. unless i was completely mistaken, here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me, me. gludy showed himself at the door."
2328,4853-29413-0014.flac," to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur- to which the cur regarded me. he had done his best to warn me without- warn me, without- warn me, without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse, and he had failed."
2329,4853-29413-0015.flac," but his resolution to do me good serve us in return for my kindness to him, far from being shaken, was confirmed by circumstances. when his master returned to the chemical studies, which have been already mentioned,"
2330,4853-29413-0009.flac," what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly, too. crystal had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause."
2331,4853-29413-0007.flac," even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he has insulted mr. roy lake. he kicked me. say no more about it, sir. i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you. only i don't know how."
2332,4853-29413-0005.flac," i'm dismissed from my—i'm—i'm—i'm my master's service. that's all. it was plainly not all. relieved even by that guarded reply, i pointed to a chair by the bedside. do you believe that i mean well by you, i asked?"
2333,4853-29413-0008.flac," in this difficulty, he came back to my bedside. look here, sir. what i care, sir. what i care, sir. what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of things i owe him. yes, i say the account between us to is settled now on both sides."
2334,4853-29413-0013.flac," the kerr had betrayed himself. it was a-the-elf. it was a poultry vengeance, ione, to gratify a malicious pleasure-the pleasure-the pleasure, as i did now, in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name, which his morbid humility had suggested,"
2335,4853-29413-0000.flac," gludy settles the account. a night of fever, a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams. this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened."
2336,4853-29413-0011.flac," the magistrate would put questions to me, wouldn't he, sir? very good. you put questions to me, and i'll answer them to the best of my ability."
2337,4853-29413-0004.flac," with the face ominously wretched as with face ominously wretched as with face ominously wretched as well as ugly. i instantly thought of crystal. if you bring me bad news, i said, don't keep me waiting with waiting for it. it's nothing that need trouble you, sir."
2338,4853-29413-0012.flac," the investigation that followed was far too long and too weary some to be related here. if i give the substance of it, i shall have done enough. sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone, sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming."
2339,4853-29413-0010.flac," we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law and force, i said. in the meantime, gludy, i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness."" he considered a little."
2340,4853-29413-0016.flac," gludy was employed as, employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful. he had no reason to suppose that i was the ob- was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party."
2341,4853-29413-0006.flac," what did he do? flew into a furious rage. i don't complain of that. i dare say i deserved it. please, too, excuse my getting up again. i can't look you in the face and tell you of it. he walked away to the window."
2342,4853-29413-0001.flac," the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me. the mercy of sleep found me. when i woke and looked at my watch, i was a new man. the hour was noon. i rang my bell."
2343,4853-29413-0002.flac," the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me. the same man, sir. the same man, sir, who was found in the garden, looking at your flowers. i, at once, gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom."
2344,4853-27670-0015.flac," her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg. at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water, creaming upon the surges on either hand,"
2345,4853-27670-0028.flac," for they lay under a whole body of shrouds, complicated by a massive other year, against which leaned a portion of the caboose. i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead, and then, with a heart of lead, turned away."
2346,4853-27670-0000.flac," i lay for a long while insensible, and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon, i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvelous."
2347,4853-27670-0035.flac," i had noticed the jolly boat, jolly boat, bottom up near the starboard gangway, and so far as i could make a... ...by throwing the dull lantern light upon her, she was sound. but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing."
2348,4853-27670-0023.flac," but i now notice that the weight of the hamper being on the lardboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast, ballast, ballast, and that she floated on a level keel with her bow's fair at the sea."
2349,4853-27670-0030.flac, no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead. the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea.
2350,4853-27670-0036.flac," and even had i managed this, she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned."
2351,4853-27670-0024.flac," i moved with extreme caution, casting the lantern light before me, sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan, then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull."
2352,4853-27670-0019.flac," i swallowed a half-a-panicon of the hollens for the sake of the warmth and life of the draft, and entering my cabin, put on thick, dry stockings, first, chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them."
2353,4853-27670-0025.flac," until, coming in the breast of the main hatch, the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body, which, on my bringing the flame to his face, proved to be captain rosie. be captain rosie. be captain rosie. there was a wound over his right brow."
2354,4853-27670-0026.flac," and as if that had not suffice to slay him, the fall of the mast had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round and on and on his body, binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly."
2355,4853-27670-0027.flac," that no executioner could have gone more than one more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man. under a massive rigging that rigging in the lardboard scuppers lay two bodies, as i could just faintly discern."
2356,4853-27670-0034.flac," to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel. that she was filling i knew well, not leaking so rapidly, but that had our crew being preserved. we might easily have kept her free."
2357,4853-27670-0005.flac," the brig pitched enrolled heavily. much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her, her. nevertheless, i could not persuade myself to self-dress off that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in."
2358,4853-27670-0014.flac," reasserted itself. and maybe i also got some slender comfort, some slender comfort, some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the, real heavy as was the motion of the brig. there was yet the buoyancy of vitality, the buoyancy of vitality in our manner of mounting the seas. and that, after all,"
2359,4853-27670-0029.flac, i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seamant. the seamant named abraham wise near the forehatch.
2360,4853-27670-0016.flac," by preventing the seas, which washed onto the forecast, by forecast, by forecastle, from cascading with their former violence aft. also, that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side."
2361,4853-27670-0021.flac," i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me, enveloping my head, which i had cased in a warm, cased in a warm, cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it. m thus equipped, i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log."
2362,4853-27670-0004.flac," there was less spied in its wash, less fury in its blow. the multitude in us roaring of the heaving blackness had soared into a heart and sullen growling, a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley."
2363,4853-27670-0018.flac," i took down the lamp, trimmed it, and went to the lazarus hatch at the after end of the cabin. here, we're kept the stores for the crew."
2364,4853-27670-0013.flac," misery and horror were within that shadow, and beyond it, nothing that my spirit could look up to. i stood for some moments as one stunned, and then my manhood, trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea,"
2365,4853-27670-0011.flac," but no feature of my lamentable situation so afraid of me, so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness. o for one companion!"
2366,4853-27670-0031.flac," but the motion of the brig continued very heavy, a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone. and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses,"
2367,4853-27670-0002.flac," my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armor, so inflexibly hard were they frozen. yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk, and that life flowed warm in my veins."
2368,4853-27670-0010.flac," it was dreadful, i say, to be thus placed, and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest, most desolate space of sea in the world, into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round."
2369,4853-27670-0012.flac," even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech. nay, god himself, the merciful father of all, even he seemed not. yet the blackness laid like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul."
2370,4853-27670-0020.flac," and i then, with the siemens dispatch, shifted the rest of my apparel, and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change. though the jacket and trousers i put on were still down with the soaking of previous days."
2371,4853-27670-0003.flac," it was intensely dark. the binocle lamp was extinguished, and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest color upon the hatchway. one thing i quickly noticed, that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze."
2372,4853-27670-0017.flac, my eyes directly saw it and found the time 20 minutes after 10. this signified that i had 10 or 11 hours of darkness before me.
2373,4853-27670-0009.flac, my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation. it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness.
2374,4853-27670-0006.flac," it was wonderful, however, that she should still be afloat. no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out."
2375,4853-27670-0032.flac," i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull, with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside. wait here enough, you would have supposed to stave the ship."
2376,4853-27670-0008.flac," what has come to pass? is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard? certainly, five men at least were living before we followed the ice. and again, i cried out. is there anyone alive?"
2377,4853-27670-0033.flac," nevertheless, her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that, spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state, being as hopeless as the sky was starless."
2378,4853-27670-0022.flac," nevertheless, it's—never the less—it's raised, suffered me to guess at the picture of ruehm, the deck's offered. the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck. and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth."
2379,4853-27670-0007.flac," finding that i had the use of my voice, i hello this loudly as i could, but no human note responded. three or four times i shouted, giving some of the people their names, but in vain. father of mercy i thought."
2380,4853-27670-0001.flac," i had no sooner side up than all that had happened, and my present situation instantly came to me. my hair was stiff with ice. there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone."
2381,4853-27671-0017.flac," shot with pearly luster, floated overhead very high. it was very high. it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed, but the air being dry, its shy, its shy, its shrewdness was indurable."
2382,4853-27671-0011.flac," eight or ten biscuits, some candles, a tinderbox, several lemons, a little bag of flour, and thirteen bottles of beer. these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat."
2383,4853-27671-0006.flac," and there lay the longboat crushed into staves. the signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness, though my spirit sank again at the sight of my poor, drowned shipmates."
2384,4853-27671-0008.flac," when she should be launched and lying alongside. ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash, shipping scarce a hat full of water."
2385,4853-27671-0024.flac," so that when he jumped to the surface, he came with his hands lifted up to heaven, and thus he stayed a minute, sustained by the eddies which also revolved him. the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great,"
2386,4853-27671-0027.flac, the boat was about 15 feet long.
2387,4853-27671-0016.flac," till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle. upon the eastern sea line, layer range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover."
2388,4853-27671-0039.flac," it was as silent as a phantom, and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable. so far from finding any comfort or companionship in the creature,"
2389,4853-27671-0013.flac," it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her, and if this well fell over her bows and filled the decks, down she would go. i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest, and was about to fetch this money."
2390,4853-27671-0032.flac," i am persuaded my heart, i am persuaded my heart must have broken, and that i should have died of grief. faintly is the grief. faintly is the grief. faintly is the wind blue. it speedily wafed me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck."
2391,4853-27671-0001.flac," i had at one time during the block hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float, brig would float, brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise."
2392,4853-27671-0030.flac," i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up. and that, though by, i, though by, i, though by heading east, i should be clinging to the stormy parts. i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts."
2393,4853-27671-0020.flac," into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky. will the whole floated? she was something to hold on to, so to say, something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon."
2394,4853-27671-0031.flac, then by sailing into the great desolation of the northwest. the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering.
2395,4853-27671-0040.flac," it uttered a strange salt cry, the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon her, and splitting upon her rope, flopped its wings, and after a turn or two."
2396,4853-27671-0005.flac," had floated the jolly boat out of the longboat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay. as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use. for not long after, it had been floated out, the brig struck the burg, the mast fell,"
2397,4853-27671-0035.flac," lifting my eyes within voluntary sympathy, in the blip blip in voluntary sympathy, in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor, blip blip sailor, blip sailor, i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies."
2398,4853-27671-0034.flac," but one living thing there was besides myself, a grey-brusted albatross of a princely width opinion. i had not observed it till the whole went down, and then,"
2399,4853-27671-0010.flac," i ran to the cabin, but the lazarette was full of water, and none of the provisions in it to become at. i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese, a piece of raw pork, half a ham, and a piece of meat."
2400,4853-27671-0036.flac," it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions, and poised on tremorless wings."
2401,4853-27671-0007.flac," and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat and boat boat boat over. i then, with a hand spike, prized her nose to the gangway, secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers."
2402,4853-27671-0037.flac," was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion, the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise."
2403,4853-27671-0026.flac," and hauling the sheet afed, put the ore over the stern, and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course. the draft of air was extremely weak, and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside."
2404,4853-27671-0018.flac," with us had it dawned on yesterday instead of today. my companions would have been alive, and yonder sinking ruined fabric, a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly in two warm seas and two our homes at last."
2405,4853-27671-0002.flac," and a deep of rolling sapphire, i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water, and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the ballwork rail."
2406,4853-27671-0009.flac," but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat, and this, with the mast and sail, i dropped into her. the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past. my next business was to victual her."
2407,4853-27671-0014.flac," when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hall gave me a fright. and, watching my chance, i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her a draft. the sun was an hour above the horizon."
2408,4853-27671-0023.flac," it was the sailor that had lained round on the starboard side of the forward deck. being... being frozen stiff, he rose in the posture in which he had expired. that is, with his arms extended."
2409,4853-27671-0028.flac," air i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view. at the start i had a mind to steer northwest, at a steer northwest and blow, as the wind would suffer, into the south sea."
2410,4853-27671-0012.flac, the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to be to make haste. she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue brows to her stem.
2411,4853-27671-0015.flac," heaving very slowly, though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold. and eastwards, the shoulder of the swell, catching the glorious reflection of the sun, hurled the splendour along."
2412,4853-27671-0021.flac, and her main deck blew up with a loud clapper blast of noise. i could follow the line of her bowlworks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under.
2413,4853-27671-0025.flac," and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition, had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason. i rose from the seat onto which i had sunk and lose the sail."
2414,4853-27671-0019.flac, i threw the- i threw the ore over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig. not so much because i desired to see the last of her.
2415,4853-27671-0033.flac," and then all was bare, bald, swelling sea, an imperiled sky, darkening in lagoon of azure, down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapor, lying like the coast of a continent on the lardboard horizon."
2416,4853-27671-0003.flac," yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin. it was visible now to its most trifling detail. the foremask was gone smooth off the deck, it lay over the starboard bow."
2417,4853-27671-0029.flac," where perchants i might not wear perchants i might not wear perchants i might meet a wailer or a south seaman from new holland. but my heart sank at the where prospect of the leagues of water, where which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard. indeed,"
2418,4853-27671-0004.flac," one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected. the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat. stowed in the long boat. stowed in the long boat. it was thus we carried those boats, the little one lying snuggly, one lying snuggly enough in the other. the sea that had flooded our decks,"
2419,4853-27671-0022.flac," and which she dragged down with her and her. on a sudden, when the last fragment of mast had disappeared, and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea, uproze a body with a sort of leap."
2420,4853-27671-0038.flac, the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me. its eyes had the sparkling blood-red gleam of rubies.
2421,4853-27671-0000.flac," there were a few stars dying out in the dark west. the atmosphere was clear, and when the sun rose, i knew he would turn the sable-pull overhead into blueness. the hull lay very deep."
2422,4830-25904-0021.flac," one little leopard was better bred than the others, for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner, which was an example to the rest. the mayans ate and dignified silence."
2423,4830-25904-0040.flac," and then nodded his rough, grache body into a great loop with the fiery-eyed head in the middle. he was not one of the largest kind, but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits."
2424,4830-25904-0048.flac," its eyes were lovely, so dark and soft and liquid. but its mouth was not pretty, and i declined one of the damp kisses, which it was ready to dispense at word of command."
2425,4830-25904-0017.flac, for they tumbled one over the other. shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders.
2426,4830-25904-0036.flac," out, i said to myself, thinking of a story i read once of a person in a managerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding toward him."
2427,4830-25904-0028.flac, nut shells and straw down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails. one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail. i'm afraid the grey one bit it off.
2428,4830-25904-0041.flac, which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive. i was walking toward the camel's pogoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face. it's the boa i thought.
2429,4830-25904-0032.flac, and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away. the snake house came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family. i rather like snakes
2430,4830-25904-0033.flac," since i had a tame green one who lived under the doorstep, it would come out and play with me on sunny days. these snakes i found very interesting. only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out, and it wasn't allowed to poke them."
2431,4830-25904-0050.flac," he looked very unhappy, and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him. these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw."
2432,4830-25904-0022.flac," all but my favorite, who carried his share to his sick mate, and by every gentle means in his power tried to make all power, tried to make power, tried to make her eat. she was too ill, however, and turned her way with a plant of moan, which seemed to grieve him sadly."
2433,4830-25904-0023.flac," he wouldn't touch his dinner, but lay down near her with the lump between his paws, as if guarding it fit fit fit for her. and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his tongue, tongue, tongue, till his mate could share it with him."
2434,4830-25904-0030.flac," bounce on to the straw. at first he'd sit and stare about him as if much amazes to find himself there. then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently, which seemed to delight the other monkeys."
2435,4830-25904-0020.flac, the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up. in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more.
2436,4830-25904-0046.flac," and in an immense wire-covered aviary, all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as galley as if at home. one of the curiosity was a seakow who lived in a tank of saltwater."
2437,4830-25904-0035.flac," best. when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree, such as i had seen in other cages, for the snakes to wind up and down. where is he i wondered? i hope he hasn't got..."
2438,4830-25904-0025.flac," as a contrast to the wild beasts, i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine, large house all to themselves. here was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows"
2439,4830-25904-0018.flac," one lady had a fright. for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw, and he clutched it, trying to drag her to drag her to drag her niver. the shawl came off, and the poor lady ran away screaming."
2440,4830-25904-0044.flac," hoping to find something, hoping to find something, to find something eatable. i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as a hope tree, as a tree, as i looked about me, and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees. flux of snow-white cranes stalking over the grass,"
2441,4830-25904-0016.flac," gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles. the lions behaved best, where they only paced up and down with an occasional cry, but the tigers were quite frantic."
2442,4830-25904-0042.flac," much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me. he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way, which i certainly had done with all speed, picking myself out of the hedge."
2443,4830-25904-0019.flac, as if the whole family of wild beasts were after her.
2444,4830-25904-0038.flac," and lay so still, i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me. a very villainous-looking reptile he was, and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country"
2445,4830-25904-0037.flac," as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me, the branch began to move all at once, and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the bow's glittering eyes."
2446,4830-25904-0034.flac," and blinked at me through the glass, the glass, looking quite as dangerous as he was. there were big and little snakes, and big and little snakes, black, brown and speckled, lively and lazy, pretty and plain ones, but i like the great boa."
2447,4830-25904-0049.flac," the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water were sitting on a block of ice, panting, as if the mile spring day was blazing mid-summer."
2448,4830-25904-0047.flac," and came at the keepers call to kiss him, and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish. it was very like a seal, only much larger, and had four fins instead of two."
2449,4830-25904-0039.flac, where such unpleasant neighbors might pop in upon you unexpectedly. he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself.
2450,4830-25904-0027.flac," he was a cross-old party and sat hollowed up in the straw, scowling at everyone like an ill-tempered old bachelor. kaffa doesn't little ones. teased him capuchally by dropping bits of bread."
2451,4830-25904-0026.flac, who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers. a mama sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the grey monkey with the blue nose scolded at me.
2452,4830-25904-0029.flac," and kept trying to swing like the others, forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with. he would run up the bear bows and give a jump, expecting to catch and swing, but the lame tail wouldn't hold him, and down he'd go."
2453,4830-25904-0031.flac," and finally, he did, finally, he did, finally, he did examine his poor little tale and appear to understand the misfortune which had been fallen him. and fallen him. the fallen him. the funny expression of his face was irresistible, and i enjoyed seeing him very much."
2454,4830-25904-0024.flac," as i took a last look at his final face, i named him douglas and walked away, humming to myself the lines of the ballad. douglas douglas, tender and true."
2455,4830-25904-0045.flac, on their long scarlet legs. striped zebras racing racing racing in their in their in their paddock. queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches. pretty antelopes the antelopes chasing one another.
2456,4830-25904-0043.flac," i walked beside him, examining his clumsy feet, and peering up at his small, intelligent eye. i'm very sure he winked at me, as if enjoying the joke, and kept poking his trunk into my pocket."
2457,4830-25904-0003.flac," and i was so glad to meet with anyone from home that i'd have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me. he didn't, however."
2458,4830-25904-0014.flac," and all to get very much excited about something, sniffing at the openings, thrusting their paws through the bars, and lashing their tails impatiently. i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till"
2459,4830-25904-0011.flac," some leaping up and down, and some washing their faces, sacking their faces, and sacking their faces with their velvet paws. all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head."
2460,4830-25904-0012.flac," it was a very loud and large purr, but no fireside pussy could have done it better, and everyone laughed at the sound. there were pretty spotted leopards, panthers, and smaller varieties of the same species."
2461,4830-25904-0010.flac," i liked this line very much, for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face. the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are, some creeping noiselessly to and fro."
2462,4830-25904-0005.flac," so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelicans. i never knew before what handsome birds they were, not graceful, but with such snowy plumage tinned with pale pink and faint yellow."
2463,4830-25904-0000.flac," being alone in london, yet wishing to celebrate the day, i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoo-logical gardens. in lovely place it was, and i enjoyed myself immensely. for mayday in england is just what it should be."
2464,4830-25904-0006.flac, they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills.
2465,4830-25904-0001.flac," mild, sunny, flowery, and spring-like. like, like. as i walked along the well-kept paths between white and rosy hothorn hedges, i kept coming upon new and curious sights."
2466,4830-25904-0007.flac," when fed, they gobbled up the fish, never stopping to swallow it until the pouches under their bills were full. then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen."
2467,4830-25904-0004.flac," and put down his immense head with a sullen snort, as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction. i did not blame him for the poor fellow who was homesick, doubtless, for his own wide prairies, and the free life he had lost."
2468,4830-25904-0002.flac, for the birds and beasts are so skillfully arranged that it is more like traveling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a managerie. the first thing i saw was a great american bison.
2469,4830-25904-0013.flac," i sat watching them a long time, longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run. they seemed so unhappy, they seemed so unhappy, barred in those small dens. suddenly the small dens. suddenly the lions began to roar, the tigers to snarl."
2470,4830-25904-0009.flac," one lioness was ill, and lay on her bed, looking very pensive, while her mate moved restlessly about her. evidently anxious to do something for her, and much afflicted by her suffering."
2471,4830-25904-0015.flac," this was their dinner, and as they were fed, but once a day they were ravenous. such roars and howls and cries as a rose while the man went slowly down the line."
2472,4830-25904-0008.flac," and there found a splendid sight. six lions and lions and lionesses in three or four different cages, sitting or standing and standing and dignified attitudes, and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes."
2473,4830-25898-0033.flac, and was innocently catching gnats when her mama came out of the hamo with a loud cut cut cut
2474,4830-25898-0001.flac, and no sooner were they out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as galley as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their special benefit. it was a fine brood.
2475,4830-25898-0046.flac," in the morning, few morning, few morning, few remained, and blot felt that she was a fore-learned orphan, a thought which caused, thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours, brooding over her sad lot."
2476,4830-25898-0043.flac," and were seen by their surviving relatives, featherliss, and by their surviving relatives featherliss, pale, and stiff, born away to some unknown place, when snowfowl returned. blot was waked one night by a great cackling, fluttering in the henhouse,"
2477,4830-25898-0036.flac," who just then waddled by, oh, what can i do scream the distressed hymn? nothing ma'am, it's fatal. and the doctor waddled on to visit dame parklet's son, who was ill of the pip. my child, my child,"
2478,4830-25898-0004.flac," before he had a feather to his bit of a tail, chanty began to fight, and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farm yard. having pecked his brothers and sisters, he tried to do the same to his playmates."
2479,4830-25898-0021.flac," and here if i can't do it as well as daddy. the chick stops scratching and scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear struck crow. purchasing himself on the beam, he tried his best"
2480,4830-25898-0019.flac, so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up. then how he did struck and rustle his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him.
2481,4830-25898-0053.flac, and colder and colder became poor blots and blots little feet as she waited through the drifts. the fire light was shining out into the gloom.
2482,4830-25898-0044.flac," and peeping down from her perch, saw a great hand glide along the roost, clutch her beloved mother by the leg, and pulled her off, screaming dofully."
2483,4830-25898-0034.flac, where is pete?
2484,4830-25898-0026.flac," eating everything she could find, and often making herself ill by gobbling too fast and forgetting to eat a little gravel to help digest her food. don't go out of the barn children, i'm going to lay an egg."
2485,4830-25898-0008.flac," sitting side by side, the plump sisters were placidly swaying, placidly swaying up and down over the clear brown water, water rippling below when said to relate. the stem broke and down went leaf."
2486,4830-25898-0017.flac," he was added from morning till night, and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill, small boys make funny attempts to produce horse little crows, as he sat on the wall and stretched his yaluneck."
2487,4830-25898-0042.flac," they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farm yard. for turkeys, hens, ducks and geese fell a prey to it."
2488,4830-25898-0009.flac, chickens and all to a chin all to a watery death. i'm the most unlucky hand ever hatched grown
2489,4830-25898-0054.flac," to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her, but the bow of a leafless tree. two stiff and weak to fly up, she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the doorstep."
2490,4830-25898-0028.flac, peep found a little hole into the meal room and slipped in full of joy at the site of the bags boxes and bins. i'll eat all i want and then i'll call peck she said.
2491,4830-25898-0040.flac," had loved her as much as she did the others, who were all white, gray, or yellow. poor little blot had been much neglected by everyone, but now her lonely mama discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was."
2492,4830-25898-0023.flac," for poor strut. he leaned so far forward in a sprantic effort to get a big crawl out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor, killing himself instantly."
2493,4830-25898-0035.flac," there, peck stopped suddenly, rolled up her eyes and began to stagger about as if she was tipsy. mercy on us! what's the matter with the chick? cried mrs. clark in grade alarm. fits, ma'am, answer dr. drake."
2494,4830-25898-0013.flac," the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up, give one, one lower croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs, faster legs, faster legs and wings could carry her. little speckle, remembering the advice,"
2495,4830-25898-0048.flac, lots saw a little kitten muing pitifully as a kitten muing pitifully as a kitten muing pitifully as it sat under the fence. what is the matter dear? the matter dear asked kind lot.
2496,4830-25898-0037.flac," don't flap and stagger, don't stir so. let me hold you. taste this mint leaf. have a drop of water. what shall i do?"" as poor mrs. clark sighed and sobbed, her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back."
2497,4830-25898-0015.flac," what shall i do?"" it was a dreadful blow to mrs. clark. an ant cockle-top didn't show herself for a whole day after that story was known."
2498,4830-25898-0055.flac," and with a shiver put her little head under her wing, trying to forget hunger, weariness and the bitter cold, and wait patiently for morning. but when morning came, little came, little blot lay frozen stiff under a couplet of snow."
2499,4830-25898-0006.flac, chanty thought he could beat mr. bantam easily. he was so small and invited him to fight. mr. b declined. then chanty called him a coward and gave mrs. b a peck.
2500,4830-25898-0047.flac," and longing to join her family, family in some safe and happy land, where fowls lived in peace. she had her wish very soon. for one day, when the first snowflakes began to flutter,"
2501,4830-25898-0031.flac," with their poor little claws sticking straight up up as if imploning help. peck, meanwhile, got into mischief also."
2502,4830-25898-0016.flac," for every file in the yard, tweeted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice."
2503,4830-25898-0025.flac," being very fond of one another. peep was a most inquisitive chicken, poking her head into every nook and corner and never satisfied till she had seen all there was to see. peck was a glutton."
2504,4830-25898-0014.flac," unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away, chirping dismaly."
2505,4830-25898-0049.flac," i live at the red farmhouse over the hill, only i don't know which road to take. i'll show you. come at once. for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for us, said blood. so a way they went."
2506,4830-25898-0011.flac," what a nice time speckled time speckled time speckled did have to be sure. for the grasshoppers, grasshoppers were lively and fat and ant was in an unusually amiable mood. never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it."
2507,4830-25898-0018.flac," till his throat quite ached with the effort. ah, if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn, and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear, i should be perfectly happy,"" said the silly little foul."
2508,4830-25898-0002.flac," but poor madame clark had bad luck with her chicks, but they were her first, and she didn't know how to manage them. old anne cockled's hop told her that she didn't, and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends."
2509,4830-25898-0010.flac, and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with and cockle top grass-hoppering they called it in the great field across the road.
2510,4830-25898-0000.flac," there never was a prouder mama than madame clark when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks. chicks. chant a clear, struck, snowball, speck, peep, peck, downy, and blot with their names."
2511,4830-25898-0024.flac," for some time after this mrs. clark kept her three remaining little ones close to her side, watching over them with maternal care till they were hardly tired of her anxious clockings. peep and peck were always together,"
2512,4830-25898-0052.flac," so goodbye dear, oh goodbye dear, an off-charted blot long this snowy road, hoping to get home before the hen house door was shut. faster and faster fell the snow, darker and darker grew the night."
2513,4830-25898-0003.flac," and cockletop was right, as you will see, when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family. the tragedy began with chanty, who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow."
2514,4830-25898-0041.flac," for blot was a great comfort to her. never running away or disobeying in any way, but always close to her side, ready to creep under her wing, or bring her a plump bug when the poor bitties appetite failed her."
2515,4830-25898-0027.flac," and can't look after you just now said their mother one day. yes ma'am chirp chirp the chickens. and then as she went rustling into the haymo, they began to run about and enjoy themselves with all their might."
2516,4830-25898-0038.flac," gasping and rolling up her eyes in great anguish, for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt, and there was no help for her. when always over, they buried the dead chicken under a current bush, covered the little grave with chickweed,"
2517,4830-25898-0012.flac," like a brave chick said the old bitty, as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind. speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp, which caused anne to utter that remark."
2518,4830-25898-0030.flac," sam never saw her, but shut down, down, down, the cover of the bin as he passed, and left poor peep to die. no one knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal."
2519,4830-25898-0039.flac," and the bereaved parent wore a black string around her leg for a month. blot, the last of that bright band, needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow. this was the reason why her mother never"
2520,4830-25898-0007.flac, which ended in chanty's utter defeat for he died from his wounds. down in snowballs soon followed. for the two sweet little things would swing on the burdock leaves that grew over the brook.
2521,4830-25898-0020.flac," you'll fall and get hurt,"" said his sister-blot. hold your tongue, you ugly little thing, and don't talk to me. i'm going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen. be quiet down there."
2522,4830-25898-0005.flac," the ducklings, gosslings, and young turkeys, and was so disagreeable that all the fouls hated him. one day a pair of vantoms arrived, pretty little white birds with red crests and nice yellow feet."
2523,4830-25898-0050.flac, but it was a long way and dust came on before the red farmhouse appeared. now i'm safe. thank you very much. won't you come in and stay all night? my mother will be glad to see you.
2524,4830-25898-0051.flac," send the kit, rubbing her soft white face against plots, against plots, against plots, little black breast."
2525,4830-25898-0032.flac," she strayed into the sheep shed and finding some salt, ate as much as she liked, not knowing that salt is bad for hands. having taken all she wanted, she ran back to the barn"
2526,4830-25898-0045.flac," and cockled up pet and croaked fiercely, but top of she was, the old bitty did not escape ape, ape, ape, and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand."
2527,4830-25898-0022.flac," came of it, and all the chicks laughed. that made strut mad, and he resolved to crow, even if king crow, even if crow, even if he killed himself doing it. he gave an angry clock, slapped his wings, and tried again. alas, alas!"
2528,4830-25898-0029.flac, and having taken the taste of everything she was about to leave when she heard the stable men coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the meal bin and hid herself.
2529,4788-94904-0018.flac," and the only fruit produced by national representation is that in addition to those who really govern, there is an assembly quartered on the public, and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are interested is at all likely to be removed."
2530,4788-94904-0019.flac," when, however, the evil stops here, the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which, though not an invariable, are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation."
2531,4788-94904-0025.flac," to the acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an impediment. the most obvious of these cases is the one already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization, that of obedience."
2532,4788-94904-0016.flac," or of someone with whom they are connected as adherents or adherents or dependence. the small class who in this state of public feeling gain the command of the representative body for the most part use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune. if the executive is weak,"
2533,4788-94904-0026.flac," a race who had been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors, but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior, would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body."
2534,4788-94904-0022.flac," they would certainly, as in spanish america, keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war. a despotism, not even legal, but a bill legal violence, would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers."
2535,4788-94904-0023.flac," and the name and forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from attaining, meaning, meaning, the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized."
2536,4788-94904-0037.flac," under his protection numerous communities, under his protection numerous communities, for his protection numerous communities were formed which knew no one above them but the king."
2537,4788-94904-0029.flac," but as it is merely personal, it rarely affects any change in the general habits of the people. unless the prophet, like muhammad, is also a military chief and goes forth the armed apostle of a new religion."
2538,4788-94904-0013.flac," they seldom obtain affording at all, and if they do, are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government, or any party leader who can muster force for a coup de main, is willing to run some small risk for absolute power."
2539,4788-94904-0034.flac," he was the object of hope when reliance throughout the kingdom, while each local potentate was only powerful within a more or less confined space. at his hands, refuge and protection were sought from every part of the country against first one."
2540,4788-94904-0014.flac, these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government. the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution.
2541,4788-94904-0032.flac," might be expected to lighten it. on the contrary, many of people has gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central authority, whose majority, whose authority, whose position has made it the rival and is ended by making it the master of the local despots."
2542,4788-94904-0012.flac," and is sure to be well-supported in doing so. representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of their being endangered. if too little valued for this,"
2543,4788-94904-0033.flac," even when the king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief futitories, the great advantage which he derived from being but one has been recognized by french historians. to him the eyes of all the locally oppressed were turned."
2544,4788-94904-0015.flac," when nobody, or only some small fraction, feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion, the electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage, but to serve their private interest, or the interest of their locality."
2545,4788-94904-0039.flac," though generally much restricted in practice, was mainly instrumental in carrying the people through a necessary stage of improvement. representative government, if real, would most likely have prevented them from entering upon."
2546,4788-94904-0030.flac," or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government. a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified, by extreme passiveness"
2547,4788-94904-0011.flac," unless, therefore, the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country, the executive is always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience."
2548,4788-94904-0038.flac," and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally, rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation. in this manner a central power, despotic in principle,"
2549,4788-94904-0036.flac, it abated in the oppressed portion of the community the habit of submitting to oppression. the kings' interest lay in encouraging all partial attempts on the part of the serfs to emancipate themselves from their rastres and place themselves in immediate subordination to himself.
2550,4788-94904-0027.flac, a representative assembly drawn from among themselves would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination. it would insubordination. it would insubordination. it would refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose on their savage independence any improving restraint.

2552,4788-94904-0020.flac," that the place hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly, though they contribute little or nothing directly to good government, nor even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive."
2553,4788-94904-0017.flac," the country is distracted by mere struggles for place. they were place. if strong, it makes itself despotic. at the cheap price of appeasingly representatives, or such of them as are capable of giving trouble, by a share of the spoil."
2554,4788-94904-0021.flac," which exists in that country. this benefit, however, is entirely dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary king. if instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler, these selfish and sorted factions struggled for the chief place itself."
2555,4788-94904-0024.flac," there are others in which it possibly might exist, but in which some other form of government would be preferable. these are principally when the people, in order to advance in civilization, have some advance in civilization, have some lesson to learn, some habit not yet acquired."

2557,4788-94904-0028.flac," a military leader is the only superior to whom they will submit, except occasionally some profit supposed to be inspired from above, or conjurer, regarded as possessing miraculous power. these may exercise a temporary ascendancy."
2558,4788-94904-0003.flac," that they should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the functions, the functions which it imposes on them. the willingness of the people to accept a representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler, or a foreign nation, or nations,"
2559,4788-94904-0009.flac," in a state previously passive. when a people have no sufficient value for, and attachment to, a representative constitution, they have next to no chance of retaining it."
2560,4788-94904-0002.flac," as upon the degree in which they possess certain special requisites. requisites, however, so closely connected with their degree of general advancement, that any variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule."
2561,4788-94904-0008.flac," rather than positive opposition, are the obstacles to be expected. these, however, are as fatal and may be as hard to be- were be got rid of as actual aversion. it being easier aversion. it being easier, in most cases, to change the direction of an active feeling than to create one"
2562,4788-94904-0007.flac," whether monarchical or popular. in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made, in difference to it,"
2563,4788-94904-0001.flac," that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them, though this is not true universally. for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity,"
2564,4788-94904-0004.flac," who have gained power over the country, are disposed to offer it the boon. to end, when, when, when, when individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant, since, if norther objection can be made to their enterprise, then that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side,"
2565,4788-94904-0006.flac," the contrary case is not indeed an example. there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers, but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be."
2566,4788-94904-0005.flac," they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end-the-aim at. when opinion is really adverse, its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to represent it in itself."
2567,4788-94904-0000.flac," we have recognized and we have recognized and we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of men, portion of men kind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement. as they range lower and lower in development,"
2568,4788-94904-0010.flac," and is in direct contact with the public. to it, principally, the hopes and fears of individuals are directed, and by it, both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye."
2569,4788-91208-0026.flac," as mr. mills says, the name of god is veiled under two extremely abstract phrases, the infinite and the absolute. so profound and friendly are thinker as the late mr. grote held this raising of the veil in expedient, but he proved"
2570,4788-91208-0027.flac," by a mistake he fell into, then this necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete. he acknowledged the force of mr. mills' argument that the infinite must include a foraggo of contradictions."
2571,4788-91208-0032.flac," and we join with him in condemning, in mean as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to and devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange an eternity of personal enjoyment."
2572,4788-91208-0006.flac," of the mass of original thought that still remains to mr. mills' credit. the great critical power that could gather valuable truth from so many discordant sources, and the wonderful synthetic ability required to weld these and his own contributions"
2573,4788-91208-0034.flac," and all his relations to his fellow creatures, the very birds about his dwelling seemed to recognize it. it is this noble sentiment which infuses a soul of life into his teachings, and the enunciation and acting out of which constitute him."
2574,4788-91208-0018.flac, all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive. inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic. and to induction accordingly mr. mill devoted his chief attention. all chief attention. for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic.
2575,4788-91208-0033.flac," never has the libel of humanity involved in the current theology been more forcibly pointed out, with its constant appeal to low motives of personal gain and gain."
2576,4788-91208-0002.flac," the great intellectual points of our age, the man who has done more than any other of this generation to give direction to the thought of his contemporaries, has passed away, and we are left to measure the loss to humanity by the result of his labors."
2577,4788-91208-0010.flac," incapable of being proved from other propositions. it followed that if they were known to us at all, they must be original data of consciousness. here was a perfect paradise of question begging. the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed"
2578,4788-91208-0000.flac," it looks big and important, and it makes a great noise. even people a long way up in the scale of civilization are in the habit of taking these attributes, perhaps not as the essential ones of leadership, but at all events as those by which a leader may be recognized."
2579,4788-91208-0028.flac," in which these contradictory attributes in here. but it was against a corresponding being, the infinite, that mr. mill was arguing, arguing, arguing. it is this that he calls a"
2580,4788-91208-0019.flac," and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin. it was this, taken with his theory of the syllogism, which worked the great change. both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy"

2583,4788-91208-0013.flac," was but imperfectly, imperfectly, imperfectly realized, and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of. mr. mill altered all this. he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars, nor from particulars to generals, but from particulars to particulars."
2584,4788-91208-0022.flac," the biggest line in the path was the doctrine of so-called necessary truth. this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him. as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth and a standard of truth and a standard of truth and a standard as he was easily able to show,"
2585,4788-91208-0005.flac, that he borrowed from who well much of his classification from brown the chief the chief the chief lines of his theory of causation from sir john hershel the main principles of the inductive methods those who think this i think this a disparagement of his work must have very little conception

2587,4788-91208-0025.flac," in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy, mr. mel gives battle to this mode of thought. after reviewing, in an opening chapter, the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge,"
2588,4788-91208-0003.flac," mr. mills' achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either. whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society, he is..."
2589,4788-91208-0012.flac," as the only basis of reasoning. it is true that outside of the logic of the schools, great advances had been made in the rules of scientific investigation. but these rules were not only imperfect in themselves, but their connection with the law of causation."
2590,4788-91208-0016.flac," we not only may, according to mr. mill, reason from some particular instances to others, but we frequently do so. as however, the instances which are sufficient to prove one fresh instance"
2591,4788-91208-0007.flac," into one organic, in a whole. when mr. mel commenced his labors, the only logic recognized was the syllogistic."
2592,4788-91208-0031.flac, this religion of the infidel cannot in honesty and conscience be called an intrinsically bad one. many indeed may be unable to believe that this object is capable of gathering around it feeling sufficiently strong.
2593,4788-91208-0014.flac," but our now dead, we are now dead, we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal. we might, but surely, without any logical inconsequence, have concluded at once from those instances that the duke of wellington is mortal."
2594,4788-91208-0023.flac, varying according to the psychological history of the individual. such thinkers as dr. huaywell and mr. herbert spencer had to be met in intellectual combat. dr. huaywell held not that the inconceivability

2597,4788-91208-0004.flac," the structure raised by adam smith, malthus, and ricardo, but raised it at least one story higher. his inestimable system of logic was a revolution. it hardly needs, of course, to be said, that he owed much to his predecessors."

2599,4788-91208-0011.flac," it could, of course, be fashioned according to the particular conclusion it was called into proof. thus an artificial ignorance, as lyre calls it, was produced, which had the effect of sanctifying prejudice by recognizing so-called necessities of thought."
2600,4788-91208-0009.flac, some general propositions to start with. and these general propositions being x
2601,4788-91208-0020.flac," are for the most part devoted to fortifying this position, and demolishing the beliefs inconsistent with it. as a systematic psychologist, mr. mel has not done so much as either professor bain or mr. herbert spencer."
2602,4788-91208-0021.flac," the perfection of his method, its application and the uprooting of prejudices which stood in its way, this was the task to which mr. mill applied himself, with an ability and success rarely matched and never surpassed."
2603,4788-91208-0017.flac," the work of deduction is the interpretation of these formulas, and therefore, strictly speaking, is not inferential at all. the real inference was accomplished when the universal proposition was arrived at."
2604,4788-294466-0024.flac, dick has been going to the arizona state university this winter to be near his mother. she's a widow and he's her only son. her husband was a doctor and they lived back in boston before he died. dutel! the old man wagged his head sympathetically.
2605,4788-294466-0029.flac," his brown feet raised so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square two-story to doby near the mountains, the mountains, the mountains, a manual was there to lead their horses around back. mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flower-edged walk."

2608,4788-294466-0031.flac," then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom, she asked eagerly. may i tell dad an adventure we've had? mrs. farley, middle-aged, kind-faced, to-faced. shook her head, smiling down at the girl. not tonight, please. won't tomorrow do?"
2609,4788-294466-0001.flac," we couldn't have imagined that gunshot and surely the horses heard it also. jerry smile was reassuring. it was the story that frightened you girls i reckon he said, glancing about and up and down the road as he spoke."

2611,4788-294466-0015.flac," dora nodded. so he said, then she hastened to add, oh, don't think i'm inferring the jerry told an untruth, but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glant's stop startled. dora belman, she said."
2612,4788-294466-0003.flac," hurry along home to your milking, jerry, and dick, don't you bother to come with us. now that you're working on the new com ranch, you ought to be there. it's only a few miles up over this sunshine he wrote to gleason. we aren't the least bit afraid to ride home alone. are we?"
2613,4788-294466-0022.flac," he said, miss farley, your nursewoman, came down to mail some letters of spell back. then before mary could reply, he continued in his shrill, wavering voice."
2614,4788-294466-0027.flac," some with broken windows and doors, others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls. the only sign of life was in three small adobies where poor mexican families lived. broken windows in two of the houses were stuffed with brags."
2615,4788-294466-0026.flac, you wait until dick has been on the desert long enough to get a coat of tan. he may surprise you.
2616,4788-294466-0004.flac," she smiled at her friend. mary not wishing to appear foolishly timid said, in his courageous voice, the voice that she could muster. of course we're not afraid. goodbye, boys. we'll see you tomorrow."
2617,4788-294466-0013.flac," it was very still, not a sound was to be heard, now and then a rabbit, but yet, yet, yet darted past silently. how peaceful this hour is on the desert, mary began glancing at her friend, if she was glancing at her friend, who was riding so close at her side."
2618,4788-294466-0019.flac," grey bearded, unkempt, but with kind grey eyes. deep, grassunk and under shaggy brows stood in the open door. he smiled out at them in a friendly way, then beckoned with a bony finger."
2619,4788-294466-0018.flac," in the long ago days when the town had been teaming with life, picturesque looking minors and ranchers had sat there, tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns. today the chairs were empty. an old man shriveled."
2620,4788-294466-0014.flac," noticing the door was deep in thought, she asked lightly. thought, she asked lightly. won't you say it out loud? why, of course, i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loans rock house. because he had to do the milking, mary replied simply."
2621,4788-294466-0005.flac," feeling assured that the girls were alright, the boys went at a gallop down the road and across the desert valley to the new comb ranch."
2622,4788-294466-0012.flac, far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border. the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters. the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them.
2623,4788-294466-0020.flac," i do believe mr. harvey has a letter for us, dora said. the old man had shuffled into the dark, dark well of his store. a moment later he reappeared with several letters and a newspaper. good!"
2624,4788-294466-0010.flac," and jerry's mother taught a little desert school over near the newcomme ranch. she didn't teach long, though. for that very first vacation, she married jerry's cowboy father. after that, mother and mrs. newcomme were good friends, naturally, being brides and neighbors."
2625,4788-294466-0006.flac," they're nice boys, aren't they, mary said. i've always wished i had a brother, and i do believe jerry is going to be just like one allowed dora replied. i have no notice that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought"

2627,4788-294466-0011.flac," when jerry and i, three and i were little, we were playmates. i spent days at the ranch sometimes. her sweet face was very sad as she ended with, until mother died when i was eight. then you came east to boarding school and became like a sister to me."
2628,4788-294466-0028.flac," a bright black-eyed mexican boy of about ten ran out to the road as the girls approached. disapproached. come on, emanuel. mary saying down to him, you may put up our horses and horses and horses and earn a dime. the small boy's white teeth flashed in a delighted grin."
2629,4788-294466-0000.flac," mary's nettlesome brown pony, pony, pony was hard to quiet until jerry reached out a strong brown hand and patted it at its head. mary lifted startled blue eyes. jerry, what do you make of that? she asked."
2630,4788-294466-0009.flac," when she spoke, she said, it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister. our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides. i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have. my mother met dad in bizby where he was a mining engineer."
2631,4788-294466-0007.flac," oh, mary, help, oh, how blind you are. dreamily, the younger girl was saying, that's because we were playmates, it's when we were little so very long ago. oh, my, how, oh, how ancient we are, dora said teasingly."
2632,4788-294466-0002.flac," he must have been dead for years if he was sold when jerry's father was a boy. of course, dora lesson climbed to be imagined and replied. then to the cowboy, she said in her practical matter of fact way,"
2633,4788-294466-0008.flac," please remember that you are only one year younger than i am, and i refuse to be called elderly. mary's smile, thankly, but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past, when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist. a wonderfully pretty, wistful little girl."
2634,4788-294466-0016.flac," i don't believe he will tell us about that. i acted so like a scarecat all the time we were there, he won't ever take us there again, and he probably won't tell us the story either. then i'll find it out some other way, dorrard declared."

2667,445-123857-0018.flac, what old december's bearness? what old december's bearness? what old december's bearness? everywhere. and yet this time removed was summers time. the teaming autumn big with rich increase. baring the wanton burden of the prime.
2668,445-123857-0021.flac," from you have i been absent in the spring. when proud pied april dressed in all his trim, hath put a spirit of youth in everything."
2669,445-123857-0028.flac," but for his theft in pride of all his growth, all his growth of vengeful canker ate him up to death."
2670,445-123857-0016.flac," take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege."
2671,445-123857-0022.flac," yet, nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell of different flowers in order and in you, could make me any summer's story tell, or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew."
2672,445-123857-0020.flac," and thou away the very birds are mute, or if they sing, is with so, with so, with so dollar cheer that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near."
2673,445-123857-0014.flac," that tongue that tells the story of idaise, making lascivious comments on nice sports, cannot disprase but in a kind of praise. naming, naming by name, blesses an ill report."
2674,445-123857-0015.flac," oh, what a mention have those vices got, which for their habitation chose out thee, where beauties veiled, thus cover every blot, and all for every blot, and all for every blot, and all things turns to fair that eyes can see."
2675,445-123857-0019.flac," like widowed wombs after lecture their lord's decease. yet this, like, like, yet, this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans and unfothered fruit, like unfothered fruit, unfothered fruit. for summer and his pleasures wait on thee,"
2676,445-123857-0025.flac," the forward violet thus did i chide. sweet, sted i chide. sweet, sted i chide. sweet, thief, whenst its thou steal thy sweet that smells, if not from my love's breath."
2677,445-123857-0031.flac," sing to the ear that duff i lay's esteem, and if i lay's esteem, and if i lay's esteem, and gives thy pen both skill and argument."
2678,445-123857-0027.flac," the roses, fearfully unthorns, did stand. one blushing shame, another white despair. a third, nor red, nor white, had stolen of both, and to his robbery had an extra thy breath."
2679,445-123857-0017.flac, some say that the grace is youth in gentle sport. both grace and faults are loved of more and less.
2680,445-123857-0032.flac," my love sweet face survey. if time have any wrinkle graven there. if there, if any, be a satire to decay."
2681,445-123857-0023.flac," nor did i wonder at the lilies white, these white, nor praised the deep vermillion in the deep vermillion in the rows. they were but sweet, but figures of the light drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
2682,445-123857-0029.flac," where art thou mues, that thou forget so long, so long to speak of that which gives the all i might? spence to thou thy fury on some worthless song,"
2683,445-123857-0009.flac, and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone.
2684,445-123857-0007.flac, what air thy thoughts or the hearts workings be?
2685,445-123857-0004.flac," happy to have, i love. happy to die."
2686,445-123857-0010.flac," they rightly do inherit heaven's graces, graces, graces, and husband's nature's riches from expense. they are the lords and owners of their faces, others but stewards of their excellence."
2687,445-123857-0005.flac," by looks with me, by heart, in other place. for there can live no hatred in thine eye. therefore in that i cannot know thy change."
2688,445-123857-0000.flac," some glory in their birth, some in their skill, some in their wealth, some in their bodies, and their bodies in their bodies' force, some in their garments, though newfangled ill,"
2689,445-123857-0012.flac," outbraves his dignity. for sweetest things turn sourced by their deeds, lilies that festers smell far worse than weeds."
2690,445-123857-0002.flac," all these i better in one general best. thy love is better than high birth to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments cost."
2691,445-123857-0008.flac," how like ease, apple, the thigh-beauty grow, if thy sweet virtue answer not, thy show."
2692,445-123857-0011.flac," the summer's flower is to the summer's sweet, though to itself it only live and die. but if that flower with base infection means the bassist weed"
2693,445-123857-0003.flac," since that my life on thy revolt, deathly."
2694,445-123857-0006.flac," in many's looks, the false heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange, but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell."
2695,445-123857-0001.flac," some in their hawks and towns, some in their horse. and every humor hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest. but these particulars are not my measure."
2696,4137-11702-0024.flac," by the way, he added, henry is marrying and settling down in barodia. it is curious, curious, he went on, how after a war, one's thoughts turned to matrimony. he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this."
2697,4137-11702-0060.flac," hiasinth put out her hand, and coronel pressed it encouragingly. his royal highness prince udo, she said,"
2698,4137-11702-0008.flac, hiasinth would be growing up and getting married soon. life would be lonely in eurelia then. unless... should he risk it?
2699,4137-11702-0042.flac," may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the brodyans? from the little i have gathered outside, it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred. but of course i am long-eity. long-eity, long-eity, hear the full story from your majesty's own lips."
2700,4137-11702-0027.flac," can you keep a secret?"" he asked, mr. mr. mysteriously. of course, said hyacinth, deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told koranel. well, then listen."
2701,4137-11702-0021.flac," well, said merrowig, remembering just in time, i-er killed him. oh father, i-er killed him. oh father, i-er killed him. oh father, how rough of you view. i don't think it hurt him very much, my dear."
2702,4137-11702-0035.flac," no matter, dear, we can easily find you plenty more, we can find you plenty more, suitors. indeed, the subject has been very near my thoughts lately. we'll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighboring countries. there'll be no lack of candidates."
2703,4137-11702-0057.flac," he came to stay with you, and he never—his royal highness put in coronel—has given his affections to another. uh-huh, so that's the secret. now i wonder if i can guess who she is."
2704,4137-11702-0022.flac," see, i have brought these home for you. he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper. oh, how exciting! whatever can it be? merwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers."
2705,4137-11702-0030.flac," to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings, and by and by the moment came of which kora nell had spoken. and now, said merowig,"
2706,4137-11702-0032.flac," ""'father,' she said, stroking his hand where i rested on his knee. ""'i have got some news for you.' ""'nothing about the count. nothing but the count. nothing serious, i hope,' said merrowaigan, alarm."
2707,4137-11702-0054.flac," that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia. there is only one man who could have got those. truly an excellent young man. well, we'll arrange something, said merrowig, looking pleased."
2708,4137-11702-0003.flac," he had been discovered by the chief armorer of barodia at full length on the wet grass searching for tracks. the chief armorer, a kindly man,"
2709,4137-11702-0019.flac," now, father, said hyacinth later on, when merrowick, later on, when merrowick had changed his clothes and refreshed himself. you've got———————————————————————"
2710,4137-11702-0000.flac," a contemporary poet of the country. king marrowig, the first, drove back from war. as many other kings had done before, 500 men behind him were in sight. left right, left right, left right, left right, left right."
2711,4137-11702-0007.flac," poor little highest and left all alone, but there she had had the countess bellevane, a woman of great experience to help her. bellevane. should he risk it? how much had she thought of him while he was away?"
2712,4137-11702-0006.flac," were in his pocket, days of honored leisure were waiting for him. he gazed at each remembered landmark of his own beloved country, his heart overflowing with thankfulness. never again would he leave eurelia. how good to see highest in the game."
2713,4137-11702-0009.flac," he must be longing to tell you that. oh, he'll have a hundred things to tell you first. but then when he says, and what's been happening here while i've been away, nothing much i suppose, then you can say."
2714,4137-11702-0029.flac, and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent.
2715,4137-11702-0017.flac," here he turned and embraced his daughter again, and if his eye traveled over her shoulder in the direction of belvain's garden, it is a small matter, and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame."
2716,4137-11702-0031.flac," nothing much, i suppose. he waited nervously, wondering if hyacinth would realize that all was meant to include more particularly bellevaine. hyacinth drew a stool up to her father's chair and sat down very close to him."
2717,4137-11702-0046.flac," there are certain state reasons,"" he said, said, said, with dignity. why that story has been allowed to get about. part in your majesty. i have no wish to. but as you know so much, you may as well know all."
2718,4137-11702-0045.flac," he would say, these are matters for men to discuss. but hyacinth would know, no, no, quite well why she had been sent out, and would certainly tell cornell the truth of the matter afterwards. he matter afterwards. it really looked as if cornell would have to be led into the secret too."
2719,4137-11702-0010.flac," then i shall say nothing much only coronel and such a clever. oh, i have clever. oh, i have my ideas,"" said coronel. well, i'll be out of the way somewhere. i think i'll go for a walk in the forest."
2720,4137-11702-0058.flac, what do you say to the princess elvira of trigong? i know his father had hopes in that direction. hysin flipped round at coronel as if appealing for his support. he took a step towards her.
2721,4137-11702-0037.flac," my dear, this is indeed news. tell me all about it. upon what quest did you send him? highest senthed felt this coming."
2722,4137-11702-0026.flac, i can't plant them in the garden. i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia. i did in barodia. isn't that a little unkind now that the poor man's dead? i did. i did. marrow wig looked around him to see that there were no eavesdroppers.
2723,4137-11702-0040.flac," and who might coronel be? said the king rather sternly. he's—he's—well, he's—here he is, father. she ran up to him, and possibly as he came in at the door."
2724,4137-11702-0036.flac," let me see. there's that seven-headed bull. he's getting a little—a little—a little old now, but he was good enough for the last one. we might—i don't want a suitor,"" said hyacinus softly. i have one. marrowig lent forward with eagerness."
2725,4137-11702-0059.flac," no, it's not the princess elvira,"" said hy-hy-hy-synth, a little nervously. the king laughed good-humouredly. oh, well, you must tell me, he said."
2726,4137-11702-0051.flac," and so you, i understand wish to marry my daughter? does that surprise your majesty? well, no, it doesn't. and she, i understand, wishes to marry you. yes, please, father."
2727,4137-11702-0023.flac," neatly tied up with blue ribbon. father, he picked out the left one, fawns at orico, if he had known any latin, of the war and held it up for highest incinspection. there you can see the place where henry small knows his arrow bent it,"
2728,4137-11702-0011.flac," or shall i stay here in the countess's garden, and am i the countess's garden, and am i the countess's garden, and am used myself with udo? anyhow, i'll give you an hour alone together first. the cavalcade drew up in front of the castle, handkerchiefs fluttered to them from the walls, trumpets were blown, hounds bade,"
2729,4137-11702-0034.flac," i sent them off an adventures of some kind, but dear me, i mean, i mean, yes, they ought to have been back by now. i suppose you haven't heard anything of them? no father said high-synth with a little smile. ah, well, no doubt they were unsuccessful."
2730,4137-11702-0014.flac," he took a step, step, step forward and addressed his troops. men of eurelia, tears, we have returned, returned, returned from a long and arduous conflict. tears, to embraces, loud tears,"
2731,4137-11702-0012.flac," down the steps came high a synth, all blue and gold, and flung herself into her father's arms. my dear child, said merwig as he patted her soothingly. they're there. it's your old father come back again. hrm, they're there."
2732,4137-11702-0049.flac," tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war, and how you pretended to be a swine herd, and how could put any father have resisted in a little while, high-synth and coronel, or seated eagerly at his feet."
2733,4137-11702-0004.flac," henry, having caught a glimpse of the chief armorer's daughter, had accepted without any false pride, and had frequently dropped in to suffer thereafter. now that the war was over, he found that he could not tear himself away."
2734,4137-11702-0053.flac," and he saw, once, that he knew a good story when he heard one. of course, he said, you'll have to win her. anything your majesty sets me to do is as well. he added with a disarming smile."
2735,4137-11702-0041.flac," oh, cornell, you're just in time. do tell father who you are."" cornell bowed profoundly to the king king king. before i explain myself, your majesty, he said."
2736,4137-11702-0002.flac," henry small-nose, a bowman of considerable promise, had been left behind in the enemy's country, the one casualty of war, while spying out the land in the early days of the invasion."
2737,4137-11702-0005.flac," with king marrowigg's permission, he was settling in barodia, and with the chief armorer's permission, he was starting on his new life as a married man. as the towers of the castle came in sight, marrowigg drew a deep breath of happiness, home again,"
2738,4137-11702-0047.flac," it happened like this. once more he told the story of his, of his midnight visit and of the and of the king's letter to him. but your majesty cried coronal."
2739,4137-11702-0015.flac," of our mothers and wives and daughters, prolonged cheering, as the case may be. hear here."
2740,4137-11702-0038.flac," what is his income? a man must prove his worth in some way. i haven't sent him away at all yet,"" she said. he's only just come. he's been very kind to me, and i'm sure you'll love him. well, well, we'll arrange something for him."
2741,4137-11702-0020.flac," said merrowake heartily, we shant have any trouble in that direction again, i fancy."" do tell me, did the king of barodia apologize? he did better than that. he abdicated. why?"
2742,4137-11702-0028.flac," he told her of his secret journey, secret journey to the king of brodieus tent. he told her of the king of brodieus letter."
2743,4137-11702-0039.flac," by the way, who is he? he comes from arabic and his name is udo. but udo, of course. why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement by deer? it isn't deer. it isn't deer. it isn't udo, i'm afraid, father. it's coronel."
2744,4137-11702-0013.flac," he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down. my little hyacinth, my own little girl. oh, father, i am glad to have you back. there, there, my child."
2745,4137-11702-0025.flac, but she was still engrossed with the whiskers.
2746,4137-11702-0056.flac," wait till he has seen them, my dear,"" said marrowig with the chuckle. he has seen them, father. what? you invited him here?"
2747,4137-11702-0055.flac," perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor, too?"" haya synthen coronel interchanged a smile. a last-f-f-fother, she said. his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms."
2748,4137-11702-0050.flac," and he was telling once more the great story and he had more the great story of his adventures. well, well,"" said the king at the end of it, when he had received their tribute of admiration. those are just a few of the little adventures that happened in wartime. he turned to coronel."
2749,4137-11702-0044.flac," he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure, an adventure after his own heart. no, wig was in an awkward position. he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room. leave us my child."
2750,4137-11702-0018.flac," there was another storm of cheers, the battle cry of eurelia. ho, ho, marrowig was shouted from five hundred throats, and the men dispersed happily to their homes. hyacinth and marrowig went into the palace."
2751,4137-11702-0033.flac," it's rather serious, but it's rather nice. father, you're nice. father, you're nice. father, dear, would you mind very much if i got married soon? my dear, you shall get married as soon as you like. let me see, there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day."
2752,4137-11702-0016.flac," in honor of our great victory, i decree that from now onwards, tomorrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout eurelia. terrific cheering."
2753,4137-11702-0052.flac," that, said coronel simply, is much more surprising. merrowick, however, was not so sure of that. he liked the look of coronel. he liked his manner."
2754,4137-11702-0043.flac, is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of brodie's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him? there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it.
2755,4137-11702-0001.flac," so far as known, this was her only work, but she built up some reputation on it, and belvain, who was a good judge, had a high opinion of her genius. to be exact, there were only 499 men."
2756,4137-11702-0048.flac," so you like it, said merrowig, trying to look modest. i love it. i knew he'd love it. i knew he'd love it. i knew he'd love it. put in high, in high, in high, in. it's just the sort of story that cornel would love."
2757,4137-11701-0004.flac," in case something happens, what should happen? i don't know, but all our life together has been in the forest, and i'm just a little afraid of the world."
2758,4137-11701-0027.flac," there's no holding out at once he begins. volunteered begins. volunteered begins. volunteered quarno. he's the most desperate lover in arabic. my father will be so excited when he hears,"" said hyacinth."
2759,4137-11701-0045.flac," was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for, after all, he had been no more gallant than it was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman. it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions."
2760,4137-11701-0014.flac," the princess and coronel were upon them. they were upon them. were upon them. ah, countess, i thought we should find you together,"" said hyacinth archley. let me present to you my friend, the duke coronel."
2761,4137-11701-0036.flac," we can talk quite well like this. i am sorry, udo, udo,"" said coronel meekley. we seem to have made a mistake, but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position. it wasn't in the least compromising."
2762,4137-11701-0010.flac," father will make you a proper prince, directly he comes back. will he? he? that's what i'm wondering. you see, he doesn't know yet about our little present to the countess. but it is quite time we got back to belvain. we have left her alone too long."
2763,4137-11701-0041.flac," you never, never, never told me. your precious countess whom you expect me, expect me to marry. how very unkind of her, if her, a nasty person to annoy. he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully,"
2764,4137-11701-0026.flac," said hyacinth. i felt somehow that it must be coming, because you've seen so much of each other lately. wigs and i have often talked about it together. what has happened to the child, thought bill vane? she isn't a child at all. she's grown up."
2765,4137-11701-0013.flac," he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvain's face. she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him. why, whoever is this, she said, getting to her feet? before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon,"
2766,4137-11701-0043.flac," yes, but of course the chance might come again. you have the thing hanging over you always. she's clever you know, and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy. lovely flowers, aren't they? what's the name of this one?"
2767,4137-11701-0034.flac," yes, i think you may take our word for it that it's true. i haven't the slightest intention. what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for?"
2768,4137-11701-0038.flac," ah, and who would listen, ah, and who would listen, ah, and who would listen to a hopeless story like that."
2769,4137-11701-0050.flac," i must ask you not to refer to it, i do it, i do it, do it. if i marry the countess, you'll be a very lucky man, put in coronel. i happen to know that the king of eurelia, however, she's chosen you, it seems."
2770,4137-11701-0033.flac, there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now.
2771,4137-11701-0040.flac," said udo stiffly. well, perhaps you are right. i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way. udo, who was about to enter the palace, turned round with a startled look. what do you mean?"
2772,4137-11701-0032.flac," he said, is the talk of the evil he, of the evil he, of the arabi? naturally, i had to come here to see for myself what she was like. my dear udo, she's charming. i congratulate you. don't be a fool, coronel. i haven't the f*** he, coronel. i haven't the f*** he, coronel. i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her."
2773,4137-11701-0005.flac," be very close coronel, she whispered, and then they walked out together. if any of the servants of the palace were surprised to see coronel, they did not show it. after all, that was their business."
2774,4137-11701-0021.flac," explained hyacinth. and hearing that there was to be a wedding added coronel, exited coronel, it had coronel. bellevaine made up her mind. coronel was evidently a very different man from udo. if he stayed in eurelia as advisor,"
2775,4137-11701-0006.flac," prince cornell will be staying here,"" said the princess. prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both. and if they discuss those things in the servants' halls of those days,"
2776,4137-11701-0022.flac," more than advisor she guessed, she guessed, to hyacinth, her own position would not be in much doubt. and that's for the king, it might be months before he came back, and when he did come, would he remember her?"
2777,4137-11701-0008.flac," but i get no assistance from roger at this point. he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders. i say, eh,"" said cornell, as they went up the grand staircase. i am not a prince, you know. don't say i have deceived you."
2778,4137-11701-0024.flac," udo and i, here, i, here, i, here, she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronels, took udo's boldly without any more maidenly nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. udo and i love each other. say something udo."
2779,4137-11701-0015.flac," udo is one of my oldest friends. he turned and clapped that boob-a-wildered highness on the back. aren't you udo? and i- black. aren't you udo? and i can think of no one more suitable in every way. he bowed again and turned back to the prince. well, udo, you're looking splendid."
2780,4137-11701-0003.flac," it will annoy your father, but one can't please ever, ever, ever be everybody. oh, i can see myself enjoying this."" they got up and wandered back along wings' path, hand in hand. ""'i'm almost afraid to leave the forest,' said hyacinth."
2781,4137-11701-0031.flac," and now, the prince, tell me what you are doing here. cornell, put his arm in udo's and walked him up and down the flagged path. you're approaching marriage."
2782,4137-11701-0020.flac," i rode,"" said coronel. it's a secret,"" he added."
2783,4137-11701-0042.flac, udo evidently hadn't thought of this. he did this. he did this. he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened. she couldn't do anything.
2784,4137-11701-0011.flac," it was more than udo did. just now he was with her in her garden, telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with the dragon, apparently in its dotage, to which belvin was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator."
2785,4137-11701-0047.flac," after all, again, why not marry the countess? it was absurd to suppose there was anything in cornel's nonsense. nonsense. but one never knew, not that he was marrying her out of fear. no, certainly not. they was simply a chivalrous whim on his part."
2786,4137-11701-0030.flac," and with a curtsy, she was gone. coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth. i'm enjoying this, he seems to say. well! well! well! she announced. i must be going into. there'll be much to see about."
2787,4137-11701-0039.flac," once more, i am not going to marry her. well, you must please yourself, but you have compromised her severely with that story. poor innocent girl. well, let's forget about it. and now tell me, how do you like eurelia?"
2788,4137-11701-0028.flac," you know, of course, that his majesty comes back tomorrow with all his army. she did not swoon or utter a cry. she did not plead the vapors or the megrims."
2789,4137-11701-0035.flac," oh, very well, if you're going to drop all your former friends, go on then. but when i'm married, there will always be a place for… understand, once, and for all,"" said udo engrily, that i am not getting married. no, don't take my arm."
2790,4137-11701-0017.flac," oh, what a miracle worker true love is. i think one of the things which made bellevaine so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say."
2791,4137-11701-0051.flac," personally, i can't make out what she sees in you. what is it? put it, put it. i should have thought it was quite obvious. it was quite obvious,"" said udo with dignity. well, cornel, i think perhaps you are right, and that it's my duty to marry her."
2792,4137-11701-0037.flac, protested udo indignantly.
2793,4137-11701-0007.flac," no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth, blessed her pretty face, had found her man at last."
2794,4137-11701-0046.flac," of course, he ought to have left you really, really a long ago. but he had stayed on, and well, decidedly she was beautiful, perhaps he had paid, paid, paid rather too much attention to that. and he had certainly neglected the princess a little."
2795,4137-11701-0025.flac," prompted coronal. er, yes, said udo very unwillingly, and decided that he would explain it all afterwards. whatever his feelings for the countis, he was not going to be rushed into a marriage. oh, i'm so glad!"
2796,4137-11701-0019.flac," the countess and i were just having a little—i was just telling her what you said about. how did you get here, cornell?"" she'll we tell him? said cornell with a smile at hyacinth. hyacinth nodded."
2797,4137-11701-0048.flac," the poor woman had misunderstood him, and she should be that we should not be disappointed. she seems fond of flowers, said coronel. you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you. now understand clearly coronel."
2798,4137-11701-0023.flac," we didn't want it to be known yet,"" she said giley, but you have guessed our secret, your royal highness. she looked modestly at the ground, and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on."
2799,4137-11701-0018.flac," meanwhile, udo, of course, of course, of course, blundered along galey. we aren't exactly princess, i mean, what are you doing here, cornel? that's not your cornel. i didn't know princess that you..."
2800,4137-11701-0052.flac, cornell shook him solemnly by the hand. i congratulate your royal highness. i will announce your decision to the princess. she will be much delighted. and he turned into the palace.
2801,4137-11701-0009.flac," ""'you are my prince,' said hyacinth proudly. ""'my dear, i am a king among men today, and you are my queen, but that's in our own special country of two.' ""'if you are so particular,' said hyacinth with a smile."
2802,4137-11701-0012.flac," and then, said udo, i jumped quickly to the right and whirling my—no, wait a bit, that was later—i jumped quickly to my left. yes, i remember it now. it was my left. i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my—"
2803,4137-11701-0029.flac," she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life. then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace. she said, if your royal highness will excuse me."
2804,4137-11701-0016.flac, a different thing counters from when i last saw him.
2805,4137-11701-0044.flac," udo dropped undecidedly into a seat. this is as wanted thinking out. the countess, what was wrong with her after all? and she evidently adored him. of course that was not surprising. the question was."
2806,4137-11701-0049.flac," i'm not in the least frightened by the countess. my dear udo, what a speech for a lover! of course you're not! after all, what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again."
2807,4137-11701-0002.flac," we will be her most humble obedient servants. she shall have everything she wants. including... including prince udo, smiled hyacinth. that's a splendid and undenunded idea. we'll make her have udo."
2808,4137-11701-0001.flac," that's what makes it so jolly. we can do what we like and it doesn't matter if it doesn't come off, so just for fun, let's think of something to pay her out. i feel i don't want to hurt anybody today. be today today. alright, we won't hurt her, we'll humor her."
2809,4137-11701-0000.flac," and now, said coronel, we'd better, better, better decide what to do. but i don't mind what we do now,"" said hyacinth happily. she may have the throne and father and udo and—"
2810,4018-107338-0025.flac," lawfully meeting an open day, and their delegates from the whole realm, from declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race, which has in vain endeavored to degrade them."
2811,4018-107338-0032.flac," i'll not tell you what i would do for you, my good gerard. you would think me foolish, but i am alone in—but i am alone in—but i am alone in the world in seeing you again and talking of old times. i really am scarcely fit for business."""
2812,4018-107338-0022.flac," you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means. do you not? what then is there to fear here? here. and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive? all is very well at this moment, said morley, and all may continue well."
2813,4018-107338-0028.flac," the factions and the failures of our oppressors. at this moment, gerard and hatton, who were sitting in the remote part of the room, rose together and advanced forward, and this movement interrupted the conversation of civil and morally."
2814,4018-107338-0024.flac," morley shrugged his shoulders and then said, an easy question. questions are always easy. the fact is, in active life, one cannot afford to refine. i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape."
2815,4018-107338-0023.flac," but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirit, psybel, psybel. your father takes a leading part. he is a great hariter, and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life. it does not much suit me. i am a man of the closet."
2816,4018-107338-0021.flac," the factions become united. civil turned, the united. civil turned and looked at him and then said, and what could have happened tomorrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us? do not they know everything? do not you meet in their very sight?"
2817,4018-107338-0030.flac, is the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land. but can we prove it? we never had the legal evidence. you are an error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence. mir memoranda
2818,4018-107338-0018.flac," you are right, said morally, looking at her rather keenly. we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat. i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten,"
2819,4018-107338-0026.flac," there can be other than one and the same object? a thousand, said morley. we have already, as many parties, as insane stevens itself. you terrify me, since i will. i knew we had fearful odds to combat against."
2820,4018-107338-0019.flac, he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family. and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them.
2821,4018-107338-0017.flac," had he not accompanied me to this store and met my father, which precipitated an explanation on his part, which he found had not been given by others, i might have remained in an ignorance which, hereafter, might have produced inconvenience."
2822,4018-107338-0031.flac," very useful, no doubt, i hope it shall find them, but of no validity. if money with the only difficulty, trust me, it should not be wanting. i owe much to the memory of your father, my good juard. i would fain serve you and your daughter."
2823,4018-107338-0020.flac," and yet, if anything were to happen tomorrow, said morley, rest assured this man has his eye on us. he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale, for though one of the pseudo-opposition, the moment the people move,"
2824,4018-107338-0027.flac," my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies, but i believe that we had on our side, my side, my side, god and the truth. they know neither of them in the national convention said morally."
2825,4018-107338-0029.flac, saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed. you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right. i believe on every principle of justice that mobri castle is as much yours
2826,4018-107338-0008.flac, is yours at life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer.
2827,4018-107338-0012.flac," he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment. one observing that it was westminster, he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour, and that if not inconvenient to me,"
2828,4018-107338-0009.flac," then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance, she held forth her hand, which she retained for a moment, and with withdrew. i was with him more than an hour continued morally. at first he recollected nothing."
2829,4018-107338-0004.flac," and was associated with so many strange and high hopes, and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts. hatton, in his appearance, realized little of the fancies."
2830,4018-107338-0016.flac," the best best best bestification of which we had been jubes. and you did wrong, said sybil. there was no wisdom like frankness. had you told me he would not have been here today, he met and addressed me, and i only recognized an acquaintance"
2831,4018-107338-0001.flac," perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father, said hatton, scanning charard with his clear blue eye, and then he added, he was of great service to me and my youth, and one is not apt to forget such things."
2832,4018-107338-0005.flac," that appearance was pre-possessing. a frank and even benevolent expression, played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance. his once rich brown hair, still long, though very thin."
2833,4018-107338-0007.flac," is the privilege of the people. of whom i am one, i am one, i am one, said hathen bowing, well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a charters delegate. but is your labor there, is your labor there, labor, sensible?"
2834,4018-107338-0003.flac," and as he was speaking these words, he turned and addressed them to cible. she beheld it with no little interest, this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young years."
2835,4018-107338-0014.flac," you did well, good, good, good, steve, and as you always do,"" said sybil, with amusing ellipses-tracted air. no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you. he threw a glance at her, and immediately withdrew it. their eyes had met."
2836,4018-107338-0015.flac," hers were kind and calm. and this egrimon said morally, rather hurriedly and abruptly, and looking on the ground, how came he here, when we discovered him yesterday, your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the"
2837,4018-107338-0011.flac," this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest. at first, at first he talked of writing to see her father, and i offered that gerard should call upon him."
2838,4018-107338-0010.flac," he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed—he destroyed papers—would order research to be made for them and so on. i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father, what he was doing, and whether he were married and had children."
2839,4018-107338-0013.flac," he would propose that i should at once accompany him. i thought, whatever might be the result, it must be a satisfaction to gerard, at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought he what not so much. and so we are here."
2840,4018-107338-0000.flac," morleep. morleep. morleep, morleep, as he recognized egremont. then, advancing to gerard, followed by his companion, he said, this is mr. hatton of whom we were speaking last night, and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours."
2841,4018-107338-0006.flac, detract from the favorable effect that he always at once produced.
2842,4018-107338-0002.flac, and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted.
2843,4018-107312-0003.flac," in the infancy of mobri by some mill owner, not sufficiently prophetic in the future, or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labors"
2844,4018-107312-0015.flac," i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines. sola live, but those shuffling screw are rotten, snickie, bad yarns, and mistress carry."
2845,4018-107312-0021.flac," what makes you drink but toil? working from five o'clock in the morning is what is seven o'clock at night, and for the like of such as you. that's a good one, said the use. i should like to know what my mother ever did for me, but give me treacle and laud, and when i was a babby."
2846,4018-107312-0027.flac," so it is, said the girl, but then it was so dull, i can't stand a country life, mrs. carrey, i must have company. well, i do love a bit of gossip myself,"" said mrs. carrey, with great frankness."
2847,4018-107312-0033.flac," well, we had no thoughts. no thoughts, but i said to harriet, as it is a fine night, that night, let us walk about as long as we can, and then tomorrow we will lie in bed till afternoon."
2848,4018-107312-0012.flac," oh, the carnal monsters explain the widow. if they don't come, the bloody-minded naves. and for the small cops, too, small cops be hanged. am i the man to send him up a bad-bottom cop, widow-carry?"
2849,4018-107312-0037.flac," i propose to go with her, but to who girls alone you understand me. one does not like to be seen in these places as if one kept no company. very true, sidemick, and now we'll be off. good night, widow."
2850,4018-107312-0024.flac," it's very well known that i'm a man where pays his way, said the boy-boy, and don't keep a hoax to stall to sell carrion, and by starlight, but live in a two-pair if you please, and has a wife, wife, wife and family, or is good."
2851,4018-107312-0028.flac," and then i'm no scholar said the girl, and never could take the learning, and those traffords had so many schools. learning is better than house and lands that mrs. carey, though i'm no scholar myself, but then, in my time, things were different."
2852,4018-107312-0034.flac," but at this season of the year i must have life. the moment i came out i bathed in the river, but a river and then went home and dressed. he added in a satisfied tone. and now i am going to put into the temple. i'll tell you what. julia has been pricked today with a shuttle."
2853,4018-107312-0030.flac," we have got fifty members and taken three london papers, one northern star, and two moral worlds. and where you now, child, continued the widow to the girl."
2854,4018-107312-0036.flac, i was speaking of it the harry at last night.
2855,4018-107312-0001.flac," the dimensions of castle street were not unworthy of the metropolis. it traversed a great portion of the town, and it was proportionately wide. it was proportionately wide. its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity."
2856,4018-107312-0032.flac," and we shall be happy to see you, mick, and julia if you were not engaged, continued the girl, and she looked at her friend, a pretty demure girl, who immediately said, but in a somewhat faltering tone, oh, that we shall."
2857,4018-107312-0014.flac," so you do a soul widow, they pretend to give the same wages as the rest, and works it out in fine. you can't come and you can't go, but there's a fine. you're never paid wages, but there's a baked ticket."
2858,4018-107312-0035.flac," i'll stand, treat, and take you and your friend to the temple."" well, that's delight, said caroline. there's no one does the handsome thing like you, dandy mick, and i always say so. oh, i love the temple, it is so gentile."
2859,4018-107312-0007.flac," to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with cyble. this one was populous, noisy and lighted. it was saturday night, the streets were thronged, and infinite population kept swarming to and fro,"
2860,4018-107312-0020.flac, don't mother me said the me said the me said the jolly widow with the kindling guy go to your own mother who was dying in a backseller without a winder while you've got lodgings in a two pair dying dying dying she's only drunk said the youth
2861,4018-107312-0025.flac," said a good human voice. it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped. they were, she was, her stall and stopped. they were galley dressed, a light handkerchief tied under the chin, their hair scrupulously arranged, they wore coral netluses and earrings of gold."
2862,4018-107312-0019.flac," a high-crowned dark-brown hat, which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye. well, it's mischievous blue eye. well, it's mischievous blue eye. well, you need not be so fierce, mother kerry, said the youth with an effected air of deprecation."
2863,4018-107312-0026.flac," she added in a lower tone. well, i have left mr. trafford's mail, said the girl. that's a bad job, said mrs. carey, for those trafford's a kind to their people."
2864,4018-107312-0004.flac," would be the future eyesore of a flourishing posterity. pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile, gerard and stephen turned down a street which intersected it."
2865,4018-107312-0006.flac," that rose in all directions, clustering yet isolated, announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of mobury. crossing this open ground, they gained a suburb, but one of a very different description"
2866,4018-107312-0016.flac," wheel, indeed, you looked very like a soul as feeds on wheel, continued mrs. carey in an undertone as her declining customer moved away. well, it gets late, said the widow."
2867,4018-107312-0002.flac," while on each side of the street rose huge, rose huge, rose huge warehouses, not as beautiful as the palaces of venice, but in their way, not less remarkable, magnificent shops. and here and there, though rarely, some ancient factory built among the fields,"
2868,4018-107312-0013.flac," you sent up for snakes. i have known you, man and boy, john hill, these twenty summers, and never heard a word against you till you got into shuffle and screws, mill. oh, they are a bad yarn, john."
2869,4018-107312-0010.flac," still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase. and so it is widow, said a little pale man, the little pale man, wistfully. come, come, it's getting late, and your wife's, wife's, sale, you're a good soul."
2870,4018-107312-0023.flac," i never said mrs. carey. no, i never heard a thing like that. what? not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for a real cutlet's mother? hold your tongue, mr. imperence, said the widow. it's very well known you know christian and who will believe what you say."
2871,4018-107312-0017.flac," and if you like to take this scrag and home to your wife, neighbor hill, we can talk of the rest next saturday. and what you will, sir, said the widow, with a stern expression to her youth, who now stopped at her stall."
2872,4018-107312-0022.flac," to stop my tongue and fill my stomach. by the token of which, as my regal says, she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all mobri, all mobri. and here, to peer, to you through himself up, and thrust his hands into the side pockets of his pea jacket. well."
2873,4018-107312-0011.flac," were the mayor of moby-at-least. wages said the mayor— were the man—i wish you may get him— those villains shuffling— were those villains shuffling— were those villains shuffling— screw have starved me with another bait ticket, and a pretty vigor too."
2874,4018-107312-0018.flac," he was about sixteen with a live figure and a handsome faded impudent face. his long loose white trousers, long loose white trousers, gave him height. he had no waist cut, but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck."
2875,4018-107312-0005.flac," and so on, through a variety of ways, and ways, and ways, and winding lanes, till they arrived at an open portion of the town, a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared, and where the tall chimneys and bulky, barric-looking buildings"
2876,4018-107312-0029.flac," but young persons, yes, and mick, i don't think i could get through the day if it were no for our institute. and what's that, that's that, ask mrs. carey with a sneer? the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure, said mick."
2877,4018-107312-0008.flac," by narrow archways, like the entrance of hives, so low that you obliged to stoop, but obliged to stoop, but obliged to stoop for admission. while ascending to these same streets, from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps,"
2878,4018-107312-0000.flac, the chief street of mobury called castle street after the ruins of the old boronial stronghold in its neighborhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the hortie keep had been of its ancient dependence.
2879,4018-107312-0031.flac," if you will take a dish of tea with us tomorrow, we expect some friends. i take it kindly, said mrs. carey, and so you, and so you, and so you keep house together. all the children keep house, the children keep house in these days, times has changed indeed."
2880,4018-107312-0009.flac," the subterranean nation, the subterranean nation, subterranean nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest. the bright and lively shops were crowded, and groups of purchases were gathered round the stalls."
2881,4018-103416-0025.flac," also, he promised to be sole heir to a great business. if the war only lasted long enough. imagine you're knowing all those things, she said admiringly. you're a partner, aren't you? he flushed slightly."
2882,4018-103416-0019.flac," was the beauty of youth only, and that was only, and that that was going. late hours, golf, perhaps a little more champagne, and was necessary at dinners, and the mornings found her almost plain. and two,"
2883,4018-103416-0010.flac," i kept the library as long as i could. we can sit on the stairs, if you like."" which they proceeded to do quite amably. from various open doors came subdued voices. the air was pungent with tobacco smoke."
2884,4018-103416-0027.flac," well, go in and stir up some of the lovage she suggested, and if tommy hale hasn't burned up the piano we can dance a bit. you danced a bit. you danced a bit. you danced a vinyly, you know. it was after—no. it was after—no. it was after seven when he reached home. he felt every inch a man."
2885,4018-103416-0029.flac," his newfound maturity seemed—ewardy seemed to be slipping from him. somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy. honestly, mother, i'd rather go to father and tell him about it."
2886,4018-103416-0004.flac," the great six-month battle of the psalm, with its million casualties, was resulting favorably. on the east the russians had made some gains. there were wages that the germans would be done in the spring."
2887,4018-103416-0035.flac," and if we have, you won't go, and you have, you won't go, promise me you won't go. when he hesitated, she resorted to her old message with both clayton and the boy. she was doing all she could to make them happy. she made no demands, none."
2888,4018-103416-0037.flac," she was a really pathetic figure, crouched in her low chair, and shakened with terror. she must have a rather bad time. there were so many things she dared not take to his father. she brought them to him instead, her small grievances."
2889,4018-103416-0034.flac," your father needs you. he needs me to hell of a lock. your hell of a lock. hell of a lock, the boy muttered. but he went, your, your went over and stooping down, kissed, or trembling face. don't worry about your, at me, he said lightly. i don't think we've got spined enough to get into the mix of anyhow."
2890,4018-103416-0021.flac," were now sending flowers to the debutants and cutting in on the younger men at balls. her house was still a rendezvous, but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room, the library, and the music room that afternoon."
2891,4018-103416-0028.flac," he held himself very straight as he entered the house, and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler had given place to a dignified nod. natalie was in her dressing room. at his knock she told the maid to admit him."
2892,4018-103416-0033.flac," she was holding out both hands to him impidiously. you wouldn't go, would you? i might have to go, he evaded. you wouldn't go, he evaded. you wouldn't, graham, you're all i have, all i have left to live for. you wouldn't need to go. it's ridiculous. you're needed here."
2893,4018-103416-0030.flac," she ignored his protest, as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters. i'm accustomed to it, was her self-reply. but her resigned voice brought her, as it always had,"
2894,4018-103416-0000.flac," the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one. it was marked by an almost feverish guillotine, as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self-interest."
2895,4018-103416-0001.flac, mills and mills and mills and factories took on new life. labor was scarce and high. it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure. people played that they might not think. washington would think. washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved.
2896,4018-103416-0036.flac," but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her, it was refused, of course. she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money, and this was the gratitude she received. graham listened."
2897,4018-103416-0009.flac," and tea cups on most most of the furniture, and half smoked cigarettes on everything that would hold and hold them, including the piano. marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing-room door."
2898,4018-103416-0020.flac," she had the far vision of the calculating mind. she knew that if the country entered the war, every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer. at 25, she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers."
2899,4018-103416-0018.flac," her eyes slightly narrowed, watched him closely. she knew closely. she knew closely. she knew every move of the game she was determining to play. marion hayden, a 25, knew already what—ready what—ready what—her little world had not yet realized. it's such a beauty as she had had."
2900,4018-103416-0012.flac," no, twitch steer, but i can easily. mother, mary, and explained."
2901,4018-103416-0023.flac," they brought her centered tribute, flowers, candy and cigarettes."
2902,4018-103416-0024.flac," but more and more her dinder invitations were her dinder invitations were her dinder invitations were from the older crowd, like natalie spencer's stupid party tonight before, but party tonight before. so she watched graham and listened. he was a nice boy and a handsome one."
2903,4018-103416-0007.flac," he was rather, rather, rather bored now at the prospect. he would have preferred going to the club to play billions, which was his custom of a late afternoon. he drove rather more slowly than was his custom, and so missed marion's invitation to get there before the crowd."
2904,4018-103416-0013.flac," well, do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night? not exactly, but i meant them. i meant them. he looked up at her admiringly. he was only a year from college, and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debut haunts."
2905,4018-103416-0038.flac," and she had helped him out of a hole just now. ""'all right, i promise,' he said at last, ""'but you are worrying yourself for nothing, mother.' she was quite content, then, cheered at once, consulted the jeweled watch on her dressing table."
2906,4018-103416-0011.flac," permeated with a profane scent of late afternoon high-balls. tommy, marion, marion, marion called when she had settled herself. yes, from a distance. did you—did you—did you leave your cigarette on the piano?"
2907,4018-103416-0014.flac," since the night before he had been wrangling, wrangling under a sense of youth. was i pretty awful last night, he asked? you—snight, he asked. you—snight, he asked. you were very interesting, and i imagine, rather, indescreet."
2908,4018-103416-0016.flac," and i like big figures. poor people always do. poor people always do. has it really gone through? i mean those things do, and do, and do, and do slip-ups sometimes, don't they? it's gone through all right, sign, sealed, and delivered."
2909,4018-103416-0005.flac," but again, washington knew that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful. that the amount of loss territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held. that the food problem in the british islands was acute."
2910,4018-103416-0002.flac," kept its secret well, and continued to preach, continued to preach in neutrality it could not enforce. war was, to most of the nation, a great dramatic spectacle, presented to them at breakfast, and in the afternoon additions."
2911,4018-103416-0015.flac," about the new war contract. oh, business."
2912,4018-103416-0032.flac," when at a sound in clayton's room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket, into his pocket. have you noticed a change in your father's sentence he came back? her tone was so ominous that he started. he's not sick, is he?"
2913,4018-103416-0017.flac," encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work. he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise, and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder."
2914,4018-103416-0008.flac," three cars before the house showed that she already had callers, and indeed when the parliament opened the door, a burst of laughter greeted him. the hayden house was a general rendezvous. there were usually by seven o'clock whiskey and soda glasses"
2915,4018-103416-0026.flac," not yet, but of course i shall be. when you really get going, i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made. i'm the most ignorant person you ever knew. i'd be awfully glad to."
2916,4018-103416-0006.flac," that the submarine sinkings were colossal. our peace was at a fearful cost. and on the edge of this volcano, america played. when graham spencer left the mill that tuesday afternoon, it was to visit marion hayden."
2917,4018-103416-0003.flac," for the red cross and kindred, for the red cross and kindred, for the red cross and kindred activities. but although the war was in the nation's mind, it was not yet in its soul. life went on much as before, and abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency."
2918,4018-103416-0031.flac," the ready tribute of the boys, the boy's, the boy's sympathy. sit down, graham. i want to talk to you. he sat down still uneasily, the down still uneasily fingering the role of bills."
2919,4018-103416-0022.flac," they met there, smoked your cigarettes, made love in a corner, occasionally became engaged, but she was of the game no longer in it. men still came to see her a growing percentage of the married."
2920,412-126975-0034.flac," who rubbed his big fur gloves together. long before this revelation was complete, the two big doors of the porch had opened in the middle, and colonel adams, father of the furry young lady,"
2921,412-126975-0081.flac, we can act act act act it in this very hall. the audience sitting on those broad stairs opposite one row above another. these front doors can be the back scene either open or shut. shut.
2922,412-126975-0046.flac," i had to be careful of them coming down. they are the three great african diamonds called the flying stars, because they have been stolen so often. all the big criminals are on the track."
2923,412-126975-0005.flac," if i make myself clear, in the clear, in the green lawns and gray towers of some cathedral town. similarly, in france, when i had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant,"
2924,412-126975-0070.flac," and i find the thing, things extinct. nothing but a lot of sniveling fairy plays. i wanted to hot poker and a policeman made into sausages. and they give me princesses moralizing by moonlight, bluebirds."
2925,412-126975-0031.flac," which was rather a long, long process. a large, neat chauffeur in green got out from the front. and a small, small, neat man-servant in gray got out from the back. and between them, they deposited sir leopold on the doorstep,"
2926,412-126975-0003.flac," thus, squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak. while jews, jews, jews, on the other hand, should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless,"
2927,412-126975-0091.flac," to the coattails of sir lea holdfisher. this, however, was frowned down. uncle is two-ups to the- uncle is two-upsurred, cried ruby to crook, round whose shoulder she had seriously placed the string of sausages."
2928,412-126975-0038.flac," everything seemed undistinguished about the priest, even down to his name, which was brown. yet the colonel had always found something comparable about him, and frequently asked him to such family gatherings."
2929,412-126975-0035.flac," had come out himself to himself to himself to invite his eminent guest inside. he was a tall, sunburned and very silent man, who wore a red smoking cap like a fuzz, making him look like one of the english serders."
2930,412-126975-0085.flac," as always happens, the invention grew wilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had to create. the columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt."
2931,412-126975-0009.flac, a house with a monkey tree. enough. you know the species. i really think my imitation of dickens' style was dexterous and literary. it seems almost a pity.
2932,412-126975-0004.flac," among the lights and screens of the lights and screens of the cafe reach. thus, in england, if i wished to relieve a deen of his riches, which is not so easy as you might suppose, i wished to frame him"
2933,412-126975-0084.flac," but they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry that lives when youth is in a house. and youth was in that house that night, though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from which it flamed."
2934,412-126975-0064.flac," i like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat, hat, hat. not on mine, please,"" said sir leopold fisher, with dignity. well, well, observed crook, airily."
2935,412-126975-0040.flac," were unduly large in proportion to the house, and to the house, and formed as it were, as it were, as it were, a big room with the front door at one end, and the bottom of the staircase at the other. in front of the large hall-fire,"
2936,412-126975-0049.flac," i won't have you talking like that, cried the girl who was in a curious glow. you've only talked like that since you became a horrid what's his name. you know what i mean?"
2937,412-126975-0053.flac," put in the priest in a low voice, to own your own suit. crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect. does one want to own suit? he asked. one might."
2938,412-126975-0045.flac," fisher stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl. the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the colonel, the wonder of the whole group."
2939,412-126975-0061.flac," that famous french acrobat and comic actor. i knew him years ago out west. he went to go out west. he was a french canadian by birth. and he seems to have business for me, though i hardly hardly guess what."
2940,412-126975-0054.flac," with speculation in his eye. i've heard that gardeners use it. and i once made six children happy at christmas when the conjurer didn't come, entirely with soot, applied externally."
2941,412-126975-0027.flac," and stood throbbing. ""'hello, hello,' said the young man with the red tie. here's somebody born on the right side anyhow. i didn't know, miss adams, that your santa claus was so modern as this."""
2942,412-126975-0056.flac," and the astonished financier his in some considerable deprecation. when a knock sounded at the double front doors, the priest opened them and they showed again the front garden of evergreens, monkey tree and all."
2943,412-126975-0094.flac," went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. the spectators were few, relations, one or two local friends,"
2944,412-126975-0051.flac," a radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes, remarked crook, with some impatience. and a conservative does not mean a man who preserves jam. neither, i assure you."
2945,412-126975-0020.flac," this showed the more plainly, plainly plainly, because he wore an aggressive red tie. the only- i. the only part of his costume of what he seemed to take any care. perhaps it was a symbol."
2946,412-126975-0050.flac," a saint said father brown, brown, brown. i think said sir, sir, sir, sirly appalled with a supercellious smile that ruby means a socialist."
2947,412-126975-0037.flac," with him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighboring roman church, from the neighboring roman church. for the colonel's late wife had been a catholic, and the children, as is common in such cases, had been trained to follow her."
2948,412-126975-0044.flac," it was just as if a crystal fountain had spurred in their eyes. in a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs, three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all around them."
2949,412-126975-0018.flac," oh, don't jump, mr. crook. she called out in some alarm. it's much too high. the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse."
2950,412-126975-0047.flac," but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them. i might have lost them on the road here. it was quite possible. quite natural, i should say."
2951,412-126975-0006.flac," which is almost impossible. it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a gray line of clipped poplars, and though solemn planes of gall over which broods the mighty spirit of melee."
2952,412-126975-0043.flac," with an unaffected vain glory, with an unaffected vain glory that had something disarming about it, he held out the case before them all. it flew open at a touch and half blinded them."
2953,412-126975-0021.flac," he took no notice of the girl's alarmed adoration, but girls alarmed adoration, but girls alarmed adoration, but left like a grasshopper to the ground beside her. er, he might very well have broken his legs. i think i was meant to be a burglar."
2954,412-126975-0068.flac," what i say is, let's do something for the company tonight. not blacking faces are sitting on hats if you don't like those. but something of the sort. why couldn't we have a proper old english pantomime?"
2955,412-126975-0039.flac," in the large entrance hall of the house, there was ample room even for sir leopold and the removal of his wraps. ports and vestibule, indeed,"
2956,412-126975-0063.flac," he'll black his face if that's what you mean, cried blount laughing. i don't doubt he'd black everyone else's eyes. i don't care. i'm not refined."
2957,412-126975-0002.flac," i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself, choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe as if for a statuary group."
2958,412-126975-0059.flac," mr. blount started and stopped in his shout of his scent. ripping up the envelope with the envelope with the envelope with evident astonishment he read it. his face clouded a little and then cleared, and he turned to his brother-in-law in host."
2959,412-126975-0082.flac," you see an english interior, open, a moonlit garden. it all goes by magic. and snatching a chance piece of billiard chalk from his pocket, he ran it across the hall floor."
2960,412-126975-0078.flac," you must get someone else for pantalune. i will be pantalune, if you like,"" said colonel adams, taking his cigar out of his mouth, and speaking for the first and last time."
2961,412-126975-0007.flac," well, my last crime was a christmas crime. a cheery, cozy, english middle-class crime. a crime of charles dickens."
2962,412-126975-0030.flac," had not heard of him. for in certain articles, and articles in the clarion, or the new age, sir leopold had been dealt with austerely. but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motor car."
2963,412-126975-0042.flac," still seemed struggling with portions of his well-lined attire, and at length produced from a very interior tale-coat pocket, a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his christmas present for his goddaughter."
2964,412-126975-0067.flac," letting a top hat sit on you, for instance, said the socialist. now now now now, cried, now now now, cried the canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence. don't let spoil a jolly evening."
2965,412-126975-0019.flac," was a tall, angular young man, man, with dark hair sticking up like a hairbrush, intelligent and even distinguished linomints, but a salo and almost alien complexion."
2966,412-126975-0087.flac," like all true christian benefactors, anonymous. the harlequin, harlequin, already clad in silver paper out of cigar boxes, was with difficulty"
2967,412-126975-0079.flac," you ought to have a statue,"" cried the canadian, as he came back radiant from the telephone. there, there, there, we are all fitted. mr. crook shall be clowned."
2968,412-126975-0069.flac," clown, columbine, and so on. i saw one when i left england at 12 years old, and it's blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since. bonfire ever since. bonfire ever since. i came back to the old country only last year."
2969,412-126975-0057.flac," now go gather in gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset. the scene thus framed was so colored in quaint, like a backscene in a play, that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the door."
2970,412-126975-0001.flac," was also by a singular coincidence my last. it was committed at christmas. as an artist,"
2971,412-126975-0072.flac," it's a better definition of socialism than some recently given. but surely the get-up would be too big a business. not a scrap, cried blound, quite carried away."
2972,412-126975-0025.flac," and which is the right side of the wall? ask the young lady, smiling. whichever side you are on, said, one, said, one, said the young man named crook."
2973,412-126975-0011.flac," it was perfectly incomprehensible, and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it yet yet. from this standpoint, the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable"
2974,412-126975-0060.flac," i'm sick at being such a nuisance, being such a nuisance, colonel,"" he said, with the cheery colonial conventions, cheery colonial conventions. but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here tonight on business? in point of fact it's florian."
2975,412-126975-0010.flac," i repented the same evening. flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside, and even from the inside it was odd. seen from the outside,"
2976,412-126975-0052.flac, does a socialist mean a man who desires a social evening with the chimney sweep? a socialist means a man who wants all the chimney swept and all the chimney sweeps paid for it. but who won't allow you?
2977,412-126975-0014.flac," the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening, and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds, filling them, as it were, with the ghosts of the dead roses."
2978,412-126975-0041.flac," over which hung the kernels soared, the process was completed and the company, including the saturnian crook, presented to sir leopold fisher. that venerable finance here, however,"
2979,412-126975-0012.flac," opened on the garden with the monkey tree, and a young girl came out with bread to come out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day. she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes."
2980,412-126975-0093.flac," she said, and left the string of sausages swinging. father brown, though he knew every detail done behind the scenes, and had even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime baby,"
2981,412-126975-0073.flac," a harlequin aids the quickest thing we can do for two reasons. first, one can gag to any degree, and second, all the objects are household things."
2982,412-126975-0029.flac," ruby adams added. he is very kind. john crook, journalist, had heard of that eminent city magnate, and it was not his fault if the city magnate."
2983,412-126975-0062.flac," of course, of course, of course, replied the colonel carelessly. my dear, dear, dear chap, any friend of yours. no doubt he will prove an acquisition."
2984,412-126975-0071.flac," or something. blue beards more in my line, and him i like best, he turned into the pantaloon. i'm all for making a policeman into sausages,"" said john crook."
2985,412-126975-0089.flac," she had worn at a fancy dress party as the queen of diamonds. indeed, her uncle, james blount, was getting almost out of hand in his excitement. he was like a schoolboy."
2986,412-126975-0074.flac," tables, and towel horses, and washing baskets, and things like that. that's true. admit the hook, not eagerly, and walking about. but i'm afraid i can't have my policemen's uniform."
2987,412-126975-0008.flac," i did it in a good old middle-class house near putney, a house with a crescent of carriage drive, a house with a stable by the side of it, a house with the name on the two outer gates."
2988,412-126975-0066.flac," led fisher to say, in his most sarcastic, magisterial manner. no doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat. what is it, pray?"
2989,412-126975-0023.flac," how can you say such things?"" she remonstrated. well, said the young, young man. if you're born on the wrong side of the wall, i can't see that it's wrong to climb over it."
2990,412-126975-0013.flac," but her figure was beyond conjecture, for she was so wrapped up in brown fur, that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur. but for the attractive face, she might have been a small, totalling bear."
2991,412-126975-0024.flac," i never know what you will say or do next,"" she said. i don't often know myself,"" replied mr. crook. but then i am on the right side of the wall now."
2992,412-126975-0028.flac," oh, that's my godfather, sir leopold fisher. he always comes on boxing day. then after an innocent pause, which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm,"
2993,412-126975-0026.flac," as they went together through the laurels toward the front garden, a motorhorn sounded thrice, coming nearer and nearer, and a car of splendid speed, great elegance."
2994,412-126975-0092.flac," why is he so wild?"" he is harlequin to your columbine said, crook. i am only the clown who makes the old jokes. i wish you were the harlequin."
2995,412-126975-0033.flac," were unwrapped one by one. till they revealed something, they revealed something, they revealed something resembling the human form. the form of a friendly, but foreign-looking old gentleman, with a gray goat-like beard and a beaming smile."
2996,412-126975-0048.flac," grout the man in the red tie. i shouldn't blame him if they had taken him. when they ask for bread, and you don't even give him a stone, i think they might take the stone for themselves."
2997,412-126975-0032.flac," and began to unpack him, him, him, like some very carefully protected parcel. rugs enough to stock up a- stock up a-jar, furs of all the beasts of the forest, and scarves of all the colors of the rainbow,"
2998,412-126975-0000.flac," the flying stars. the most beautiful crime i ever committed, flambeau would say, in his highly moral old age."
2999,412-126975-0015.flac," on one side of the house stood the stable. on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind. the young lady, having scattered bread for the birds,"
3000,412-126975-0075.flac," haven't killed a policeman lately. blount frowned thoughtfully a space, and then smote his thigh. yes, we can, he cried. i've got florian's address here."
3001,412-126975-0077.flac," almost dancing. i'll be columbine, and you shall be pantalune."" the millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heath and solemnity. i think, my dear, he said."
3002,412-126975-0080.flac," he's a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes. i can be harley-kin. that only wants long legs and jumping about. my friend florian phones, he's bringing the police costume. he's changing on the way."
3003,412-126975-0065.flac," don't let's quarrel. there are. don't let's quarrel. there are. don't let's quarrel. there are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat. dislike-pat. dislike of the red-red-red-tied youth, born of his predatory opinions and evident intimacy with the pretty godchild,"
3004,412-126975-0086.flac," that strangely resembled the large lampshade in the drawing room. the clown and pantaloon made themselves white with flour from the cook, and red with rouge from some other domestic, who remained."
3005,412-126975-0017.flac," here, she gave an exclamation of wonder, real or ritual, and looking up at the high garden wall above her, beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure."
3006,412-126975-0036.flac," or pasha's in egypt. with him was his brother-in-law, lately come from canada or nga, lately come from canada, lately come from canada, a big and rather boisterous young gentleman farmer with a yellow beard, by name james blount."
3007,412-126975-0016.flac," for the fourth or fifth time that day, because the dog ate it. past unobtrusively down the lane of laurels, and into a glittering plantation of ever-greens behind."
3008,412-126975-0022.flac," he said, plasedly. and i said, plasedly. and i have no doubt i should have been, if i hadn't happened to be born in that nice house next door. i can't see any harm in it anyhow."
3009,412-126975-0090.flac," he put a paper donkeys head unexpectedly, donkeys head unexpectedly, donkeys head unexpectedly on father brown, who bore it patiently, and even found some private, private, private manner of moving his ears. he even assayed to put the paper donkeys tail"
3010,412-126975-0055.flac," oh, splendid, cried ruby. oh, i wish you'd do it to this company. the boisterous canadian, mr. blount, was lifting his loud voice and applause."
3011,412-126975-0083.flac, halfway between the front door and the staircase to mark the line of the footlights. how even such a banquet of bosch was got ready in the time remained a riddle.
3012,412-126975-0076.flac," and he knows every costumeier in london. i'll phone him to bring a police dress when he comes, and he went bounding away to the telephone. oh, it's glorious, godfather!"
3013,412-126975-0058.flac," he was dusty looking and in afraid coat, evidently a common messenger. and if you gentlemen mr. blount, he asked, and held forward a letter doubtfully."
3014,412-126975-0088.flac," prevented from smashing the old victorian luster chandeliers that he might cover himself with resplendent crystals. in fact he would certainly have done so, had not ruby unearthed some old pantomime-paced jewels."
3015,3699-47246-0020.flac," and give him at least a sort of cousinship to the quarter's sessions. all this, which was the simple truth, would have seemed extremely flat to the god gossips of milby, who had made up their minds to something much more exciting."
3016,3699-47246-0024.flac," why, it must by in the possession of some vices, possession of some vices, or possession of some vices from which they were undeniably free. hence it came to pass that milby's respectability refused to recognize the countess cherlaski."
3017,3699-47246-0017.flac," one of these conclusions was that there were things more solid in life than fine whiskers and title, and that in accepting a second husband,"
3018,3699-47246-0026.flac, so she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighborhood where people are well acquainted with each other's private affairs.
3019,3699-47246-0021.flac," there was nothing here so very detestable. it is true the countess was a little vain, a little ambitious, a little selfish, a little shallow and frivolous, a little given to white lies. but…"
3020,3699-47246-0019.flac," so she had determined on trying a neighborhood where people were extremely well acquainted with each other's affairs, and where the women were mostly ill-dressed and ugly."
3021,3699-47246-0023.flac," the severest ladies in milby would have, this have been perfectly aware that these characteristics would have created no-wide distinction, the shun, the shun between the countess cherlaski and themselves. and since it was clear there was a wide distinction."
3022,3699-47246-0022.flac," who considers such slight blemishes such moral pimples as these, disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society. indeed,"
3023,3699-47246-0016.flac," not indeed any very ripe, the ripe, ripe, and comprehensive wisdom, but much external polish, and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind."
3024,3699-47246-0030.flac," for—for—you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the countess was absorbingly devoted, and to whose desires—f desires—desires she made everything else—subserving—namely, caroline cherlaski, nay, bridmain."
3025,3699-47246-0025.flac," in spite of her as sidhuya's church going, and the deep disgust she was known to have expressed, at the extreme posity of the congregations on ash wednesdays."
3026,3699-47246-0015.flac," whom he initiated into the mysteries of the paddeba and the lances quadrioles. she had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with chalaski, who had taken her to paris and germany."
3027,3699-47246-0018.flac," was difficult to be met with at watering places, which were already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauties, and were chiefly stocked with men whose whiskers might be dyed, and whose incomes were still more problematic."
3028,3699-47246-0027.flac," and shun a coldly and satirical eye as she was shun a gorgon, and a gorgon, and a gorgon. and she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship, not merely because that is quite and the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society."
3029,3699-47246-0031.flac," thus, there was really not much, really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and attentions to mr. and mrs. barton."
3030,3699-47246-0012.flac," of the smallest description, indeed, he would not have ventured to call it his own. he might be slightly recalcitrant now and then, as is the habit of long-eared packy-derms under the thong of the fair countess's tongue,"
3031,3699-47246-0011.flac," every man who is not a monster, a mathematician, or a mad philosopher is the slave of some woman or other, mr. bridman had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister, and though his soul was a very little one."
3032,3699-47246-0028.flac," and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that, that, that quarter. she had serious intentions of becoming quite pious without any reserves, when she had once, at once, got her carriage and settlement."
3033,3699-47246-0032.flac," still, their friendship, by no means adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to milby, and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother."
3034,3699-47246-0013.flac," and there was always the possibility that mr. bridmanes, first nupials, might occur before the countess was quite sure of her second. as it was, however, he submitted to all, for he submitted to all, for he submitted to all his sister's caprices,"
3035,3699-47246-0014.flac, as personages on the debatable ground between aristocracy and commonality. instead of settling in some spot where his 500 a year might have won him the definite dignity of a parochial magnate.
3036,3699-47246-0029.flac," the countess did not quote sophocles, but she said, she said to herself, only this little bit of bit of pretense and vanity, and then i will be quite good and make myself quite safe for another world."
3037,3699-47246-0004.flac," had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the other ladies manifest superiority in personal charms. miss fipps, stumpy figure, and unsuccessful attire"
3038,3699-47246-0005.flac," instead of looking down from a mount of virtue with an oriol around its head, would then be seen on the same level and in the same light as the countess chalazki's diana-like form and well-chosen drapery."
3039,3699-47246-0006.flac," miss fipps, for her part, didn't like dressing for effect. she had always avoided that style of appearance which was calculated to create a sensation."
3040,3699-47246-0003.flac," and which would be utterly overturned and nullified, nullified, and nullified by the destruction of that premise. mrs. fipps, the banker's wife and mrs. lander, the attorney's wife, had invested part of their reputation for acuteness,"
3041,3699-47246-0001.flac," nice distinctions are troublesome. it is so much easier to say that a thing is black than to discriminate the particular shade of brown, blue, or green to which it really belongs."
3042,3699-47246-0009.flac," had won a partnership in a silk manufacturing factory, and thereby a moderate fortune that enabled him to retire as a study politics, the weather and the art of conversation at his leisure."
3043,3699-47246-0000.flac, chapter 4
3044,3699-47246-0010.flac," mr. bridman, in fact, quadrigenery and bachelor as he was, felt extremely well pleased to receive his sister in her widowhood and to shine in the reflected light of her beauty and title."
3045,3699-47246-0002.flac," besides, think of all the virtuous declamation, all virtuous declamation, all the penetrating observation, which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position that the countess was a very objectionable person indeed."
3046,3699-47246-0007.flac," then, what amusing innuendos of the milby gentlemen, gentlemen over their wine would have been entirely frustrated and reduced to not if you had told them that the countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanors, which demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society."
3047,3699-47246-0008.flac," had subsequently given dancing lessons in the metropolis. that mr. bridman was neither more nor less than her half-brother, who by unimpeached integrity and industry."
3048,3699-19402-0022.flac," but not vapor, vaporingly, and with the sweetest accent of most respectful and respectful encouragement, bid his honor never fear. now my uncle toby did fear, and grievously too."
3049,3699-19402-0006.flac," my mother, madame, was so at no time, either by nature, nature by institution or example. a temperate, current, current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of the year."
3050,3699-19402-0013.flac," to have cost her ladieship a smile. it curled everywhere but where the corporal would have it, and where a buckle, a buckle, or two in his opinion would have done it on her, he could as soon have raised the dead."
3051,3699-19402-0003.flac," whether it was a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession. my father, who was all sensibilities from head to foot,"
3052,3699-19402-0009.flac," and here am i, sitting, this twelfth day of august, 1766, in a purple jirkin and a yellow, oak, oak, oak pair of slippers, without either wig or cap on, a most tragic comical completion of his prediction."
3053,3699-19402-0010.flac," for certainly, keyholes were made for other purposes, and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a keyhole to be what it was,"
3054,3699-19402-0030.flac," a thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have said more for salibacy. my uncle, uncle toby looked earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling, his bowling, his bowling green."
3055,3699-19402-0021.flac," my uncle toby turned his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal, and the corporal, as often as he did it, gave a slight flourish with his stick."
3056,3699-19402-0016.flac," in a period of 15 or 16 years since they had been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle toby's life, for he seldom went further than the bowling green."
3057,3699-19402-0025.flac," she cannot, quote my uncle toby halting when they had marched up to within twenty paces of mrs. wadman's door. she cannot corporal take it a miss."
3058,3699-19402-0023.flac," infinite was his pity, nor would the most courteous night of romance have gone further, at least upon one leg, to have wiped away a tear from a woman's eye."
3059,3699-19402-0000.flac," could have vented to such an insinuation. he was, however, frank and generous in his nature, and at all times open to conviction, so that he had scarce got to the last word—the last word—the last word of this ungracious retort."
3060,3699-19402-0008.flac," that was the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head. nature had done her part to have spared him this trust, trust, that trouble, and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it."
3061,3699-19402-0020.flac," like a pike. it looks swell, at least, quote my father to himself."
3062,3699-19402-0017.flac," and, to shorten all description, they shone so bright against, against, against the sun that morning, and had so metallic, so metallic and dirty and air with them, that had, had, had, had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armor, nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination."
3063,3699-19402-0024.flac," and yet, accepting once that he was beguiled into it by mrs. wadman, he had never looked steadfastly into one, and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart."
3064,3699-19402-0005.flac," a thin blue chill, perlucid crystal with all its humors so at rest, the least moat or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of it had it existed."
3065,3699-19402-0028.flac," when once a poor creature is he was in, he is in and pleased your honor forever. ""'tis very true,' said my uncle toby, looking gravely at mrs. wadman's house as he spoke. nothing"
3066,3699-19402-0019.flac," a whiff of military pride had puffed out his shirt at the wrist, and upon that, in a black leather thong, clipped into a tassel beyond the knot, hung the corporal's stick. my uncle toby carried his cane."
3067,3699-19402-0011.flac," it became a violation of nature, and it violation of nature, and was so far, you see, criminal. it is for this reason, and please you—it is reason, and please your references—that key holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes."
3068,3699-19402-0007.flac," which, having little or no meaning in them, nature is oftentimes obliged to find one. and as for my father's example, to a so far from being either aiding or a betting, whether aiding or a betting thereon to,"
3069,3699-19402-0002.flac," she raised her fingers and let them fall. it could scarce be called a tap, or if it was a tap,"
3070,3699-19402-0001.flac," when his conscience smote him. my mother was then conjugal swinging with her left arm twisted under his right, in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his."
3071,3699-19402-0014.flac," such it was, or rather, such would it have seemed upon any other brow, but the sweet look of goodness, which sat upon my uncle toby's, assimilated everything around it so sovereignly to itself."
3072,3699-19402-0018.flac," and with his hair tucked up, up, up under his monteiro cap, which he had furbished up for the occasion."
3073,3699-19402-0029.flac," said by uncle toby, musing, see musing, see musing. whilst a man is free, cried the corporal, giving off luresh with his stick thus."
3074,3699-19402-0026.flac," your honor replied the corporal, no's of tom's misfortunes, but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this."
3075,3699-19402-0004.flac," conscience redoubled. conscience redoubled. conscience redoubled her blow. he turned his face suddenly the other way, and, and, and, and my mother, supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move onwards, by a cross-movement of her right leg."
3076,3699-19402-0015.flac, and nature had moreover wrote gentlemen with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance that even his tarnished gold-laced hat and gold-laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him.
3077,3699-19402-0027.flac," that if tom had not married the widow, or had its pleased god after their marriage, that they had but put pork into their sausages, the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed and dragged to the inquisition."
3078,3699-19402-0012.flac," though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my— his word in putting my uncle toby's great romali wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it. it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk."
3079,3699-19401-0006.flac, for this reason continued my father stating the case over again. notwithstanding all the world knows that mrs. wattman affects my brother toby and my brother toby contrary wise affects mrs. wattman.
3080,3699-19401-0001.flac," for that the tailor in ripping, in ripping them up in order to turn them, had found that they had been turned before. then turn them again, brother, said my father rapidly, for there will be many a turning of them yet before all is done in the affair."
3081,3699-19401-0002.flac," they are as rotten as dirt,"" said the corporal. then by all means said my father, be speak a new pair, brother, for though i know continued my father turning himself to the company,"
3082,3699-19401-0015.flac," mrs. shandy being now close beside me preparing for bed. i have thrown together without order and just as they have come into my mind, such hints and documents as i deem maybe of use to thee."
3083,3699-19401-0019.flac," once at least every four or five days, but often are if convenient, less than taking off thy wig before her through absence of mind, she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by time, how much by trim."
3084,3699-19401-0003.flac," that widowodman has been deeply in love with my brother toby for many years, and has used every art and circumvention of one woman to outwit him into the same passion. yet now, though that she has caught him, her fever will be passed its height."
3085,3699-19401-0007.flac," and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night, yet will i answer for it that this self-same tune will not be played this 12 month."
3086,3699-19401-0018.flac," without first recommending thyself to the protection of all my—with protection of all my protection of almighty god—that he may defend thee from the evil one. shave the whole top of thy crown, clean!"
3087,3699-19401-0021.flac," for this cause, if thou canst, thou canst help it, never throw down the tongues into poker. avoid all couple, couple, couple kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her."
3088,3699-19401-0025.flac," there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning, so accordingly it was resolved upon for 11 o'clock."
3089,3699-19401-0022.flac," they are all books which excite laughter, and thou knowest dear toby that there is no passion so serious as lust. stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou interest her parlor."
3090,3699-19401-0014.flac," and perhaps it is as well for thee, though not so well for me, that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head, and that i am able to write it to thee. had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots,"
3091,3699-19401-0026.flac," but the account of this is worth more than to be woven into the fag end of the eighth, alluding to the first edition, volume of such a work as this."
3092,3699-19401-0004.flac," into a core, no matter whether he loves the service or no. being once in it, he acts as if he did and takes every step to show himself a man of prowess."
3093,3699-19401-0008.flac," we have taken our measures badly. in our measures badly, quote my uncle toby, looking up interrogatively in trim's face. i would leave my montero camp, said trim."
3094,3699-19401-0000.flac," my father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a flashing way with him in his disputations, thrusting and ripping and giving everyone a stroke to remember him by in his turn."
3095,3699-19401-0013.flac," and my father, taking that very crisis to fall in helter's skelter, and his skelter upon the whole order of nuns, and nuns, and nuns, and begines, a set of silly, fusty baggages, slop, kudnuts, and kudnuts, and kudnuts, and kudnuts, stand it. and my uncle toby, having some measures to take about his breaches,"
3096,3699-19401-0020.flac," whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to utter it in a low, soft tone of voice. silence and whatever approaches it, weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain."
3097,3699-19401-0009.flac," now, trim's montero cap, as i once told you, was his constant wager, and having furbished it up that very night in order to go upon the attack, it made the odds look more considerable."
3098,3699-19401-0011.flac," that widow-wadman and pleaser worship cannot hold it out ten days. and whence, cried slop, jeeringly, has thou all this knowledge of woman, friend?"
3099,3699-19401-0016.flac," though i perceive, i perceive from a glow in my cheek the thai blushes i begin to speak to the upon the subject, as well knowing, the subject, as well knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of its offices thou neglectest."
3100,3699-19401-0010.flac," i would lay and please your honor my montero cap to a shilling, was it proper, continued trim, making a bow, to offer a wager before your honors? there is nothing improper in it,"" said my father."

3488,2989-138028-0014.flac, i would inflict a chastisement upon me for the blasphemy that has uttered that all the world should ring with. what can it be the young hussie that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticize the histories of knight's errant?

3513,2989-138028-0001.flac," but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. nevertheless, among many other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to him, in truth master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home,"
3514,2952-408-0029.flac," help me by your prayers, i entreat you, so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible, terrible, terrible state of existence. no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared. and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant."
3515,2952-408-0025.flac," you need not be ashamed for having refused me, shelter,"" said musso. you directed me to the village, john, where i was very kindly treated, and i thank you for that favor. i can give no mad shelter. the recluse made answer."
3516,2952-408-0024.flac," and this time, its aged occupant invited him to enter. when he had done so, the hermit humbly bowed down before him, exclaiming, ah, i am ashamed, i am very much ashamed, i am exceedingly ashamed."
3517,2952-408-0028.flac," since then, i have been no obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district. every one of them, every one of them, i must devour in the way that you saw last night. now reverence, sir."
3518,2952-408-0023.flac," for it was evident that his kind host, supposed him, for host, supposed him, for host, supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin. but after having bitten them farewell and obtained all necessary, for necessary information as to his road, he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill, and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived."
3519,2952-408-0022.flac," and after a moment of silence the master of the house said, reverend sir, there is no priest and there is no angitsu on the hill. for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood. muso said nothing more on the subject."
3520,2952-408-0026.flac," so, in that time, the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here. sometimes from great distances, in order that i might repeat over them the holy service. but i repeated the service and performed the rights only as a matter of business."
3521,2952-408-0021.flac," the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this, this, this, this village, answered musso. i called that, that, that is anjitsu on the hill yonder. he refused, refused, refused me lodging, but told me the way here. the listeners looked at each other as an astonishment."
3522,2952-408-0020.flac," what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said, what has been said, and said about this matter from ancient time. musso then inquired, does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for you, warm the funeral service for your dead? what priest, the young man asked?"
3523,2952-408-0027.flac," i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain, and because of the selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki."
3524,2952-408-0004.flac," but little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of, sleep by a sound of, sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment. presently, apartment. presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man, carrying a lighted lantern, entered the room respectfully saluted him and said,"
3525,2952-408-0005.flac, the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village.
3526,2952-408-0011.flac," all then left the house, except the priest, who went to the room where the dead body was lying. the usual offerings had been set before the corpse, and a small buddhist lamp, comeo, was burning."
3527,2952-408-0019.flac," then musso told of dim and awful shape that it entered the death chamber to devour the body and the body and the offerings. no person seemed to be surprised by his narration, and the master of the house observed."
3528,2952-408-0013.flac," but when the hush of the night night was at its deepest, their noiselessly entered a shape. veg and a shape. veg and a shape. veg and vast, and in the same moment musso found himself without power to move or speak."
3529,2952-408-0018.flac," and to leave the corpse alone. whenever this law has been broken here to four, some great misfortune has followed. whenever it is as obeyed, we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence. perhaps you have seen the cause."
3530,2952-408-0012.flac," the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies, after which he entered into meditation. so meditating he remained, through several silent hours, and there was no sound in the deserted village."
3531,2952-408-0015.flac," turned to the offerings and ate them also. then it went away as mysteriously as it had come. when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling, all in turn saluted him, and when they had entered."
3532,2952-408-0009.flac," then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the joining room, having been told of the priests' kind promises, then priests' kind promises, came to thank him. after which the master, the master, the master of the house said, now reverence, sir, much as we regret to leave you alone, we must bid you farewell."
3533,2952-408-0016.flac," and looked about the room, no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings. but the master of the house said to musso, wherever in sur you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night."
3534,2952-408-0006.flac," strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has been left. so we think, think, think, think that it will be better for you to come away with us. we can find you good lodging in the other village."
3535,2952-408-0008.flac," as it is, i shall perform the service after you have gone away, and i shall stay by the body until morning. i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone."
3536,2952-408-0000.flac," chickeningki. once, once, once, once, when musou kokushi."
3537,2952-408-0017.flac," all of us were anxious about you, but now we are very happy to- all of you are very happy to find you alive and unharmed. gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible, but the law of our village, as i told you, all of you, all of you last evening, oblige us to quit our houses after a death has taken place."
3538,2952-408-0007.flac," but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death, of your father's death, of your father's death when i came. for though i was a little tired, i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest. had you told me, i could have performed the service before your departure."
3539,2952-408-0010.flac," by the rule of our village, none of us can stay here after midnight. we beg, kind sir, that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are enabled to attend upon you. and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence, please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning."
3540,2952-408-0001.flac," for a long time he wandered about helplessly, and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night, when he perceived on the top of the top of a hill, lighted by the last rays of the sun, one of those little hermitages called"
3541,2952-408-0014.flac," he saw that shape lift the corpse, as with hands. devour it, more quickly than a cat devours a rat, beginning at the head and eating everything, the hair and the bones, and even the shroud. shroud. the monstrous thing, having thus consumed the body."
3542,2952-408-0003.flac," this the old man harshly refused, but he directed musso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining, where lodging and food could be obtained. musso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages."
3543,2952-408-0002.flac," which are built for solitary priests. it seemed to be enruonous, which would be enruonous condition. but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest, from whom he begged the favor of a knight's lodging."
3544,2952-410-0028.flac," gently unbarring the door, he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it. he heard voices, talking in the grove, and he went in the direction of the voices, stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place."
3545,2952-410-0036.flac," but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree, and with that tree he struck the heads as they came, knocking them from him with tremendous blows. four of them fled away, but the head of the aruji, though battered again and again desperately, continued to bound the priest."
3546,2952-410-0052.flac," at the mention of that name, at name a murmur of admiration filled the courtroom, for there were many present who remembered it, and quite immediately found himself among friends instead of judges. friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness."
3547,2952-410-0010.flac," and i must assure you, sir, that it is very dangerous to sleep here. therefore, although my house is only a wretched, thatched hut, let me beg of you, happy, happy, happy to come home with me at once. in the way of food, i have nothing to offer you, but there is a roof at least, and you can sleep under it without risk."
3548,2952-410-0033.flac," he has taken the body of araruji, and i do not—he is not nowhere, he has put it. at this announcement, the head of the aruji, distinctly visible in the moonlight, assumed a frightful aspect. its eyes opened monstrously, its hair stood up, bristling at its teeth, gnashed."
3549,2952-410-0000.flac, all the capacities of a daring and skillful soldier.
3550,2952-410-0032.flac," another head, the head of a young woman, immediately rose up and flitted to the house lightly as a bat. after a few minutes it came back, a few minutes it came back, and cried out huskily, and doubt huskily in the tone of great alarm, that traveling priest is not in the house! he is gone, but that is not the worst of the matter."
3551,2952-410-0060.flac," and he could not discover the body. therefore he buried the head by itself in the grove behind the cottage, and he had a tombstone set up over the grave, and he caused a sechaki, he caused a sechaki service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the rokoro kubi."
3552,2952-410-0019.flac," in the holy sutras, it is written that those strongest and wrongdoing can become by power of good resolve, the strongest and rightdoing, in doing, in doing. i do not doubt that you have a good heart, and i hope that better fortune will help that better fortune will come to you."
3553,2952-410-0011.flac," accepted this modest offer. the woodcutter guided him along a narrow path, leading up from the main road through mountain for it, a mountain for it, a mountain for it. it was a rough and dangerous path, sometimes scurting precipices, sometimes scurting precipices, and sometimes scurting precipices, sometimes offering nothing but a network of"
3554,2952-410-0030.flac," presently the head of the arugis stopped eating, and said, ah, that traveling priest who came tonight, how fat all his body is. when we shall have eaten him, we shall have eaten him, our bellies will be well filled. i was foolish to talk to him, as i did."
3555,2952-410-0001.flac," but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone, and as his heart remained true to his former lord, he preferred to give up the world. so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest, taking the buddhist name of quaidou."
3556,2952-410-0023.flac," and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night. quirio felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house, he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household."
3557,2952-410-0018.flac," quirio was pleased by this announcement of good resolve, and he said to the arugie, my friend, i have had occasion to observe that man prone to folly in their youth, may and after years become very earnest in right living."
3558,2952-410-0015.flac," though now living as you find me, i was once a person of some distinction. my story, though no story is the story of a ruined life, ruined by my own fault. i used to be in the service of a dimeo, and my rank in that service was not inconsiderable."
3559,2952-410-0024.flac," very gently he pushed apart the sliding screens that separated his room from the main apartment, and he saw, by the light of the lantern, five recumbent bodies, without heads."
3560,2952-410-0027.flac," and presently die. now, if these be rokurokubi, they mean me no good, so i shall be justified in following the instructions of the book. he sees the body of the aruchi by the feet, pulled it to the window, and pushed it out."
3561,2952-410-0029.flac," then from behind a trunk he caught sight of the heads. all five of them, flitting about, chatting as they fl-out, chatting as they flitted. they were eating worms and insects, which they found on the ground, or among the trees."
3562,2952-410-0055.flac," though brave the highwomen was startled, he dropped the garment and sprang, and sprang, and sprang back, then he cried out, you!"
3563,2952-410-0002.flac," as in other years, he had left peril, so now also he scorned danger."
3564,2952-410-0009.flac," to lie down here. this place has a bad name, but as the proverb has it, kunshi tti a yukini chika yorasu. the superior man does not needlessly expose himself to peril."
3565,2952-410-0008.flac," as for loans from places i like them, they are suitable for meditation. i am accustomed to sleeping in the open air, and i have learned, and i have learned, and i have learned never to be anxious about my life."
3566,2952-410-0041.flac," after which he gathered together his few belongings and leisurely belongings and leisurely belongings and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey. right on, he churned until he came to suwa."
3567,2952-410-0020.flac," tonight i shall recite the sutras for your sake, and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors. with these assurances, queryo bade the aruchi goodnight, and his host showed him to a very small side room where a bed had been made ready."
3568,2952-410-0022.flac, the night was beautiful. there was no cloud in the sky. there was no wind. and the strong moonlight through the strong moonlight through down sharp black shadows of foliage and glittered on the dews of the garden.
3569,2952-410-0013.flac," and they must have been taught by someone well acquainted with the rules of propriety, then turning to his host, the aoruchi, or housemaster, as the others called him, kwairo said."
3570,2952-410-0004.flac," he had always welcomed discomfort, and even a bear-bear-bear-bear-rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found, and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow. his body was iron, and he never troubled himself about dues or rain or frost or snow."
3571,2952-410-0026.flac," and remove the body to another place, the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck. and the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved, it will strike itself upon the floor three times, bouncing like a ball, and bullpant is in great fear."
3572,2952-410-0050.flac, perhaps she wants belonged to the samurai class.
3573,2952-410-0049.flac," there are the other characters. you can see for yourselves that they have not been painted. moreover it is well known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the province of cai from very ancient time, but you, sir, he exclaimed turning to quirio."
3574,2952-410-0025.flac," for one instant he stood bewildered, imagining a crime, but in another crime, but in another moment he perceived that there was no blood, and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut. then he thought to himself."
3575,2952-410-0016.flac," but i loved women and wine too well, and under the—but i didn't too well, and under the influence of passion i acted wickedly."
3576,2952-410-0051.flac," before becoming a priest, i longed to be a long fall of the profession of arms, and in those days i never feared men or devil. my name then was isogai hitazai-mo taketsura of kyushu. there may be some among you who remember it."
3577,2952-410-0044.flac," quite your left-long and loudly at these questions, and then he said, sir, as i did not fasten the head to my sleeve, it fastened itself there, much against my will, and i have not committed any crime, for this is not the head of a man, it is the head of a goblet."
3578,2952-410-0045.flac," but the magistrates did not laugh. they judged him to be a hardened criminal and historian insult to their intelligence. therefore, without further questioning, they decided to order as immediate execution. all of them except one."
3579,2952-410-0057.flac," what a nice priest you are! bar exclaim the robber, you killed men and just about it! but i am really an earnest, here an earnest, here is my robe, and here is the money, and let me have the head. what is the use of joking?"
3580,2952-410-0046.flac," a very old, old man. this aged officer had made no remark during the trial, but after having heard the opinion of his colleagues, he rose up and said, let us first examine the head carefully. for this i think has not yet been done."
3581,2952-410-0006.flac," and after a moment of silent observation said to him an atone of—and an atone of—atone of great surprise, what kind of man can you be, good, sir, that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this? there are haunters about here. many of them. are you not afraid of hairy things?"
3582,2952-410-0005.flac," scarsely, he laneed down when a man came along the road carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood. this woodcutter halted on seeing quieter, lying down."
3583,2952-410-0035.flac," and there he is, behind that tree, hiding behind that tree, see him, the fat coward. in the same moment, the head of the arushi, followed by the other four heads, sprang at quirio."
3584,2952-410-0054.flac," a day or two, after leaving sua, quirio met with a robber who stopped him in a lonesome place and bait him strip. quirio at once removed his koromo, and offered it to the robber, who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve."
3585,2952-410-0014.flac," from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household, i imagine that you have not always been a woodcutter. perhaps you formally belong to one of the upper classes. smiling, the woodcutter answered, sir, you are not mistaken."
3586,2952-410-0047.flac," the old man turned it round and round, carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters. he called the attention of his colleagues to these, and also made them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon."
3587,2952-410-0007.flac," my friend, cheerfully answered quiro, i am only a wandering priest, a cloud and water guest, as folks call it."
3588,2952-410-0003.flac," so he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars, and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside, he lay down there, sumped up there, and prepared to sleep."
3589,2952-410-0038.flac," but its teeth still held the sleeve, and for all his great strength, quiderio could not force open the jaws. with the head still, the head still, the head still hanging to his sleeve, he went back to the house, and there caught sight of the other four rokurokube squatting together."
3590,2952-410-0058.flac," take the thing,"" said quaidio. i was not joking."
3591,2952-410-0021.flac, then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sutras by the light of a paper lantern. until a late hour he continued to read and pray.
3592,2952-410-0034.flac," since my body has been moved to rejoin it is not possible, then i must die. and all through the work of that priest."
3593,2952-410-0017.flac," retribution followed me, and retribution followed me, and i long remained effugitive in the land. now i often pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did, and to reestablish the ancestral home, but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing."
3594,2952-410-0059.flac," and he then became afraid that the spirit of the rokura kubi might give him trouble. so he made up his mind to take back the head, to the place from which it had come, and to bury it with its body. he found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of kai, but nobody was there."
3595,2952-410-0012.flac," slippery roots for the foot to rest upon, sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock. but at last, quidero found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead, and he saw before him a small, fatched cottage."
3596,2952-410-0039.flac," with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies. but when they perceived him at the back door, all screamed, the priest, the priest, and fled through the other door, with the other doorway out into the woods. eastward, the sky was brightening. day was about to dawn."
3597,2952-410-0053.flac," when quaidur left sua, he was his hap-su-a. he was his hap-su-a. he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world. as for the head, he took it with him, jocosly insisting that he intended it for a miyage, and now it only remains to tell what became of the head."
3598,2952-410-0048.flac," on the contrary, the line of leverns was smooth, as the line at which a falling leaf leaf detaches itself from the s-self, from the s-self, from the stem. then said the elder, i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth. this is the head of a ro-koro-gubi."
3599,2952-410-0037.flac," and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe, quaiuio, and quaiuio, and quaiuio, however, as quickly gripped the head by its top knot and repeatedly struck it. it did not release its hold, but uttered a long, and it pulled, but uttered a long moan, and thereafter ceased to struggle. it was dead."
3600,2952-410-0031.flac," to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult, and we could be difficult, and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying, but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep, some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing."
3601,2952-410-0040.flac," and quirio knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness. he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all fouled with blood and foam and clay, and he left aloud as he thought to himself."
3602,2952-410-0042.flac," seized the priest and took him to jail, for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man, who in the moment being killed had caught the murder of murderers' sleep in his teeth. as the quarry he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him."
3603,2952-410-0043.flac," so, after having passed a knight in prison, he was brought before the magistrates of the district district. then he was ordered to explain how he, a priest, had been found with the head of a man, fastened to his sleeve, and why he had dared, dared, dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people."
3604,2952-410-0056.flac," quite a answer. i shall let you have the head and the rope if you insist, but i must tell you that this is not the head of a man. it is a goblin's head. so if you buy it and have any trouble and consequence, please to remember that you were not sieved by me."
3605,2952-407-0010.flac," or bell of mugen. now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation, implied though not described by the verb."
3606,2952-407-0005.flac," evidently, the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving. she had not presented her all-brothering with all her heart, and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to the mirror, kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace."
3607,2952-407-0024.flac," if by striking upon the wash basin of umagai, i could make honorable money come to me."
3608,2952-407-0008.flac," but the bell proved proved proved to be a good bell, and it bravely withstood their assaults. nevertheless, the people were not easily discouraged, but the deasily discouraged. day after day, at all hours, they continued to ring the bell, but bell furiously, carrying nothing whatever for the protests of the priests."
3609,2952-407-0006.flac," of course, everybody heard of the matter, and everybody soon knew, knew, knew whose mirror it was that would not melt. and because of this public exposure of her secret fault, the poor, poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry. and as she could not bear the shame, she drowned herself."
3610,2952-407-0015.flac," so much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazura-e-ru. the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples, but for present purposes the following will serve. if you should make a little man of straw,"
3611,2952-407-0012.flac," to compare, to liken, but the s- to ks- the s- or t- meaning is to substitute an imagination, one object or action for another, so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result."
3612,2952-407-0022.flac, crying out at the same time for 300 pieces of gold. a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping.
3613,2952-407-0001.flac," who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for bell metal. but afterwards, she much regretted her mirror. she remembered things that her mother had told her about it, and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her, but to her mother, but to her mother's mother and grandmother, and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected."
3614,2952-407-0007.flac," after having written a farewell letter containing these words. when i am, i am dead. it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell. but to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it, great wealth will be given by the ghost of me."
3615,2952-407-0023.flac," afterwards, a song was made about umega's basin of bronze, and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this stay. umega in no chose wachitata itte."
3616,2952-407-0002.flac," but she had not the money necessary. whenever she went to the temple, she saw her mirror lying in the courtyard, behind a railing, among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together. she knew it by the shochiko bay in relief on the back of it, those three fortunate, fortunate, fortunate, fortunate emblems of pine, bamboo and plum flower."
3617,2952-407-0009.flac," so the ringing became an affliction, and the priests could not endure it, and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp. the swamp was deep and swallowed it up, and that was the end of the bell."
3618,2952-407-0011.flac," the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word, for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic, as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith."
3619,2952-407-0018.flac," the souls of the defeat of the robber will become inflamed, and will allow him no rest, until he returns of his own accord to put himself, the sings of himself at your mercy. that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazura-yudu."
3620,2952-407-0016.flac," for the same reason that sister helen made it a little man of wax, and nail it."
3621,2952-407-0019.flac," after the bell had been rolled into the swamp, there was no more chance of ringing it in such wisest to break it."
3622,2952-407-0003.flac," which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror. she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and which, and which, and heighted, that she might thereafter treasure it always, but the chance did not come, and she became very unhappy, felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life."
3623,2952-407-0017.flac," that would still illustrate one signification of nazora-rydu, or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables. if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them."
3624,2952-407-0020.flac," but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and book and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell, thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble. one of these persons was a woman called umegai."
3625,2952-407-0027.flac," and they opened it together, and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with"
3626,2952-407-0026.flac," as it deserves to be, as it be answered, take therefore this jar."" so saying she put the jar into his hand, as it was hands and disappeared. into his house the happy man rushed to tell his wife the good news. he sat down in front of her, the covered jar, which was heavy."
3627,2952-407-0013.flac," for example, you cannot afford to build a buddhist temple, but temple, but temple, but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha, with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one. the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple."
3628,2952-407-0025.flac," became great, and many people followed the example of umega, thereby hoping to emulate her luck."
3629,2952-407-0014.flac," you cannot read the 6,771 volumes of the buddhist texts, but you can make a revolving library containing them, turn round, by pushing it like a windlass."
3630,2952-407-0021.flac," while the pair were traveling together, kazuharu one day found himself in great straits for want of money, and dumegai, remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen, took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it."
3631,2952-407-0004.flac," a saying mystically expressed by the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors. and she feared the mirrors, and she feared the mirrors, and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined. but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody."
3632,2952-407-0000.flac," even today in the courts of certain japanese temples, you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose. the largest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the jodo sect at hakata in kyushu."
3633,2836-5355-0001.flac," she pursued, bending her eyes, determinedly upon him. it must be with all my heart rejoins her francis. it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind."
3634,2836-5355-0019.flac," quite true was her reply. and i believe you were on the wrong set, isabelle. if it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it, since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse, it is of no consequence to smooth over facts."
3635,2836-5355-0024.flac," and carlisle was acting in it under the rose for mrs. hea. she could not seek out carlisle herself, so she sent the young lady. that's all i know. how did you know it? i had reason to think so."
3636,2836-5355-0047.flac," and calling the servants and before him, there were but two, gave them each a year's wages in advance."
3637,2836-5355-0028.flac," was her icy answer. let's see, was her icy answer. let's see, how old is he now? he was born on the last day of august. sir francis was francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idol in the sito was a sitover taking him then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes."
3638,2836-5355-0022.flac," her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone. her face was more flush than it had been throughout the interview. he spoke quietly now, quite in an equal tone of reasoning. it was his way when the ill-temper was upon him."
3639,2836-5355-0048.flac," then he paid a visit to the landlord, the landlord, and handed him likewise a year's rent in advance, making the same remark. after that, he ordered dinner at a hotel, and the same night he and pierre departed on their journey home again."
3640,2836-5355-0042.flac," don't i know it? have i not said so?"" she sharply interrupted and then she sat, striving to calm herself, clasping together her shaking hands. well, if you will persist in this perverse resolution, i cannot mend it."
3641,2836-5355-0045.flac," you will have the goodness to order pierre to take away, you'll take away, you'll take away this afternoon. and now, sir francis, i believe that is all we will part. to remain mortal enemies from henceforth is that to be it? to be strangers she replied correcting him."
3642,2836-5355-0012.flac," and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed. he did not take the trouble to look at it. i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronet see, presumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words."
3643,2836-5355-0010.flac," well, isabelle, you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman. the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks, but her voice sounded calm as before."
3644,2836-5355-0005.flac," what fancies you do take up at her france's levison? sometimes subsequent to your departure, she quietly went on. one of the maids was setting to rights, the clothes in your dressing closet, and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets."
3645,2836-5355-0018.flac," whose fits of ill-temper were under no control, and who never, when in them, cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another. the temptation to sin, as you call it, lay not in my persuasions half so much, as in your jealous anger toward your husband."
3646,2836-5355-0029.flac," who is he like, isabelle? my handsome self? isabelle? my handsome self? where he like you in spirit, i would pray that he might die, air he could speak or think. she burst forth, and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself, subsided in the"
3647,2836-5355-0004.flac, your words are not words of truth but of deceit. you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage.
3648,2836-5355-0002.flac," when you left in july, you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage. you know what i mean when i say in time, but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise. he interrupted, but no sooner had i set my foot in london."
3649,2836-5355-0030.flac," outwardly into calmness again. what else? ask again. what else? reported sir francis, you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me,"
3650,2836-5355-0052.flac," accepting that it was connected with the office and all mr. dill, and that mr. carlaw laughed when he told it. they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald, and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter, she awoke."
3651,2836-5355-0046.flac," i wish you a good day. so you will not even shake hands with me, isabelle. i would prefer not. and thus, as they parted, sir francis left the room, but not immediately the house. he went into a distant apartment"
3652,2836-5355-0051.flac," but that she seemed never to have gone away from it. walking in, but then the flower garden with mr. carly, but carly, but carly while the three children played on the lawn. her arm was within her husband's and he was relating something to her. what the news was, she could not remember afterward."
3653,2836-5355-0034.flac," i received these from you a month ago, she said, they came by post. and never had the grace to acknowledge them, he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone. 40 pounds, that was the amount, was it not? i believe so."
3654,2836-5355-0014.flac," and bring a clergyman into the room to perform this ceremony, it would and would be futile. the injury to the child can never be repaired, and for myself i cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you."
3655,2836-5355-0035.flac," allow me to return them to you. count them. return them to me for what? inquired sir francis in amazement? i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way. do not make my arm a, holding out these notes to you so long. take them."
3656,2836-5355-0053.flac," alas, it was the actual crying of her own child, which awoke her. this last, last child. the ill-fated little being in the cradle beside her."
3657,2836-5355-0007.flac," he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask. but he was an ill-tempered man, and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now. lady isabel continued."
3658,2836-5355-0036.flac," if it be, be, be your wish that all relations should in between us while let it be so. oh, oh, oh, he said, i must confess i think it may be that wise as course has things have come to this past for a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable."
3659,2836-5355-0049.flac," sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance. and lady isabel, she passed her evening alone, sitting in the same place, close to the fire and the sparks."
3660,2836-5355-0017.flac," you ladies should think of that beforehand. yes, she said, really answered, may heaven help all to do so who maybe, who maybe tempted as i was. if you mean that as a reproach to me, it's rather out of place, chafes or frances."
3661,2836-5355-0013.flac, and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay and stay interrupted lady lady lady isabel. you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses. had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife were you to propose to do so this day.
3662,2836-5355-0043.flac," resumes her, frances. in a little time, you may probably wish to recall it. in which case, a line addressed to me at my bankers will, lady isabel drew herself up. put away those notes. if you please, she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence."
3663,2836-5355-0039.flac," sarcastically rejoins her francis, generous man, a flush deep and painful died her cheeks. i should have said my late husband, you need not have reminded me of the mistake."
3664,2836-5355-0016.flac," she shook her head. all the reparation in your power to make, all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin. it and the effects must lie upon me forever. oh, sin was the derisive exclamation."
3665,2836-5355-0037.flac," remember, though, that it is you're doing not mine. but you cannot think i am going to see you star of isabelle, a sum we will fix upon the amount amicably"
3666,2836-5355-0015.flac," if you have taken this aversion to me, it cannot be helped."" he coldly said, inwardly congratulating himself, let us not doubt, doubt, doubt, at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated. you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation."
3667,2836-5355-0041.flac," whom do you take me for? what do you take me for? she repeated rising in her bitter mortification. if you have put me beyond the pale of the world, i am still lord mount severn's daughter. you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as"
3668,2836-5355-0011.flac," when i expected or wished for the sacrifice, it was not for my own sake, i told you so then, but it was not made, and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame, there he lies. so france's half turned to where she pointed,"
3669,2836-5355-0026.flac," as she turned her indignant eyes toward him. sir francis laughed, all stratagem's are fair in love and war. she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued. sir francis broke it, pointing with his left thumb,"
3670,2836-5355-0033.flac," which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writing case from it gave it to her. she reached her keys from the from the from the standard her elbow, unlock the case and took from it some bank notes."
3671,2836-5355-0023.flac," and the calmer he spoke, the more cutting were his words. he need not have told her this. what was the secret she inquired in a low tone? nay, i can't explain all. they did not take me into their confidence. they did not even take you."
3672,2836-5355-0006.flac," i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning, i received on the morning of your departure. it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced. she spoke so quietly, so apparently without feeling or passion that her francis was agreeably astonished."
3673,2836-5355-0027.flac, over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle. what have you named that young article there? the name which ought to have been his by inheritance.
3674,2836-5355-0040.flac," if you will accept nothing for yourself, you must for the child. he, at any rate, falls to my share, i shall give you a few hundred a year with him. she beat her hands before her, for her, as if beating off the man and his words."
3675,2836-5355-0032.flac, these apartments are mine now. they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation. will you afford you accommodation? will you afford you accommodation? will you be so obliging? i am not strong as to hand me that writing case. sir francis walked to the table she indicated.
3676,2836-5355-0050.flac," into an adjoining room. when lady isabelle lay down to her arrest, she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep, hit her sleep, her sleep, than she had known of late, also into a dream. she thought she was back at eastlain, not back in one sense."
3677,2836-5355-0003.flac," then i found myself overwhelmed with business, and away from it i could not get. even now i can only remain with you a couple of days, for i must hasten back to town."" she said, after hearing him calmly to the end."
3678,2836-5355-0021.flac," and i say, i think you are on the wrong scent. i do not believe mr. carlyle ever thought of the girl in that way. what do you mean, she gasped? they had a secret between them, a secret between them, a secret between them, not of love, a secret of business, and those interviews they had together"
3679,2836-5355-0025.flac," what reason? i must request you to tell me. i overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings and so gathered my information. you told a different tale to me, sir francis, was her remark."
3680,2836-5355-0038.flac," i beg of you, i beg of you, i beg of you to cease."" she passionately interrupted. what do you take me for? take you for. why, how can you live? you have no fortune. you must receive assistance from someone. i will not receive it from you. if the whole world denied me,"
3681,2836-5355-0031.flac," she, she made no reply. sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child, returned to the fire, and stood a few moments with his back to it. is my room prepared for me? do you know? he presently asked. no, it is not. she quietly rejoined."
3682,2836-5355-0020.flac," i do not understand what you would imply,"" she said, drawing her shawl around her with a fresh shiver. how on the wrong scent? with regard to your husband and that hair girl, you were blindly outrageously jealous of him. go on."
3683,2836-5355-0009.flac," would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason. her heart beat a little quicker, but she still did. you deemed that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir fran, would have the wife of sir fran, would wife of sir fran's is levison? he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time."
3684,2836-5355-0000.flac," settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction. to speak and act, let there be plain truth between us at this sin of you if there never has been before. i don't say sin before. i don't say sin before. i don't understand you. naked truth, unglossed over."
3685,2836-5355-0008.flac," it would have been better to have undissieved me then, to have told me that the hopes i was cherishing for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain. i did not, it did not judge so,"" he replied. the excited state you then appeared to be in"
3686,2836-5355-0044.flac, he took out his pocketbook and he took and placed the bank notes within it. your clothes?
3687,2836-5354-0047.flac," and white and sleedy and sloppy. the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets were unusually black, and the people crept along especially dismal. close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom,"
3688,2836-5354-0050.flac," she had had a long illness, terminating in a low fever."
3689,2836-5354-0037.flac," now, don't put yourself in a fever. isabel, how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you? it does no good. is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england? have you no pity for your child? she urged an agitation."
3690,2836-5354-0045.flac, you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us. the instant news of the divorce shall arrive.
3691,2836-5354-0040.flac, nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed.
3692,2836-5354-0042.flac," scaresly had she closed the door upon herself and the tre-tree, once her francis levison appeared equipped for traveling. good-bye, isabelle said he, without further circumlocution or ceremony."
3693,2836-5354-0035.flac," you might not be back in time. you might not be back in time. in time for what? oh, how can you ask? she rejoined. you ask. she rejoined in a sharp tone of reproach. you know too well. and you, well, and you, well. and time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear. i shall chance it."
3694,2836-5354-0052.flac," had he come? who is it? had has it? has it? she asked of the nurse. malady it is meshur, and pierre is with him. i have beg malady often and often not to fret, from his show would surely come, malady. see, i am right."
3695,2836-5354-0051.flac, that a lady would soon get about if she would only rouse herself. she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it.
3696,2836-5354-0028.flac, we have much pleasure and congratulate we letting you upon your accession to the title and we and the states and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you.
3697,2836-5354-0029.flac," on your favoring us with instructions. and we remain sir, remain sir, remain sir, most faithful to yours, mauson grab. sir francis levison barked. the outside of the letter was super-scribed as the other, f. levison s. quire."
3698,2836-5354-0027.flac," after sending off our last data today, we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison, your grand uncle. he expired this afternoon in town where he had come for the benefit of medical advice."
3699,2836-5354-0030.flac," at last, thank the pigs, was the gentleman's euphonious expression as he tossed the letter open on the breakfast table. the divorce is granted, feverishly uttered. it's granted, feverishly uttered, lady isabel. he may no reply but seated himself to breakfast."
3700,2836-5354-0041.flac, where is pierre? malady asks.
3701,2836-5354-0043.flac," lady isabel excited beyond all self-control, slip the bolt to the door, and half leaning against it, half leaning at his feet held up her hand in supplication. francis, have you any consideration left for me, any in the world?"
3702,2836-5354-0033.flac," lady isabel waited till the man was gone, leg on and then spoke, a faint flush of emotion in her cheeks. you do not mean what you say. you will not leave me yet. i cannot do otherwise, he answered. there's a mountain of business to be attended to."
3703,2836-5354-0044.flac," how can he be so alarmed, isabelle? of course i have. he continued in a pee-vish-tho-kind tone, as he took hold of her hands to raise her. no, not yet. i will remain here until you say you will wait another day or two."
3704,2836-5354-0034.flac," besides, i should not choose for the old man's funeral to take place without me."
3705,2836-5354-0048.flac," full of windows and doors and drafts, with its wide hearth and its wide chimney, into which we could put four or five of our english ones, shivered lady isabelle vane. she had an invalid cap on, and a thick woolen invalid shell,"
3706,2836-5354-0025.flac, it was over then and all claim to the name of carla was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabelle forever. captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket. is there any news? she asks.
3707,2836-5354-0054.flac," in a subdued, quiet tone not to draw too near, as any little excitement made her faint now. he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot, as he explained that he really could not get away from town before."
3708,2836-5354-0053.flac," the girl departed, closing the door, and lady isabelle sat looking at it, schooling her patients. another moment, and it was flung open. sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in. she waved him off, begging him,"
3709,2836-5354-0031.flac," you may drop that odious title, isabelle, which has stuck to me too long. i own a better now. what one, pray? oh. what one, pray? oh. what one, pray? you can look and see. lady isabelle took up the letter and read it. sir francis swallowed down his coffee and rang the head."
3710,2836-5354-0036.flac, cooly observes her frances. chance it. chance the legitimacy of the child. you must assure that before all things.
3711,2836-5354-0038.flac," nothing can repair the injury. if you want suffer it to come upon him, he will be a byword amidst men throughout his life. you had better have written to the law, lords, to urge on the divorce. he returned. i cannot help the delay."
3712,2836-5354-0049.flac," and she shook and shivered perpetually, though she had drawn so close to the wood fire, the wood fire, the wood fire, that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting. and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them, and interpose between them, and the crackling logs."
3713,2836-5354-0046.flac," you will wait. you will wait."" i cannot wait,"" he replied, his tone changing to one of determination. it is useless. you will be useless to urge it. he broke from her and left the room, and in another minute had left the house, pierre attending him. a feeling, a mounting to a conviction,"
3714,2836-5354-0032.flac," table-hand bell, the only bell you generally meet with and take to meet with in france. pierre answered it. put tay-tit. put me up a change of things that he and french, i start for england in an hour. it is very well, pierre responded and departed to do it."
3715,2836-5354-0026.flac, news of the divorce i mean. tush was the response of captain levison. as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a far off affair.
3716,2836-5354-0039.flac," there has been no delay quite the contrary, but it may be expected hourly now. you are worrying yourself for nothing, isabelle, i shall be back in time."" he quitted the room as he spoke, and lady isabelle remained in it, the image of despair."
3717,2836-5354-0009.flac," reputation, home, all that makes life of value to woman. she had forfeited her duty to god and deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison."
3718,2836-5354-0014.flac, missy remarks the countenance worse than sickness. her face was white and mid and worn. her hands were thin. her eyes were sunken and surrounded by by a black circle. care was digging caves for them.
3719,2836-5354-0006.flac," lady, wife, mother, should you ever be tempted to abandon your home, so will you awake. whatever trials may be the lot of your married life, life, life. though they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature,"
3720,2836-5354-0004.flac," she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror, from which there was never more any escape, never more, never more. the very instant, the very night of her departure, she awoke to what she had done, the guilt,"
3721,2836-5354-0000.flac," nearly a year went by. lady isabel carlisle had spent it on the continent. that refuge for such fugitives. now moving about from place to place with her companion, now stationary and alone. quite half the time."
3722,2836-5354-0012.flac," furnished in the vicinity of the plask grenade. a windy, for a windy, for a windy old house it was, full of doors and windows, chimneys and cupboards, and he said he should remain there. lady isabel remonstrated."
3723,2836-5354-0020.flac, little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation. anymore than he had made it to others who had gone for her. she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself.
3724,2836-5354-0011.flac," it was sharply wounding her with its outer stings. and she knew that her whole future existence, whether spent with that man or without him, would be a dark course, it would be a dark course of knowing retribution. nearly a year went by, saved some six or eight weeks,"
3725,2836-5354-0017.flac," and all the time the slifox had got the times in his coat pocket. but he was only obeying the orders of his master. his master, his master. it had been captain levison's recent pleasure that the newspaper should not be seen by lady isabel until he had overlooked them."
3726,2836-5354-0007.flac," the endurance of woman to bear, resolve to bear them, fall down upon your knees, and pray to be enabled to bear them. pray for patience. pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape. bear until death."
3727,2836-5354-0003.flac," when instead of the garden of roses, it had been her persuaders' pleasure to promise her she would fall in, too. but which in truth she had barely glanced at, for that had not been her moving motive."
3728,2836-5354-0010.flac," but the instant the step was irrevocable, the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance sit in. even in the first days of her departure, in the fleeting moments of abandonment, when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience."
3729,2836-5354-0018.flac," you will speedily gather his motive. pierre departed through captain levison's room, and lady isabel took up the letters and examined their superscription with interest. it was known to her that mr. carlisle had not lost a moment."
3730,2836-5354-0016.flac," languadly, she took her seat at the table. just as captain levison's servant, a frenchman whom he served, a frenchman whom he served, a frenchman whom he had engaged in paris, into the room with two letters. point to gazette pierre?"
3731,2836-5354-0021.flac," the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest lovins in domestic privacy. he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy, and she as apathetically answered to it. pierre says there are some letters, he began,"
3732,2836-5354-0023.flac," and they are both in the same handwriting, your solicitors, i believe. up went his hand at the last word, and he made a sort of graph of the letters, stuck to the farthest window, and the farthest window, and the farthest window, opened it and glanced over its contents. sir."
3733,2836-5354-0015.flac," a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health. she knew better, knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart. it was very late for breakfast, but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day?"
3734,2836-5354-0022.flac," last out a whole 10 months, you are in a greaseless air, air, air, air, air. compliments the very opposite to honey, light opposite to honey and sweetness have generally superveined long before. try it if you don't believe me. two letters she continued."
3735,2836-5354-0013.flac," she wished to go farther on, where they might get quicker news from england. but her will now was as nothing. she was looking like the ghost of her former self. talk of her having looked ill when she took the voyage over the water with mr. carlisle. you should have seen her now."
3736,2836-5354-0005.flac," whose aspect had been shunned in the perspective, assumed at once its true frightful color. the blackness of darkness, and a lively remorse, a never dying anguish, took possession of her soul forever. oh, reader, believe me."
3737,2836-5354-0001.flac," taking one absence with the other, he had been away from her, chiefly in paris, pursuing his own course and his own pleasure. ah, fair to it with lady, take it, take it, is it bell? just as it must be expected to fare and does fare, we"
3738,2836-5354-0002.flac," when a high principal general woman falls from her pedestal, never had she experienced a moment's calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home. she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion."
3739,2836-5354-0019.flac," in seeking a divorce, and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected. she was anxious for it. anxious that kept it in for it. anxious that kept it in for it. anxious that kept in love and should render her though. in her though. in her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child."
3740,2836-5354-0008.flac," rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience. for be sure that the alternative, if you do rush on to it, will be found worse than death. on worse than death. poor thing. poor lady isabel. she had sacrificed husband, children,"
3741,2836-5354-0024.flac," we beg to inform you that the suit carlisle versus carlisle is at an end. the divorce was pronounced without opposition. according to your request, we hasten to forge you the earliest intimation of the fact. we are sir, faithfully yours, moss and grab."
3742,2518-154826-0033.flac, these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hillside come come that does not want a piece to guard thee. they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
3743,2518-154826-0014.flac," and if they come, i cannot help it. for weariness and the sun's heat, heat, heat, have made my feet like lead. a square of years ago, i would have laughed at such a task, but now it is different."
3744,2518-154826-0021.flac," that lay at random on the green turf, the green turf, the green turf. i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones. i felt accounting the blades, feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at 30."
3745,2518-154826-0003.flac," and i felt a thinking dismoly of the plight we were in. how things had been against us in these last days? first, there was losing the why-not, and that was bad enough. second,"
3746,2518-154826-0004.flac," there was the being known by the ex-size for smugglers and perhaps for murderers. third and last, there was the breaking of my leg which made escapes so difficult. but most of all,"
3747,2518-154826-0001.flac," with the straight sunpath across it, spangled in wooden gleaming like a mackerel's back. the relief with being once more in firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken."
3748,2518-154826-0024.flac," he enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen. he dropped down again with a look of relief and said, tisbitta lads scaring rooks with a blender bus. we will not stir unless he makes this way. a minute later he said, the boy is coming straight for the wall."
3749,2518-154826-0043.flac," which was just putting on the brighter green of spring, which green of spring. this turf was not smooth, but hummucky, for under atlay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago, which the green vestment had which had covered for the most part."
3750,2518-154826-0052.flac," he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders, and screened my dangling leg from getting caught. thus he came safe without stumbled to the bottom of the pit. when we got there, all was dark, but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand."
3751,2518-154826-0036.flac," then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the human cry. but before elzavir was on his feet again, the boy was out of sight over the hillbrow. let us move on,"" said block, tisbott, a little distance now to go, and the heat is passed already."
3752,2518-154826-0026.flac," but elzavir passed in the time of day in a civil voice, and he stopped and gave a head back. what are you doing here, son? block asked. scaring rooks for a farmer-top was the answer."
3753,2518-154826-0049.flac," there, he said, this is joseph's pit, and here we must lie hid until they foot is sound again. once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hugh and cry."
3754,2518-154826-0010.flac," it was afternoon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year. when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sword of the open down, sprinkled with tiny white snail shells,"
3755,2518-154826-0048.flac," and the sword crept over the edges of the- and the- the whole, and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns. the green ferns shrouded the walls of the whole, and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps."
3756,2518-154826-0012.flac," behind one of these walls, broken down in places, but held together with struggling ivy, and buttrustling ivy, and buttrustling ivy, and buttrust here and there with a bramble bush. elsevier put me down at length and said, i am beat and can carry the no farther for this present."
3757,2518-154826-0034.flac," and so i said as much to elsevere, who only laughed, saying the boy was simple and harmless. but from where i sat, i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap, and see without being seen. and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough."
3758,2518-154826-0005.flac," there came before my eyes that gray face turned up against the morning sun, and i thought of all it meant for grace, and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy. then elsevere sat up, stretching himself like one waking out of a sleep."
3759,2518-154826-0042.flac," from the bottom of the shaft, they're spread out in arrow passages or tunnels, mostly 60 high, but sometimes only three or four. and in these, the marble is dug. these quarries were made by man centuries ago, some stayed by the romans themselves."
3760,2518-154826-0040.flac," although i knew little of these quarries, and certainly was an evil plight to take note of anything at that time, yet afterwards i learnt much about them. out of such excavation comes that black, per-beck marble which you see in old churches in our country."
3761,2518-154826-0011.flac," the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields. it was a bleak, it was a bleak, it was a bleak, wide-bidden place enough, looking as if it would never pay for turning. and instead of hedges, there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar."
3762,2518-154826-0041.flac," and i'm told in other parts of england as well. and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel, slanting very steeply down into the earth, like a well turned a skew. till you reach 50, 70, or perhaps 100 feet deep, then,"
3763,2518-154826-0018.flac, and now that i was under the leave of the wall.
3764,2518-154826-0046.flac," on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches. down these steps, no feet ever walked now. for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of these shafts,"
3765,2518-154826-0039.flac," el severe was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried. and in less than half an hour i knew, though i had never been there before, we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point."
3766,2518-154826-0029.flac," and his voice had something of surprise in it. nay, but my shot are over small."
3767,2518-154826-0002.flac," and the wind, which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge, seemed now, now, but the journalist of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea. but this was only for a moment, for the anguish came back and grew a pace."
3768,2518-154826-0037.flac," we must have slept three hours or more, for thou art but of sorry watchmen john. tis one is the century sleeps that the enemy laughs, and for thee the posse might have had its both like daylight owls. with that, he took me on his back and made off with the lusty stride."
3769,2518-154826-0031.flac," the smugglers got off clear, but they said the human cry is up already, and that a head price will be fixed of 20 pounds. so if i sell you a fouling piece, maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master. the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion."
3770,2518-154826-0038.flac," and in the shelter of the walls. we had slept longer than we thought, for the sun was westering fast, and though the rest had refreshed me, my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more indangling when we started again."
3771,2518-154826-0013.flac," though there is not now much farther to go. we have the past per-baked gates, and these walls will screen us from prying eyes, if any chance come or pass along the down. and as for the soldiers, they are not likely to come this way so soon."
3772,2518-154826-0027.flac," have you got a charge of- you got a charge of powder to spare, sit else of ear, showing his pistol? i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask. maybe you've seen a flask and walked through the furrows. he whispered to me to lie still."
3773,2518-154826-0023.flac," and though i could see nothing, i knew that a shot had been fired very near us. i was for waking elsevere, but he was already full awake, and put it a finger on his lip to show i should not speak. then,"
3774,2518-154826-0032.flac," for while he spoke, i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot. though i tried to keep it in the shadow, and that he saw the boot clotted with blood, and the curchef tied around my leg. tis for that very reason says el sivir, that i want the firelock."
3775,2518-154826-0009.flac," that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out. at first, elsevere walked briskly, but as the day were on went slower."
3776,2518-154826-0051.flac," and how far off we were now, and how long it was likely to be before i saw that deer village and grace again. the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn, but elsevere paid great care to his feet, lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown."
3777,2518-154826-0008.flac," and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields. i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not have i wished. wished, wished. for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish."
3778,2518-154826-0053.flac," and walked on as if he knew the way. i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock, high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright, but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down,"
3779,2518-154826-0019.flac," and gets a little bit length into the shelter. moreover, though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzavir, i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the willingness of pain to love me to slumber."
3780,2518-154826-0016.flac," i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound, and he took my skew's silver-butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly."
3781,2518-154826-0025.flac," we shall have to show ourselves. and while he spoke, there was a rattle of falling stones, where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall, and so elsevere stood up. the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off."
3782,2518-154826-0045.flac, and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush.
3783,2518-154826-0020.flac," then i sought something to fix my thoughts, and looking on that side of the wall where the sword was, felt accounting the mull hills that were cast up in numbers there about. and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up 30 little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth."
3784,2518-154826-0017.flac," with that, he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall, of the wall. in a minute, i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep. the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west."
3785,2518-154826-0006.flac," and said, we must be gone. they will not be back for some time yet. and when they come, we'll not think to search closely for us hereabouts. but that we cannot risk and must get clear away."
3786,2518-154826-0007.flac," this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in perbeck which they call joseph's pit his pit's pit and there we must go, but it will take all the day to get there"
3787,2518-154826-0050.flac," and before they come to where we lie, we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them. we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps. back first, this one goes down a hatch way."
3788,2518-154826-0030.flac," but that must pay a shilling for them. my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or a buzzard, or something fit to cook come over. i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth it, but worth a shilling. if thou art beat, be beat for something more said else of your the tempter."
3789,2518-154826-0035.flac," but when elves of irs sat down, the boy gave a careful look round, the crowd, and seeing no one watching anymore."
3790,2518-154826-0015.flac," so sit the here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall. and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways. then, if thou see ought moving, wake me up."
3791,2518-154826-0022.flac," but would go on for millions and millions and millions and millions. and before i had reached ten in soharao conumeration was faster, conumeration was faster sleep. but a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg."
3792,2518-154826-0054.flac, and carrying me in a very constrained attitude. only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinderbox and let it match.
3793,2518-154826-0028.flac," no time was wasted in words. elzevere had the flask in his pocket, and the boy was biting the crown. what shot have you said elzevere? what? have you dropped your shot flask 2? ask the boy."
3794,2518-154826-0000.flac," the day was still young, and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel, with a silver-gray film of nightmests not yet lifted in the offing. a hammocky up and down line of cliffs."
3795,2518-154826-0047.flac," for if it were not for this holy purpose, the band- was the band drive would have power to strangle the man that huged it. it was by the side of one of these old shafts that lls have really been down at last. the light was very low."
3796,2518-154826-0044.flac," though it left sometimes a little patch of broken ruffle, though it should broken ruffle, it should broken ruffle, peering out at the top of the mound. there were many tumble-down walls, and though gabel's left of the cottages of the old quarrymen, the thoremen. grass-covered ridges marked out the little garden folds."
3797,2518-154825-0031.flac," but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down in bid thee. i did as bidden and he lowered me gently, setting me on all fours upon the path, and speaking again,"
3798,2518-154825-0039.flac," both run all fours now. else of your first, fours now. else of your first, and i following. but as i crept along, i relaxed care for a moment, and my eyes wandered from the cliffside and looked down. and far below,"
3799,2518-154825-0042.flac," and how he did it in such a narrow straight, i know not, but he turned round. and lying down himself, thrust his hand firmly in my back, pressing me closer to the cliff. yet it was none too soon. for if you had not held me tight,"
3800,2518-154825-0008.flac, and he jerked his thumb at musqueue.
3801,2518-154825-0045.flac," and in five more they will be on the undercliff. and if we ever reach the top, who knows but they have left a guard? no. no, they will not leave a guard for not a man-man knows of the zigzag. and if they knew?"
3802,2518-154825-0052.flac," now, i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch, fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes. and elzavir, for all he was so strong, could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path."
3803,2518-154825-0054.flac," it is all up, another minute, and they will see us. but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear, that when i heard those voices from below, i'll fright a falling left me in a moment."
3804,2518-154825-0044.flac, so i gave out one gave out one gave out one two three and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself those words seemed thin and far far far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here
3805,2518-154825-0000.flac, how fearful and dizzy it is to cast one when i so though i look no more.
3806,2518-154825-0041.flac," felt a sickening pink whalm in swimming of the brain, and knew that i was giddy and must fall. then i felt the must fall. then i must fall. then i called out to elzavir, and he, guessing what had come over me, felt the must come over me, christ to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff."
3807,2518-154825-0051.flac," move thou must, and his better-drisk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on. and with that, he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar, moving backwards himself, and setting to drag me after him."
3808,2518-154825-0029.flac," thus he went on for a time that seemed without any—and yet was really better men or two. and by—and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive it all on the undercliff, blow fresher and cold on the cliffside."
3809,2518-154825-0010.flac, and they will take the alive. and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail. i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end.
3810,2518-154825-0024.flac," we have 15 minutes yet to win or lose with, and if we gain the cliff top in that time, we shall have an hour's start or more. for they will take all that to search the undercliff. and musqueue 2"
3811,2518-154825-0003.flac," safe with a discharged pistol in our grasp and a shot man lying at our feet. elzavir, your feet. elzavir, your feet. elzavir was the first to speak. can you stand, john? is the bone broken?"
3812,2518-154825-0018.flac," tis better far to die upon the rocks below, than to wait here for them to hail us off to jail. and with that, i tried to stand, thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg."
3813,2518-154825-0009.flac," and therefore do not blame the if thou didst make me waste a charge an air. so one thing we can do is to wait here until they come, and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down. but thou can'ts not fight with a broken leg."
3814,2518-154825-0032.flac," the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee, and thee, and thee, and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees. but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner, and the balance of thy body to the cliff."
3815,2518-154825-0027.flac," in a minute, i knew from elzavir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk. now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path, even free and untrammeled."
3816,2518-154825-0005.flac," ever so little it caused me to sharp pain for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot. ever they have broke the leg though it bleeds little, elzavir said. we have no time to splice it here."
3817,2518-154825-0048.flac," i think i could have done it. but there was only the cliff wall, sheer and white against that narrowest way, with never a cranny to put a finger into. the wind was blowing in fresh puffs, and though i did not open my eyes."
3818,2518-154825-0049.flac," i knew that it was moving the little tuffs of bent bent bent bent grass. and the chiting cries of the ghoul seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg. and fling myself off, self-off, self-off, onto the rocks below. then elzavir spoke, john, he said."
3819,2518-154825-0040.flac," i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror. i said, and the goal's wheeling about the sheer chalk wall. and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps. and in an instant,"
3820,2518-154825-0016.flac," yet, is thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair? i will carry thee some way, and where there is no room to carry."
3821,2518-154825-0012.flac," there is yet another way that we may try, and if thou hast but two whole legs, i would have tried it, and now it is a little sort of madness. and yet, if thou fearst not, i will still try it."
3822,2518-154825-0013.flac," just at the end of this flat ledge, farthest from where the bridal path leads, left leads down, but not 100 yards from where we stand. there is a sheep track leading up the cliff. it starts"
3823,2518-154825-0037.flac, and then while he knelt down upon the path.
3824,2518-154825-0046.flac," like sitting ye emotes against the cliff face. so he talked to himself, and all the while i would have given him a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther. yet could not, for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me."
3825,2518-154825-0056.flac," thinking that we were hiding by the sea. five minutes later, think later, later, later, else of your stepped onto the cliff top with me upon his back. we have made something of this throw, he said, and are safe for another hour, though i thought that gidea had ruined us."
3826,2518-154825-0021.flac," for the zigzag, started off as a fair enough chalk path, but in a few pieces narrowed down, till it was but a wider thread against the gray white cliff face."
3827,2518-154825-0053.flac," so he gave it up, leaving go hold on me with a groan, and at that moment there rose from the undercliff, below a sound of voices and shouting. zowns, they are down already quite elsevere, and have found mascuse body."
3828,2518-154825-0030.flac," and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzavir went slower and slower till the last he spoke. john, i am going to stop."
3829,2518-154825-0035.flac," forgetting what i suffered cried out, quicken thy pace lad if thou canst, thou canst, the time is short. now, so frail is not short. now, so frail is man's temper, that though he was doing more than any ever did, for he did ever did to save another's life, and was all i had to trust to in the world, yet,"
3830,2518-154825-0020.flac," and was a task that might cow the bravest. and when i looked upon the zigzag, it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse, then set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below."
3831,2518-154825-0011.flac," so only gave a sigh, wishing heartily that miss, the sigh, wishing heartily that miss, the sigh, wishing heartily that misguided were not dead, and that my leg, leg, were not broke. but that i was back again at the why not, or even hearing one of dr. sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlor."
3832,2518-154825-0019.flac," and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off onto the sword. it was a sight to stagger any man, and would have made me swoon perhaps, but that there was no time for we were at the end of the undercliff."
3833,2518-154825-0022.flac," fah said el zavir, to his support be the beast, his lost his foothold. it was an ill omen enough, and i said as much, the seaching him, the seaching him to make his own way at the zigzag."
3834,2518-154825-0015.flac," i never heard but one had climbed it, and that was land or jordan when the excise was on his heels, half a century back. but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot, and a moonded bird like thee may not dare that flight."
3835,2518-154825-0017.flac," it was a desperate chance enough, but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies. yes, i said. dear master elzavir, let us get to it quickly, and if we fall?"
3836,2518-154825-0028.flac," and not a man in all the world to do it was a full-grown lad in his arms. yet elzavir made no bones of it, nor spoke a single word. only he went very slow, and i felt him scuffle with his foot."
3837,2518-154825-0055.flac, and i could open my eyes with how to trace of giddiness. so i began to move forward again on hands and knees. and elzavir
3838,2518-154825-0007.flac," we have a quarter of an hour before the posse can get down to us. but come, they will. and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty."
3839,2518-154825-0002.flac," and was only shooting at a venture. we were safe, but for how short a time. safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us."
3840,2518-154825-0036.flac," but here was another difficulty. for the path was still so narrow, and the cliff was so close that he could not take me up in his arms. so i lay flat on my face, and he stepped over me, setting his foot between my shoulders to do it."
3841,2518-154825-0050.flac," there is no time to play the woman. another minute of this and we are lost. pluck up like courage. keep that eyes to the cliff and forward. yet i could not, but answered, i cannot. i cannot."
3842,2518-154825-0047.flac," thus, i lay with my face to the cliff and else of your pushing firmly in my back. and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of. for had there been a piece of string, or even a thread of cotton,"
3843,2518-154825-0006.flac," but i will put a curtchey frowned, and while i wrap it, listen to how we lie, and then choose what we shall do. i nodded, biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me, and he went on."
3844,2518-154825-0004.flac," i cannot stand, i said, there is something gone in my leg, and i feel blood running down into my boot. he knelt, knelt, knelt, and rolled down the leg of my stalking. but though he only moved my foot,"
3845,2518-154825-0001.flac," shakespeare. the wild chalk was the bulwark between us and the foe, and the one or two of them loosed off their matchlocks trying to get at us as sideways. they could not even see their quarry."
3846,2518-154825-0025.flac, we'll keep them in check a little while they will they will they will they try to bring the life back to so good a man. but if we will if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning.
3847,2518-154825-0023.flac," and leave me and leave me where i was, for that they might have mercy on a boy. tush, he cried, it is thy heart that fails thee and is too late now to change counsel."
3848,2518-154825-0034.flac," but spent much time that was so precious in traveling those ten yards to take me around the first elbow of the path. form a bow of the path. for my foot was heavy and gave me fears, but fears, fears, pain to drag, though i tried to mask it from el zavir. and he,"
3849,2518-154825-0014.flac," where the underclift eyes back again into the chalk face, and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top. the shepherds call it the zigzag, and even sheep lose their footing on it. end of men."
3850,2518-154825-0038.flac," putting my arms around his neck, and so he bore me, put me, pick it back. i shut my eyes firm again, and thus we moved along another, put another spell, mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening."
3851,2518-154825-0043.flac," i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness. keep that eye shut, john,"" he said, and count up numbers loud to me, that i may know thou art not turning faint."
3852,2518-154825-0026.flac," so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid the open them. with that, he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm, rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me."
3853,2518-154825-0033.flac," for there is no room to dance hornpipes here. and hold that eyes fixed on the chalk wall, looking neither down nor seaworthen. it was well he told me what to do and well i did it."
3854,2436-2481-0021.flac, i told him about anita. carter cut in on us from the chart room. stop that you fools! we cut off. fully dressed. i flung myself on my bed. anita might die. i must have fallen into it.
3855,2436-2481-0029.flac," and hear him. i don't want to kill you, i want to kill you, helgen. we need you. he gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms, carried me swiftly across the deserted deck."
3856,2436-2481-0006.flac," moa, with a night robe drawn tight around her thin, tall figure, edged up to me. what has happened, setsaljan?"
3857,2436-2481-0033.flac, miko got into her state room and tried to force his love upon her. his love upon her. she repulsed him. he killed her. it struck me blank. and then with a rush kin of thought.
3858,2436-2481-0017.flac," it wasn't, wasn't broken. the assailant opened it somehow, and assaulted, and assaulted miss prince. shutter in the chest with a heat ray. her left lung. shutter? yes. but she did not see who did it."
3859,2436-2481-0004.flac, he paused at the sound of captain carter's voice behind us. was it from in there? wait a moment. carter dashed up. he had a large heat ray projector in his hand. he shoved his aside. let me... me in first. is the door sealed?
3860,2436-2481-0037.flac," the door of the sh- door of the shining garden was closed. a brief glimpse given to me to her, to her, to her of what might have been. and now."
3861,2436-2481-0032.flac," she told us before she died. died! i left to my feet. she... died. yes, greg. now we're her go."
3862,2436-2481-0014.flac, but why? why? whom? had george prince been in his own room when the attack came? i thought now i recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with dr. frank.
3863,2436-2481-0036.flac," we don't want him killed. not attacked even. not yet. we'll explain later. they sat me down, calming me. anita. dead."
3864,2436-2481-0003.flac," passengers standing at their cabin doors. i shouted, go back to your rooms. we want order here. keep back! we came to the twin doors of a22 and a20. both were closed. dr. frank was in advance of snap in me now."
3865,2436-2481-0008.flac," the captain rast. get out, helgen!"
3866,2436-2481-0007.flac," i could see only carter, but i heard the murmuring voice of dr. frank."
3867,2436-2481-0001.flac," was still. but now we heard a commotion inside, the rasp of opening cabin doors, questions from frightened passengers. i found my voice. anita! anita prince! come on!"
3868,2436-2481-0018.flac, nor did prince. her scream awakened him.
3869,2436-2481-0012.flac," i'll be there presently, greg."" he slammed the door upon me. i followed his orders, but it was like a dream of horror. the turmoil of the ship gradually quieted. snap went to the radio room."
3870,2436-2481-0022.flac," tortured sleep. i was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer, sound of my alarm buzzer. someone was tampering with my door. then the buzzer ceased. the buzzer ceased. the morater outside must have found a way of silencing it. but it had done its work. awakened me."
3871,2436-2481-0010.flac, tell blackstone what's happened. but... i don't know what's happened. carter was grim and white.
3872,2436-2481-0019.flac, i was glad i didn't have enough to get away. i would lie down for an hour and then go to anita's state room. i demand that dr. frank let me see her. i went to the stern deck where my cubby was located. my mind was...
3873,2436-2481-0000.flac," dr. frank's face had gone white. snaps stood like a statue of horror. the deck here was patched, as always, with silver radiance from the deck ports. the empty deck chairs stood about. the scream"
3874,2436-2481-0034.flac," why, we must get him!"" i gathered my wits. a surge of hate swept me, a wild desire for vengeance. why, by god, where is he?"
3875,2436-2481-0025.flac, was empty. but i left and struck a solid- solid body crouching in the doorway. a giant man.
3876,2436-2481-0015.flac," dr. frank and her brother are with her. they're doing all they can. he told us what had happened. anita and george prince had both been asleep, each in his respective room. someone unknown."
3877,2436-2481-0013.flac, blackstone and i sat in the tiny tiny tiny chart room. how much time passed. i do not know. i was confused. anita hurt. she might die. murdered.
3878,2436-2481-0027.flac," savage encounter he struck the weapon for my hand. he had he had dropped his hydrogen torch and tried to grip and tried to grip and tried to grip me, but i twisted away from his hold. so it's you. so it's you quiet great, hulgin i only want to talk without warning a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand"
3879,2436-2481-0026.flac," his electronized metallic robe, electronized metallic robe, electronized metallic robe burned my hands. i lunged against him. i was almost as surprised as he, tea. i shot, but the stab of heat evidently missed him. the shock of my encounter, short-circuited his robe. he materialized in the starlight. a brief."
3880,2436-2481-0009.flac, he admitted the older officer and slammed the door upon me again and immediately reopened it. greg keeps the passenger greg keeps the passenger greg keeps the passengers quieted tell them everything's all right. miss prince got frightened. that's all then go to the turret
3881,2436-2481-0016.flac," had opened a neatest corridor door. wasn't it sealed? yes, but the intruder opened it. burst it?"
3882,2436-2481-0028.flac," it caught me, ran like ice through my veins, seized and numbed my limbs. i fell helpless to the deck, deck, deck, deck, nurse and mussels paralyzed. my tongue was thick and inert. i could not speak nor move."
3883,2436-2481-0035.flac," dr. frank gripped me. like, dug me. like, dug me. the captain said gently, we know how you feel, greg. she told us, told us, told us, before she died. i'll bring him in here to you, but i'll kill him, i tell you! no, you won't, lad."
3884,2436-2481-0023.flac," someone outside, someone outside trying to unseal the door. in the darkness, cylinder in hand, i crept softly from the bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, crouched at the door. this time, i would capture or kill this night prowl."
3885,2436-2481-0020.flac," it had only a bunk, my tiny desk, a chair, and clothes robe. there was no evidence of any intruder here. i set my door and window alarm. then i audio-phone to the radio room. snap? yes."
3886,2436-2481-0030.flac," his warning siren rang out to alert the ship. his spotlight clung to us. meeko ran with me a few steps, then he cursed and dropped me. flood away. i fell like a sack of carbide to the deck."
3887,2436-2481-0031.flac," my tongue was thick, but it moved. yes, i was soon revived. i sat up with... i sat up with... i sat up with dr. frank vigorously rubbing me. i'm all right. i'm all right. i told them what had happened."
3888,2436-2481-0024.flac," the sizzling was faintly, faintly audible. my door sealed, breaking. upon impulse, i reached for the door door, jerked it open. no one there."
3889,2436-2481-0011.flac," i don't mean that. tell snap to watch his radio room, arm yourselves and guard our weapons. i stammered. if she dies, will you flash us word? he stared at me strangely."
3890,2436-2481-0002.flac," he was dashing for the lounge archway. dr. frank and i followed. i realized that we passed the deck door of window of a-22, but they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside."
3891,2436-2481-0005.flac, dr. frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon snap in me. i was unarmed. weapon in hand and and and. snap forced the panic stricken passengers back to their- stricken passengers back to their- stricken passengers back to their rooms. snap reassured them glibly.
3892,2436-2477-0025.flac," i saw the door open and closed. i even thought i could see his blurred outline. she added, why should george prince be sneaking around with you after him? and the purse are acting innocent."
3893,2436-2477-0027.flac, here's something i can tell you now. we've two high-class gold leaf gamblers aboard. do you know that? who are they? shack and dud artly. every detective in greater new york knows them.
3894,2436-2477-0035.flac," he's a man. find out what you can't eat you can't you can't. she drew away from me abruptly. there's a need-and-george print. the need-and-george print. they came to the corner of the deck, but turned back. thenza caught my look and understood it."
3895,2436-2477-0023.flac," the purse looked up, followed the sound with his gaze. i thought that was queer. he never made a move. he never made a move. he never made a move. and then you came along and he acted innocent. why? what's going on? that's what i want to know. i held my breath. vensa?"
3896,2436-2477-0033.flac," a hundred pounds of gold leaf, that's the person's price. he's with them, whatever it is. he promised to do something or other for them. she stopped. well, i prompted. that's all."
3897,2436-2477-0026.flac," i... well, i do trust you. really, i do. really, i do. but the whole thing isn't mine to tell. the somber to tell. the somber to tell. the somber pools of her eyes were shining."
3898,2436-2477-0030.flac, they wanted to know what kind of a- and of a- and of a ship this was. why? because shaq has a cute little eavesdropping microphone of his own. he had it working last night. he overheard george prints in that-
3899,2436-2477-0029.flac," i sat staring at her, staring at her, staring at her. she was a mine of information this girl. and greg, i tried my charms on checkin' dud. my charms on checkin' dud. nice man, but dumb. but dumb, but dumb. whatever's going on, they're not in it."
3900,2436-2477-0032.flac," something about treasure on the moon. shack couldn't understand what, and they mentioned you. then the person joined them. her whispered words tumbled over one another."
3901,2436-2477-0028.flac," they had a wonderful game with that englishman sir arthur this morning. strip tim of half a pound of eight-inch leaves. a neat, neat, neat little stack. a cricket game, of course. those fellows are more nimble-finger than rant's rank and ever dared to be."
3902,2436-2477-0024.flac," where did the prowler run to? can you, she whispered calmly."
3903,2436-2477-0036.flac, she turned turn turn solemn. you may be interested to know she loves you. i could loves you. i could loves you. i could see it. i knew it when i mentioned you to her this morning me why we've hardly spoken is it necessary?
3904,2436-2477-0034.flac," shaxe's current was interrupted. tell him to interrupt it. tell him to try it again, venser. i'll talk with him. no! i better let...let...let...let him alone. can you get him to keep his mouth shut?"
3905,2436-2477-0031.flac," i guess, vienza, softer. against vienza, softer. against all propriety of this public deck, she pretended to drape herself upon me. her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear."
3906,2436-2477-0009.flac," well, don't be silly vectors. i enjoyed her. i g-give-give-give the gaze that her small slim figure reclining in the deck-chair. her long grey robe parted by design. i have no doubt to display her shapely satin-sheathed legs."
3907,2436-2477-0018.flac," she stared at me. i had not answered her, her grin. my mind was too busy with queer fancies. all these fancies, all these words, things are not always, not always what they seem. were these passengers masqueraders? were they put here by george prince?"
3908,2436-2477-0006.flac," with the black heavens and the, with the black heavens and the, with black heavens and the blazing stars was before her. there was an empty seat nearby. she greeted me with a venus form of jock-o-le-ler intimate greeting. ho-lo-lo, greg, sit here with me."
3909,2436-2477-0020.flac," they? anyone? something's going on. you, you know it. you are in it. i saw you this morning, greg. wild hide chasing a phantom. you? and i heard the phantom. a man's footsteps. a magnetic?"
3910,2436-2477-0001.flac," and it took only a few minutes every 12 hours. i had a moment with carter in the isolation of his chart room. this voyage, greg, i'm getting like you. too fenceful. we've got you. too fenceful. we've normal group of passengers apparently."
3911,2436-2477-0010.flac," her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot to the back of her neck. her carminelips were parted with a mucking, a luring smile. the exotic perfume of her enveloped me. she glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes."
3912,2436-2477-0005.flac," we'll all meet here, greg. say about the zero hour. we must take some precautions."" then he dismissed me. i found venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck. a porthole."
3913,2436-2477-0017.flac," do you know opan?"" i interrupted. she shook her head. never heard of him. but he told me plenty at breakfast. by satan, what a flow of words that devil-driver can muster! he and the englishmen don't mesh very well, do they?"
3914,2436-2477-0003.flac, nothing unusual among his things. we searched both his room and his sisters. i did not follow that up. instead i told him about the burn on miko's thick arm. he stared. i wish we were at farakshan. greg.
3915,2436-2477-0008.flac, no man will please me more.
3916,2436-2477-0013.flac," that's what he told me. no, i'd never heard of him. no, did i. and i thought i had heard of every one of importance. he is listed for the same theater. it for the same theater i am. nice sort of fellow. she paused, then added."
3917,2436-2477-0014.flac," if he's a professional entertainer, i'm a motor-oiler. it startled me. why do you say that? instinctively my gaze swept the deck. an earthworm and child."
3918,2436-2477-0012.flac," she sat up to face me. there's a fellow here on the planetara, rance rankin, he calls himself, at our table, a big, good-looking, blonde american. he says he is a magician, ever here of him."
3919,2436-2477-0016.flac," so you must know her as well as i do. rant's rankin', i prompted. she leaned closer, closer toward me. he could fool you, but not me. i've known, known, known to many magicians."" she grinned. i challenged him to trick me."
3920,2436-2477-0007.flac," i have been wondering when you would come after me."" i sat down beside her. why are you going to mars, venza? i'm glad to see you. oh, many thanks. but i am glad to see you, greg. so handsome a man. do you know from venus to earth?"
3921,2436-2477-0011.flac," be serious, i added. i am serious. sober. intoxicated by you, but sober. you, but sober. i said, what's sort of a contract? a theater in ferrick's sean. good money, greg."
3922,2436-2477-0004.flac," tonight when the passengers are asleep, the passengers are asleep, come here to me. snap will be here, and dr. frank, we can trust him. he knows about the grant line treasure? yes, and so do balch and blackstone. balch and blackstone were our first and second officers."
3923,2436-2477-0002.flac," but i don't like the look of any of them, of any of them, of any of them. that obhan, a drawer table. snaky looking fellow, i commented. he and the englishmen are great on argument, but argument, but arguments. did you have princess cabin searched? my breath hung on his answer. yes."
3924,2436-2477-0019.flac," i'd parried. i need a lot of things. what we've just been talking about. and what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning? excitement? greg, you may trust me. for the first time she was wholly serious."
3925,2436-2477-0022.flac," i saw the purse or in the smoking room. he was visible from weight. venza, that prowler went through the smoking room. i know he did. i could hear him."
3926,2436-2477-0015.flac," but not within air-shot. why do you look so furtive, she retorted? greg, there's something strange about this voyage."
3927,2436-2477-0000.flac," i was, i think, of the planeteris officers, the most expert handler of the mathematical calculators, the locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was under ordinary circumstances about all i had to do."
3928,2436-2477-0021.flac," deflecting invisible cloak. you couldn't fool an audience with that, it's too commonplace. if france rankin tried, i gripped her. don't ramble, venza. you saw me? yes, my state room door was open. i was sitting with a cigarette."
3929,2436-2476-0014.flac, has just termed it fetishism.
3930,2436-2476-0015.flac, protested the man at all handside.
3931,2436-2476-0006.flac," said the alarm trigger against any opening of them, and went to bed. the siren for the midday meal awakened me, me, me, me. i had slept heavily. i felt refreshed. i've refreshed. i've refreshed. i found the passengers already assembled at my table when i arrived in the dining salon."
3932,2436-2476-0021.flac, his glance went to the empty seat at my right hand. the venza isn't that—and the venza isn't that her name? he and i are destined for the same—destin for the same—destin for the same theater in farakshan. so the venza was to sit beside me. it was good news.
3933,2436-2476-0010.flac," greg, this is sero abhan. i met the keen, the keen somber gaze of a venus man of middle age. a small, slim, graceful man was sleek black hair. his pointed face, accented by the pointed beard, was pallet."
3934,2436-2476-0025.flac," i answered her greeting and met george prince's casual gaze. he too smiled, as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service i had done her. or was his smile and his smile and an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when i chased him."
3935,2436-2476-0038.flac," had a touch of, had a touch of, of martian accent, worn almost away by living for some years in greater new york. the shock to me came within a few minutes."
3936,2436-2476-0018.flac," the third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument. snap. snap introduced him as rance rank. tim as rance rank. tim as rance rankin. an american. a quiet, blonde fellow of 35 or 40. i ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on."
3937,2436-2476-0020.flac," i'd like to eat in quiet, arguing passengers, passengers always annoy me. there were still three seats vacant at our table, and wonder who would occupy them. i soon learned the answer, for one seat at least. rankin said calmly."
3938,2436-2476-0003.flac, when i mentioned the person who seemed to have been watching the earlier in the night night night night and again was sitting in the smoking room when the when the eavesdropper fled past carter looked startled johnson is all right greg. does he know anything about this grant line affair? no
3939,2436-2476-0007.flac," it was a low vaulted metal room with blue and yellow tube lights. at its sides, the oval windows showed the deck, with its porch on the domeside, through which a vista of the starry firmament was visible. we were well on our course to mars."
3940,2436-2476-0000.flac," i told him what snap and i had learned. the rays from the moon, proving that grantline had concentrated a considerable ore body. i also told him of grantline's message. we'll stop on the way back as he directs greg. he bent closer to me."
3941,2436-2476-0035.flac," not spindly, like most martians, this fellow, for all his seven-feet in height was almost heavy set. he wore a plated leather jerkin beneath his robe, and knee-pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed his gray, hairy pillars of strength."
3942,2436-2476-0028.flac," it's a technical problem of the exogenesis of interstellar navigation. explain it to them, greg. you're an expert. i waived it away with a laugh. there was a brief silence. i could not help noticing sir arthur connison's queer look."
3943,2436-2476-0019.flac," ideal in tricks, not a fool in audience. his keen, amused gaze was on an open. this gentleman from venus and i have too much in common to argue."
3944,2436-2476-0005.flac," i went to my cabin. it was located aft on the stern deck near the stern watch tower. a small, metal room with a chair, a desk, and a bunk. i made sure no one was in it. i sealed the lettuce grill in the door."
3945,2436-2476-0040.flac," as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm, arm, arm. my mind flung back. only last-f-flung back. only last night in the city corridor snap and i had been followed by a martian. i had shot at him, bit him, bit him, bit him with a heat ray. i thought i had hit him on the arm."
3946,2436-2476-0013.flac," my mission is that all the universe shall hear of me. he's preaching the religion of the venus mystics, snap explained. and this enlightened gentleman set up hand ironically, nodding to the man."
3947,2436-2476-0036.flac," he had come into the salon with the swagger, his sword ornament clanking. a pleasant voyage so far, he said to me as he started his meal. his voice had the heavy, throaty, rasp characteristic of the martian. he spoke perfect english."
3948,2436-2476-0024.flac," there seemed little of the villain about him. and i saw anita prince now, as a dark hair-airred, black-eyed little beauty, in feature rizem- rizem- rizem- rizembling her brother very strongly. she presently finished her meal. she rose with him after her."
3949,2436-2476-0026.flac," i gazed after his small white-suited figure as he followed anita from the salon. in thinking of her, i prayed that carter and halsey might be wrong. whatever plotting against the grant mine expedition might be going on."
3950,2436-2476-0030.flac," coming back, we should have a cordon of interplanetary police aboard. sir arthur broke the awkward silence. magnificent sight, the moon, coon, coon, coon, from so close. though i was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it."
3951,2436-2476-0004.flac," but why didn't johnson hear that, and hear that e-stropper? and what was he doing there anyway at that hour of the morning? the captain ignored my questions. i'm going to have that prince sweet searched. we can't be too careful. go to bed, greg. you need rest."
3952,2436-2476-0009.flac," a flight ordinarily of some ten days. there were five tables in the dining-salon, each with eight seats. snap and i had one of the tables. we sat at the ends, with the passengers on each of the sides."
3953,2436-2476-0017.flac," the tall englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgement. my compliments mr. haljinn. i hope you have no strong religious convictions, else we will make your table here very miserable."
3954,2436-2476-0032.flac," the girl was about my own height, that is, six feet, two inches. the man was seven feet or more. both wore the martian outer robe. the girl flung hers back. her limbs were encased in pseudo-male."
3955,2436-2476-0022.flac," ten days of her religious argument three times a day would be intolerable, but the cheerful vencer would help. she never would help. she never would help. she never eats the mid-day meal, so it's not. she's on the deck having orange juice. i guess it's the old gag about diet, eh?"
3956,2436-2476-0002.flac," and he was grim when i told him of the invisible, and the invisible eavesdropper. you think he overheard grantline's message? who was it? you seem to feel it was george prince? i told him i was convinced the prowler went into a-20."
3957,2436-2476-0008.flac," the moon had dwindled to a pinpoint of light, light, light beside the crescent earth. and behind them our sun blazed, visually the largest orb in the heavens. it was some 68 million miles from the earth to mars."
3958,2436-2476-0029.flac," and i've never seen so keenaglance as, and keenaglance as, keenaglance as, rance, rank and shot at me. we're all three people aware of grant line's treasure on the moon, from the moon, from the moon. it's suddenly, and it seems so. i wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over. captain carter was right."
3959,2436-2476-0023.flac," as a man who looked hardly 25. he was at this moment evidently in a game mode. his clean cut, handsome profile with its poetic dark curls."
3960,2436-2476-0027.flac," my attention was—the attention was—the attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table. i heard o'han's silky voice. we passed quite close to the moon last night, mr. dean. yes, said snap. we did, didn't we? always do."
3961,2436-2476-0016.flac," and as a matter of fact, we even argument greg. last snap. this is sir arthur coniston, an english gentleman, lecturer, and sky trotter. that is, he will be a sky trotter, he tells us he plans a number of voyages."
3962,2436-2476-0031.flac," when another incident shocked me. the two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats. a martian girl, martian girl, martian girl, and man. the girl had the seat at my left, with the man beside her. all went the man beside her. all the man beside her. all martians are tall."
3963,2436-2476-0001.flac," at farakshan, i'm going to bring back a cordon of interplanetary police. the secret will be out, of course, when we stop at the moon. we have no right, even now, to be flying this vessel as unguarded as it is. he was very solemn."
3964,2436-2476-0034.flac, the martian equivalent of mr. and miss.
3965,2436-2476-0037.flac, both martians and venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists.
3966,2436-2476-0012.flac," i should have heard of you no doubt, but a smile plucked at his thin grey lips."
3967,2436-2476-0033.flac," she looked as all martians liked to look a very w-w-w-war like amazon, but she was a pretty girl. she smiled at me, with a keen-eyed direct gaze. mr. dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome. you are."
3968,2436-2476-0011.flac," upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament, a device like a star and a cross entwined. i am happy to meet you, sir. be to meet you, sir. be to meet you, sir. his voice was soft. of was soft. of was soft. in deep. abhan, i repeated."
3969,2436-2476-0039.flac," inadvertently pushed back his robe to bear his forearm, in forearm, an instant only, then it dropped to his wrist. but in that instant i had seen, upon the gray flesh, a thin seer turned red, a very recent burn."
3970,2289-152258-0033.flac," that the coffin of muhammad rests somewhere between heaven and earth, the earth, suspended in the enemy that the air. but this fable was invented by enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion."
3971,2289-152258-0032.flac, that the body still lies in the coffin in the same state as when it was first buried.
3972,2289-152258-0040.flac," and this title has been born ever since by the religious chief of the muhammadins. in modern times, the sultans, or rulers of turkey,"
3973,2289-152258-0007.flac," and faithfully paid over to the owners of the goods, the goods, the money he had received. muhammad had no school education. he could neither either read nor write. but he was not ignorant. he was not ignorant. he was not ignorant. he knew well how to do the work entrusted to him."
3974,2289-152258-0004.flac," and he soon became a skillful camel driver. muhammad was very faithful and faithful and honest in all his work. he always spoke the truth and never broke a promise. i have given my promise, he would say, and i must keep it."

4094,2289-152253-0003.flac," one day, shortly after he became king, attila went to the cave to get his fortune told. wise man said he, look into the future and tell me what is before me in the path of life. the hermit thought for a few moments and then said,"
4095,2289-152253-0026.flac," very soon, however, he was again on the warpath. this time, he invaded italy."
4096,2289-152253-0023.flac," and to tell him self-fled to his camp. it was the first time he had ever been defeated. thoresmond, the conqueror, was lifted upon his shield on the battlefield and hailed as king of the visigoths."
4097,2289-152253-0015.flac," in those times, all times, all times, all towns of any great size were surrounded by strong walls. there was war constantly going on."
4098,2289-152253-0012.flac," this made peace, but the peace did not last long. in a few years, attila appeared at the head of an army of 700,000 men. his great force, he marched across germany and into gal."
4099,2289-152253-0011.flac," and, at last, the emperor had to give him a large sum of money."
4100,2092-145709-0016.flac," in another year, i shall be freed from the spell i am under at present, because then the seven years will be over. but before i can resume my natural form, i will be free to go to the next level."
4101,2092-145709-0017.flac," and take possession of the belongings of my forefathers, you must go out into the world and take service as a maid servant. the young princess consented at once and for a whole year,"
4102,2092-145709-0015.flac," the crow came and thanked her for her endurance, and assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been the gust, than they had been the gust, than they had been. and so two years passed away, when the years passed away, when one day the crow came to the princess and said,"
4103,2092-145709-0010.flac," when they had done this, they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay, and screaming and yelling all the time, they dragged her towards the cauldron. she nearly died with fright."
4104,2092-145709-0011.flac, but she never uttered a sound. then of a sudden the cock grew and all the evil spirits vanished. at the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all around the room with joy.
4105,2092-145709-0021.flac," it was difficult to believe that it was the same, for it had all been rebuilt and done up again."
4106,2092-145709-0008.flac," when night approached, she lay down, but though she shut her eyes tight, sleep would not come. sleep would not come. sleep would not come. at midnight she heard, heard, heard to her great horror, someone coming along the passage, and in a minute,"
4107,2092-145709-0009.flac, her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room. they at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace. then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it.
4108,2092-145709-0018.flac," and had worked her little white hands weary, she heard a rustling beside her, and a cry of joy. then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her, who knelt down at her feet,"
4109,2092-145709-0019.flac," and kissed the little weary white hands and hands. i am the prince,"" he said, who you in your goodness when i was wandering about in the shape of a black crow, freed from the most awful torment."
4110,2092-145709-0020.flac," come now to my castle with me, and let us live their happily together. so they went to the castle where they had both endured so much."
4111,2092-145709-0012.flac," it thanked the princess, thanked the princess, thanked the princess most heartily for her goodness, and said that its sufferings had already been greatly, greatly lessened. now, now one of the princess's elder sisters, who was very inquisitive,"
4112,2092-145709-0014.flac," insisted always on keeping watch alone. so she lived in solitude all the day time, and that night she would have been frightened had she not been so brave. but every day,"
4113,2092-145709-0013.flac," that at last the good-natured little princess consented. but at midnight when the odd folk appeared, the odd folk appeared, the odd folk appeared, the elders sister screamed with terror, and from this time on the youngest princess"
4114,2092-145709-0007.flac," the good-natured princess at once left her home and her family, and hurried to the ruined castle, and took possession of the room with the golden bed."
4115,2092-145709-0002.flac," and in this garden, the young, young, youngest princess used often to walk. one day when she was pacing to and fro, when fro and fro under the lime trees, a black crow hopped out of a rose bush in front of her."
4116,2092-145709-0006.flac," and don't forget, get, get, that whatever you may see or hear in the night, you must not scream out. for if you give as much as a single cry, my sufferings will be doubled."
4117,2092-145709-0001.flac," about half a mile from the palace in which they lived, their stutter castle, which was uninhabited and almost a ruin. but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers."
4118,2092-145709-0000.flac," kletka. once upon a time, there were three princesses who were all three young and beautiful, but the youngest, although she was not fairer than the other two, was the most lovable of them all."
4119,2092-145709-0003.flac," the poor beast was all torn and bleeding, and the kind little princess was quite unhappy about it. when the crow saw this, it turned to her and said, i am not really a black crow."
4120,2092-145709-0004.flac," but an enchanted prince who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery. if you only liked princess, you could save me. but you would have to say goodbye to all your own people."
4121,2092-145709-0005.flac," and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle. there is one habitable room in it, in which there is a golden bed. there you will have to live all by yourself,"
4122,2092-145706-0021.flac," and so they flew away. their words rejoiced farco's heart, and he waited impatiently till evening should come, and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes."
4123,2092-145706-0066.flac," before tomorrow night. if he does this, he may go free. if not, he shall be hung, as you have said."" at these words, the princess burst into tears,"
4124,2092-145706-0002.flac, and a complexion like milk and roses. his two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be. for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be.
4125,2092-145706-0022.flac," at last it began to grow dusk, and the sun sank behind the mountains. gradually it became cooler on the hill, and the grass grew wet with dew. then farco buried his face in the ground."
4126,2092-145706-0082.flac," till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked brothers, and ate them and the whole court up in a moment. then farco went straight to the palace and set the princess free, and on the same day"
4127,2092-145706-0068.flac," and sat down on the stump of a tree, wondering what he should do next. suddenly a big wolf ran up and stepped to him, and standing still said, i'm very glad to see you again, my kind benefactor."
4128,2092-145706-0055.flac," my kind benefactor, but what my benefactor, but what my benefactor, but why are you looking so sad? can i be of any help to you, and thus repay, thus repay, your great kindness to me, my me, to me? then farco recognized the mouse whose front paws he had healed and replied,"
4129,2092-145706-0048.flac," on the delighted farco, and farco. but the two brothers had grown quite green with en-pun-un-pun-bi, and only declared the more that farco was nothing but a wicked magician."
4130,2092-145706-0016.flac," and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs. he climbed, and climbed, and climbed to the top of a hill, and laid down in the grass, and as he thought, under the shadow of a big tree."
4131,2092-145706-0059.flac, and the whole court went out to see the wonder.
4132,2092-145706-0056.flac," before, before, before, tomorrow night, all the grain in the kingdom has to be gathered into one big heap, and if as much as a stock of corn is wanting, i must pay for it with my life. is that all answered the mouse?"
4133,2092-145706-0077.flac," for she was shut up in her tower, weeping bitterly. the wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs. but the king was overcome by a sudden terror."
4134,2092-145706-0031.flac," farco was no less willing to help her, than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse, so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing. on the spot the queen bee was cured, and turning to farco she said,"
4135,2092-145706-0037.flac," you are accused of being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter, daughter, daughter, and i condemn you to death. but, if you can fulfill three tasks which i shall set you to do, your life shall be spared."
4136,2092-145706-0079.flac," go on, go on, go on, and at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill, howling horribly, and showing their, going their, going their white teeth. the king and his terror called out out, stop a moment, i will give you half my kingdom"
4137,2092-145706-0052.flac," let the nave collect all the grain in the kingdom into one big heap before tomorrow night, and if as much as a stalk of corn is left, let him be put to death."
4138,2092-145706-0001.flac," of her and their father, the three set forth on their trap of travels. the youngest of the three brothers, whose name was of my spherco, was a beautiful youth with a splendid figure blue eyes, fair hair,"
4139,2092-145706-0005.flac," and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread, and then to refuse to give him a bit of hours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs. his eldest brother was delighted with this proposal."
4140,2092-145706-0003.flac," for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking. ferco fell fast asleep, but the other two remained awake. and the eldest said to the second brother, what do you say to doing our brother ferco some harm?"
4141,2092-145706-0033.flac," and at length reached a strange kingdom. here he thought to himself, he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country, where he had heard that the king's daughter"
4142,2092-145706-0051.flac," let us make it as difficult as possible, and if he fails, he shall die."" then the eldest brother replied, the corn has all been cut, but it has not yet been put into barns."
4143,2092-145706-0061.flac," the little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the land to its help, and together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom. the king could not hide his amazement, but at the same time his wrath increased,"
4144,2092-145706-0080.flac," if you will drive all the wolves away, but farco pretended not to hear and drove some more thousands before him so that everyone quaked with horror and fear. then the king raised his voice again and called out,"
4145,2092-145706-0015.flac," and could only crawl along the ground, not knowing in the least where he was going. but when the sun was once more high in the heavens, federco felt the blazing heat scorch him."
4146,2092-145706-0036.flac," they went to the king and told him that farco was a wicked magician who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the princess. then the king had farco brought before him and said,"
4147,2092-145706-0032.flac," i am most grateful for your kindness and shall reward you someday. and with these words, she flew away humming gailey. then farco wandered on for many a long day."
4148,2092-145706-0028.flac, here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws. for its front paws had both been broken in a trap. farco felt so sorry for the little beast.
4149,2092-145706-0019.flac," become as sharp-sided as the eagle, even if they have been blind from their youth. well, answered the first raven, my eyes are in no want of this healing bath, for heaven be praised."
4150,2092-145706-0064.flac," the more angry he became, for he could not, in the face of his promise, his promise, his promise, put the stranger to death. he turned once more, more to the two brothers and said, his diabolical magic has helped him again."
4151,2092-145706-0074.flac," then return at once to me and get on my back, and i will help you to drive all the wolves together. then farco went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done."
4152,2092-145706-0044.flac," be of good cheer and lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls. and humming galley, she flew away again. farco went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished."
4153,2092-145706-0054.flac," but he could think of no way of escape. the sun sank to rest rest, and night came on, when a little mouse started out of the grass at fargo's feet, and said to him, i'm delighted to see you."
4154,2092-145706-0006.flac," and the two we could wretch, wretch, wretch, seized farco's loaf and ate it all up, all the f***ed all up, all the poor boy was still asleep. when he did awake, he felt very hungry, and turned to eat his bread, but his brothers cried out."
4155,2092-145706-0027.flac," the grateful creature, the creature thanked his benefactor warmly and promised farco to do him a good turn if he should ever need it. farco continued his way until he came to a ploughed field."
4156,2092-145706-0014.flac," poor farco ate up the scrap of bread they had left him, and wept bitterly. but, but, but, but no one heard him, or came to his help. night came on, and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close."
4157,2092-145706-0067.flac," and when the king saw this, he ordered her to be shut up in a high tower and carefully guarded till the dangerous magician should and the dangerous magician should either have left the kingdom or been hung on the nearest tree. faroko wandered out into the fields again."
4158,2092-145706-0012.flac," the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed, the greed, greed. so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day, but when night came his endurance-capeway, and he let his right eye be put out,"
4159,2092-145706-0083.flac, he married her and was crowned king of the country. and the wolves all went piecesfully back to their own homes and farco and his bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together.
4160,2092-145706-0053.flac," the princess grew white with terror. when she heard these, she heard these words. but farco felt much, much more cheerful than he had done the first time, and wandered out into the meadows again."
4161,2092-145706-0030.flac," farco again proceeded on his journey, but he hadn't gone far before a queen bee flew against him, trailing one wing behind her, which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird."
4162,2092-145706-0081.flac," stop! you shall have my whole kingdom if you will only drive these wolves back to the places they came from."" but the wolf kept on encouraging farco and said, go on, go on! so he led the wolves on."
4163,2092-145706-0062.flac, and he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers who kept on repeating.
4164,2092-145706-0072.flac," and with these words he trotted quickly away. then the youth rejoiced greatly, for now he felt that his life was safe, but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess."
4165,2092-145706-0065.flac," but now what third task shall we set him to do? no matter how impossible it is, he must do it or die. the eldest answered quickly. let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom onto this hill."
4166,2092-145706-0011.flac," but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment, and besought them for a second bit. but the more farco wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger,"
4167,2092-145706-0000.flac," kletka. there was once upon a time a man and a woman who had three fine-looking sons, but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves, let alone their children."
4168,2092-145706-0045.flac," the whole court went out to see the wonder, and their astonishment was great at the sight which met their eyes. a splendid palace reared itself on the hill just outside the walls of the city, made of the most exquisite flowers."
4169,2092-145706-0063.flac," than a wicked magician, only the beautiful princess rejoiced over farco's success, and looked on him with friendly glances which the youth returned, then a youth returned. the more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him,"
4170,2092-145706-0024.flac, then farco crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water. no sooner had he done so.
4171,2092-145706-0046.flac," with sunflowers for knockers, and all around, high-asense, with and other sweet-smelling flowers bloomed in masses, so that the air was perfume far and near and enchanted all who were present."
4172,2092-145706-0073.flac, and that he would never see her again if he left the country. he laid down once more on the grass and soon fell fast asleep. all the next day he spent wandering about the fields.
4173,2092-145706-0047.flac," this splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen, by the grateful queen bee, who had summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her. the king's amazement knew no bounds, and the princess's eyes beamed with delight,"
4174,2092-145706-0041.flac," as he was wandering disconsolently about the meadows, the meadows round the palace, wondering how he could escape being put to death, a little beef flew past, and siddled past, and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear."
4175,2092-145706-0007.flac," you ate your loaf in your sleep, you glutton, and you may starve as long as you like, but you won't get a scrap of ours."" ferco was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep, but he said nothing"
4176,2092-145706-0076.flac," increasing in number every moment, until they could be counted by thousands. he drove them all before him onto the hill, where the king and his whole court and farco's two brothers were standing. only the lovely princess was not present."
4177,2092-145706-0078.flac," when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer and calling out to farco, he said, enough, enough, we don't want anymore."" but the wolf on whose back farco sat said to its writer,"
4178,2092-145706-0023.flac, till his eyes were damp with do-drops. and in a moment he saw clearer than he had had ever done in his life before. the moon was shining brightly and lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs.
4179,2092-145706-0034.flac," they had managed to obtain places in the king's service, and when they recognized farco, they recognized farco, they recognized farco with his eyes and legs, sound, and well, they were frightened to death, for they feared he would tell the king of their conduct."
4180,2092-145706-0035.flac," for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before. his brothers noticed this, and envy and jealousy were added to their fear, so much so that they determined once more to destroy him."
4181,2092-145706-0049.flac," the king, although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his commands had been carried out, was very vexed."
4182,2092-145706-0043.flac," a palace shall be built unlike any that king has dwelt in before. just stay here, avert, avert, avert till i come again and tell you that it is finished. having, up, up finished. having, up finished. having said this, she flew merrily away and ferco,"
4183,2092-145706-0026.flac," be of good cheer for i consume heel your leg. and with these words, he poured some of the precious water over the wolf's paw, and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours."
4184,2092-145706-0058.flac," farco, who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word, lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning. the day passed slowly."
4185,2092-145706-0039.flac," no matter how difficult he must succeed in it or die. they did not think long, but replied, let him build your majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this, and if he fails in the attempt"
4186,2092-145706-0050.flac," and turning to the two brothers, he said, he has certainly accomplished the first task, with the aid no doubt of his diabolical magic. but what shall we give him to do now?"
4187,2092-145706-0029.flac," that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner, and washed its small paws with the healing that was the healing water. in a moment the mouse was sound and whole, and after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows."
4188,2092-145706-0013.flac," and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread. after his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life, they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him."
4189,2092-145706-0075.flac," verko himself returned to the fields, and mounting on the wolves back he rode to the wood close by. quick as lightning the wolf flew round the wood, and in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him."
4190,2092-145706-0018.flac," there is a lake down there below us, and anyone who bathed sin in it, though he were at death's door, become sound and well on the spot. and those who washed their eyes with the dew on this hill,"
4191,2092-145706-0017.flac," is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighborhood? i should just think there was, replied the other. many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world."
4192,2092-145706-0020.flac, they are as good as ever they were. but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by a thin arrow many years ago. so let us fly at once to the lake that i may be restored to health and strength again.
4193,2092-145706-0069.flac," what are you thinking about all alone by yourself? if i can help you in any way, only say the word, for i would like to give you a proof of my gratitude. fairko at once recognized the wolf."
4194,2092-145706-0008.flac, and fasted all that day and the next night. but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread.
4195,2092-145706-0057.flac," that needing to stress you, to stress you much? just trust in me, and before the sun sets again, you shall hear that your task is done. and with these words, the little creature scampered away into the fields."
4196,2092-145706-0040.flac," let him be hung. the king let he hung. the king let he hung. the king was pleased with this proposal, and commanded fargo to set to work on the following day. the two brothers were delighted, for they thought they had now got rid of fargo forever."
4197,2092-145706-0042.flac," what is troubling you, my kind benefactor? can i be of any help to you? i am the bee whose wing you healed."
4198,2092-145706-0010.flac," then he could stand no longer, and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out, and his left leg to be broken. when this was done, he stretched out his hand eagerly for the peace of bread."
4199,2092-145706-0038.flac," on condition you leave the country. but if you cannot perform what i demand, you shall be hung on the nearest tree."" and turning to the two wicked brothers he said, suggests something for him to do."
4200,2092-145706-0009.flac," and break one of your legs, then we will give you a bit of our bread. at these words, poor ferco, wept more bitterly than before, and bore the torment of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens."
4201,2092-145706-0060.flac," for in a heap higher, higher, higher than the king's palace lay all the grain of the country, and not a single stock of corn had been left behind in any of the fields. and how had all this been done?"
4202,2092-145706-0070.flac," who's broken leg he had healed, and told him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his life. but how in the world he added, am i to collect all the wolves in the kingdom onto that hill over there?"
4203,2092-145706-0071.flac," if that's all you want done, answered the wolf, you needn't worry yourself. i'll undertake the task, and you'll hear from me again before sunset tomorrow."
4204,2092-145706-0004.flac," he is so beautiful that everyone takes a fancy to him, which is more than they do to us. if we could only get him out of the way, we might succeed better. it's succeed better."" i quite agree with you answered the second brother."
4205,2092-145706-0025.flac," he had not gone far before he met a wolf, who was limping disconsolently along on disconsolently, along on disconsolently, along on three legs, and who on perceiving farco began to howl howl dismaly. my good friend said the youth,"
4206,2007-149877-0031.flac," how goes it? the room was crowded. dru'ae shook hands, beaming good nature, and they f-good nature, and they strolled towards the bar. oh, alright. i haven't seen you in six weeks. when did you get in?"
4207,2007-149877-0005.flac," or that henry e. dicksy, a well-known performer of the day, was then only a few tables off. at rectors, he could always obtain this satisfaction for their, or this satisfaction for their one could encounter politicians, brokers, actors,"
4208,2007-149877-0051.flac," no, where? sedrué."
4209,2007-149877-0025.flac, and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great american upper class. the first grade below the luxurious rich.
4210,2007-149877-0056.flac," said joy, mentioning the popular farce at the time. well, you'd better be going. it's half-faf-faf-faf-faf-faf-d-rate already. any drew out is watch. the crowd was already thinning out considerably."
4211,2007-149877-0054.flac," returned herstward. he's got the money, all right, and a little twinkle passed over his eyes. i don't go much on those things. do you?"
4212,2007-149877-0035.flac," as considered proper, and herstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with cell-ser. what's become of cario? remarked herstwood? i haven't seen him around here in two weeks."
4213,2007-149877-0006.flac," some rich young rounders of the town, all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation. that's so and so over there. was a there. was a there. was a common remark of these gentlemen among themselves."
4214,2007-149877-0049.flac," under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing. under the stars and sweeping night winds, what a lamp flower it must bloom."
4215,2007-149877-0036.flac," barely comes down to the office now. just one boy hasn't he? ashtairstwood. yes, and a swift bacer, laughed rue."
4216,2007-149877-0008.flac," why, he's manager of the grand opera house. house. house. when these things would fall upon druais' ears, he would straighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort. if he had any vanity, this augmented it."
4217,2007-149877-0009.flac," the floors were brightly colored tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark, polished wood which reflected the light and colored stucco work, which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance."
4218,2007-149877-0002.flac," druë was not a drinker in excess. he was not a moneyed man. only craved the best as his mind conceived it, and such doing seemed to him a part of the best."
4219,2007-149877-0041.flac," nevertheless, the fact that your men gather, hear chatter, hear love to pass and sands and rubble elbows must be explained upon some grounds. it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires"
4220,2007-149877-0027.flac," hurstwood knew kerrio quite well, having drunk a glass now and then with him and company with several others, when the conversation was general."
4221,2007-149877-0024.flac," to go to the races, the theaters, the sports sports sports sports, to exporting entertainments at some of the clubs. he kept a horse and neat trap, had his wife, to his wife and two children who were well established in a neat house on the north side to the north side near lincoln park."
4222,2007-149877-0023.flac, these were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously.
4223,2007-149877-0016.flac, the chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the owners.
4224,2007-149877-0050.flac," insect-infested rows of pleasure. see that fellow coming in there?"" said herstwood, glancing at a gentleman just entering, a raid in a high hat and prince albert coat, his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating."
4225,2007-149877-0011.flac," with rich screens, fancy wines, and a line of bargoods unsurpassed in the country. at rectors, druah had met mr. g. w. herstwood, manager of fitzgerald and moise."
4226,2007-149877-0004.flac," he loved fine clothes, good eating, and particularly the company and acquaintance ship of successful men. men, men. when dining, it was a source of keen sense and satisfaction to him to know that joseph jefferson was want to come to this same place."
4227,2007-149877-0003.flac," reckters, with its polished marble walls and floor, its profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and above all its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men, seem to him the proper place for a successful man to go."
4228,2007-149877-0058.flac," come round after the show. i have something i want to show you,"" said hirstwood. sure. said drew, are you late? you haven't anything on hand for the night, have you? add at hirstwood. not a thing. well, come round then."
4229,2007-149877-0040.flac," it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans. that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything, say formalities, where the sharp ear may hear, and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst."
4230,2007-149877-0028.flac, a moderate sense of humor and could tell a good story when the occasion required. he could talk races with herstwood.
4231,2007-149877-0037.flac," no, he can't injure that any, i guess. herstward was standing, his coat opened, his thumbs in his pocket, the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness. he was the picture of fistidius comfort."
4232,2007-149877-0021.flac," too rich, too famous, or too famous, or too successful, with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address, and with these he was professionally tactful, assuming a grave and dignified attitude, paying them the deference which would win their good feeling"
4233,2007-149877-0030.flac," his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks. why? hello, charlie old man!"
4234,2007-149877-0029.flac," and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited, and so managed to make himself almost invariably, most invariably, most invariably agreeable. tonight, he was particularly so since his report to the company had been favorably commented upon."
4235,2007-149877-0061.flac," 12 o'clock,"" said herstward. that's right."
4236,2007-149877-0007.flac," particularly among those who had not yet reached, but hoped, pretty to do so, the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented. you don't say so would be the reply."
4237,2007-149877-0000.flac," on this particular evening, he dined at reckters, a restaurant of some local fame, which occupied a basement of clark and monroe streets. thereafter, he visited the resort of fitzgerald, a resort of fitzgerald and moise in adam's street, opposite the imposing federal building."
4238,2007-149877-0042.flac, the many friends he met here dropped in because they craved.
4239,2007-149877-0060.flac," say, she was a little dandy, i tell you."
4240,2007-149877-0043.flac," the company, the glow, the atmosphere which they found. one might take it, after all, as an augur of the better social order, for the things which they satisfied here, those sensory were not evil."
4241,2007-149877-0044.flac," no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber. the worst effect of such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the material-minded and ambition to arrange their lives, to arrange their lives, to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis."
4242,2007-149877-0019.flac," hundreds of actors, merchants, politicians, and the general run of successful characters about town. and it was part of his success to do so. he had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship, which improved from how do you do."
4243,2007-149877-0012.flac," he had been pointed out as a very successful and well-known man about town. hurst would look the part for besides being slightly under 40, he had a good stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid substantial air."
4244,2007-149877-0018.flac," and a watch chain of solid gold, which held a charm of rich design, and watch of the latest make and engraving. he knew by name and could greet personally with a well-old fellow."
4245,2007-149877-0047.flac," and there would not be one to gain, say, the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain. the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion. yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber."
4246,2007-149877-0015.flac," and capable of creating a good-him, and a good-him, and an impression. his managerial position was fairly important, a kind of stewardship which was imposing but lacked financial control. he had risen by perseverance and industry,"
4247,2007-149877-0039.flac," here come the moths, an endless procession to bask in the light of the flame. such conversation as when may he hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds."
4248,2007-149877-0038.flac," to one not inclined to drink and gift-gift-gift-gifted with a more serious turn of mind, such a bubbling, chattering, glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly, a strange commentary on nature and life."
4249,2007-149877-0048.flac," the dressy greedy company, the small self-interested paliver, the disorganized aimless, wandering mental action which it represents. the love of light and show and finery which, to one outside,"
4250,2007-149877-0059.flac," i struck a little peach coming in on the train friday, remarked roy by way of parting. by george that's so. i must go and call on her before i go away. oh never mind her. her stward remarked."
4251,2007-149877-0017.flac," and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in. for the most part he lounged about, dressed in excellent tailored suits, imported goods, a solitary ring, a fine blue, a fine blue diamond in his tie, a striking vest of some new pattern,"
4252,2007-149877-0045.flac," in the last analysis, that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations, but rather of the innate trend of the mind. such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed,"
4253,2007-149877-0034.flac," george evans was in here saturday and said he saw you in milwaukee last week. milwaukee last week. yes, i saw george return druey, great old boy, isn't he? we had quite a time there together."
4254,2007-149877-0014.flac," and was glad not only to meet him, but to visit the adam street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or cigar. first would wear a cigar. first would was an interesting character after his kind. he was shrewd and clever in many little things."
4255,2007-149877-0055.flac," well, he never can tell,"" said herstwood. there may be something to it. i wouldn't bother about it myself, though. by the way—self, though. by the way, he added, are you going anywhere tonight? the—the hole in the ground."
4256,2007-149877-0022.flac," without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions. there were in the last place a few good followers, neither rich, you good followers, neither rich, you good followers, neither rich, nor poor, famous, nor yet, without yet, yet remarkably successful, with whom he was friendly on the score of good fellowship."
4257,2007-149877-0052.flac," said hurstwood, indicating the direction by a cast of his eye, the man with the silk hat. oh, yes, said druy, now affecting nott to see. who is he? who is he? that's jewel's wallace, the spiritualist."
4258,2007-149877-0046.flac," could scarcely be laid at the door of anything to save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected. remove the element, so thoroughly and solely complained of. lickr."
4259,2007-149877-0013.flac," which was composed in part of his fine, which fine clothes, his clean linen, his jewels, and above all, his own sense of his importance. druy immediately conceived a notion of him as being someone worth knowing,"
4260,2007-149877-0033.flac," leaned toward them from behind the bar. ""'old pepper,' said drewey. ""'little of the same for me,' put in herstwood. ""'how long are you in town this time?' inquired herstwood. only until wednesday i'm going up to st. paul."""
4261,2007-149877-0026.flac," the latter's genial name, nature, and dressy appearance pleased him. he knew that droy was only a traveling salesman, and not one of many years at that. but the firm of barclad cario and company"
4262,2007-149877-0053.flac," druai followed him with his eyes, much interested. ""'doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits, does he?' said druai."
4263,2007-149877-0020.flac," who, by long-frequeting of the place, became aware of his position to the— why old man how were you? which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly. there was a class, however,"
4264,2007-149877-0001.flac," there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey, and purchased a couple of cigars, one of which he lighted. this to him represented in part, high life, represented in part, high life, a fair sample of what the whole must be."
4265,2007-149877-0010.flac," the long bar was a blaze of lights, polish, woodwork, colored and cut glassware, and many fancy bottles."
4266,2007-149877-0032.flac," friday, said droy, had a fine trip. glad of it,"" said herstwood, his black eyes, lips, lips, lips, lips, with a warmth which have displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. what are you going to take? he added as the barkeeper in snowy jacket and tie."
4267,2007-149877-0057.flac," some bound for the theaters, some to their clubs, and some to that most fascinating of all the pleasures, for the type of man they're represented, at least, the ladies. yes, i will, said joy."
4268,2007-132570-0057.flac," i heard my own voice, rejoined montoni sternly. and nothing else?"
4269,2007-132570-0027.flac," opposite to her encasement. she was for a moment inclined to believe it was valencourt whom she had seen. yet, if it was, why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so? and if he was a prisoner in the castle,"
4270,2007-132570-0038.flac," which she obeyed with trembling, and on her way thither endeavored to animate her fortitude with the idea of valencourt. montoni was alone. ""'i sent for you,' said he, to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions."
4271,2007-132570-0054.flac," for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition, it would not now appease my indignation. i will have vengeance, as well as justice, as justice. another grown field of pause which montoni made."
4272,2007-132570-0052.flac," resumed his discourse in a lower, yes, rist-rist-rist-turner voice. i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character, which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me."
4273,2007-132570-0037.flac," the possibility that valencourt was near her revived her fortitude, and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance, at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle. she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoney, requiring her attendance in the cedar parlor."
4274,2007-132570-0049.flac," yet this, it appears, has not been sufficient to deter you."
4275,2007-132570-0048.flac," night repeated another voice. wontown night repeated another voice. montoni paused and turned half-round, but, seeming to recollect himself, not himself, he proceeded in a lower tone. you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly."
4276,2007-132570-0026.flac," but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so, so then you have, ma'am."" emily looked displeased and made no reply. as she mused upon the recollected appearance, which had lately so much alarmed her, and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself,"
4277,2007-132570-0035.flac, and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellence to catch up men. and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms.
4278,2007-132570-0051.flac," yet something like a shade of fear passed over, yet over, yet over his countenance. emily sat down in a chair near the door, for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her. but montoni paused scarcely an instant in commanding his features,"
4279,2007-132570-0044.flac," from her infancy regarded an active injustice, inspired her with a noble, though imprudent, from noble, though imprudent, courage. sine the papers,"" said montoni, papers, said montoni, more impatiently than before. never, sir."
4280,2007-132570-0047.flac," you have dared to question my right, now dare to, you are to question my power, you power. i have a punishment which you think not of. it is, it is, you is terrible. this night, this very night, this,"
4281,2007-132570-0060.flac," whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners, they were perhaps bringing to the castle. at length, having reached her apartment, she threw herself upon the couch, overcome with the new horrors of her situation."
4282,2007-132570-0023.flac," but will fall too, cutting and slashing, but too, cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men. no, no, says i. there is re-re-re-reason in all things."
4283,2007-132570-0033.flac," but she cannot hear them now, poor soul, said i."" emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired a net to go and make inquiry, concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle."
4284,2007-132570-0040.flac," if i have no right in these estate, sir,"" said emily, of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them? if the lands are yours by law, you certainly may possess them without my interference, or my consent."
4285,2007-132570-0053.flac," i could tell you that once my resolution is taken, but i am talking to a baby. let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples i could recite. the recital could not now benefit you."
4286,2007-132570-0024.flac," being because it is because it is no business of mine to look rough and fight battles. emily endeavored to correct the superstitious weakness of a net, though she could not entirely subdue her own, to which the latter only replied,"
4287,2007-132570-0056.flac," quit my presence,"" cried montoney. this affect—affect—affectation of fear will be comes—the heroin who has just dared to—to brave my indignation. did you hear—did you hear—did you hear nothing, signor? said emily, trembling and still unable to leave the room."
4288,2007-132570-0058.flac," obey my order, repeated montoni, and for these fools, tricks, i will soon discover by whom they are practiced. emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her."
4289,2007-132570-0030.flac," the ladies, as they call themselves, who are the elves, who are the elves who are lately come to udolfo. why, that's in your livona that the senior brought to see my late-lady at venice is his mistress now, and was little better than, i dare say. and ludovico says,"
4290,2007-132570-0036.flac," because said he we don't go shares there. this information heightened emily's impatience to know more, and immediately departed on her inquiry. the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations."
4291,2007-132570-0050.flac," i could make you tremble at the bear recital. he was interrupted by a groan which seemed rise from underneath the chamber they were in, and as he threw a glance around it, impatience and rage flashed from his eyes."
4292,2007-132570-0031.flac," a prey-be-secret man that has excellence that introduced her only to impose upon the world, upon the world, upon the world, that had begun to make free with her character. so when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they heard must be scandal."
4293,2007-132570-0034.flac," but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name, or that of montsuer-valencourt. now i think of it, but now i think of it, mumzel, said a net, i do believe there are prisoners, for i overheard one of the seniors' men yesterday."
4294,2007-132570-0032.flac," but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady's death, too."
4295,2007-132570-0039.flac, i will condescent to advise where i make a man.
4296,2007-132570-0041.flac," ""'i will have no more argument,' said montoni, with a look that made her tremble. what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby? but i will be trifled with no longer."
4297,2007-132570-0045.flac," replied emily, that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right. montoni turned pale with anger, while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech."
4298,2007-132570-0055.flac," leave the room instantly,"" said he, seeming not to notice the strange occurrence. without power to implore his pity, she rose to go but found that she could not support her self. aw and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair."
4299,2007-132570-0043.flac," and from the vengeance he threatened. but then the image of valencourt, who so long had loved her, and who was now perhaps so near her, and near her, came to her heart, and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always,"
4300,2007-132570-0029.flac," were the same, or if they were, or whether this was valencourt. she, however, desired that a net would endeavour to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names. oh dear mum, zeal, said a net, i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about."
4301,2007-132570-0025.flac," nay, memzel, you will believe nothing. you are almost as bad as the senior himself, who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened, and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret. this was a hard pun."
4302,2007-132570-0059.flac," but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence, past to the ramparts. as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement, emily saw a party of montoni's troops winding down by a distant mountain,"
4303,2007-132570-0028.flac, and he could be here in no other character. how could he obtain the means of walking broad on the rampart?
4304,2007-132570-0046.flac," then all my vengeance falls upon you. he exclaimed with an horrible oath, and think not it shall be delayed."
4305,2007-132570-0042.flac, let the recollection of your aunt's sufferings in consequence of her folly and obstinacy teach you a lesson. sign the papers. emily's resolution was for a moment odd. she shrunk at the recollections he revived.
4306,2007-132570-0016.flac," oh, lord, how glad i should be if it was so. would you indeed be glad,"" said emily in a tone of mournful reproach. to be sure i should."
4307,2007-132570-0003.flac, if you were to go running about the castle among all these drunken seniors.
4308,2007-132570-0006.flac," no, no, says he, i will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage, and up the marble, marble, marble staircase, and along the north gallery, and through the west wing of the castle, for you, for you, for you shall stay here, and at, you shall not go out of this room tonight. so,"
4309,2007-132570-0008.flac," yes, he did indeed, mum-zell, notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary."
4310,2007-132570-0013.flac," interrupted emily, quite weird by this story. do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice?"
4311,2007-132570-0019.flac," and then it was gone, and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls. so they helped one another, up again, as fast as they could. you would not believe mumzel the way i showed you the very cannon where it used to appear."
4312,2007-132570-0017.flac," good-man replied a net and would not you be glad too to see senior valencourt? i don't know any chevrolet or i like better. mad, mad, like better, like better. i have a very great regard for the senior truly."
4313,2007-132570-0018.flac," you regard for him cannot be doubted, sent emily since you wish to see him a prisoner. why, no, mumzel, not a prisoner, either, but one must be glad to see him, you know, and it was only the other night i dreamt."
4314,2007-132570-0015.flac," now, i dare say you are thinking of montsuerval in court, and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state, and that he has met with some of our people and is taking captive."
4315,2007-132570-0002.flac, and fine trimmings boated no good. i guessed what they were. good god! e-sclaimed emily. what will become of me?
4316,2007-132570-0001.flac," and what is more, not one of those fine ladies sober either, and ladies sober either. i thought when i saw them first, that all those fine silks and fine veils, white mums elder, veils were worked with silver."
4317,2007-132570-0020.flac," and are you indeed so simple? indeed so simple. indeed so simple, annette said emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories. credit these stories? credit these stories? credit them, mumsell. why?"
4318,2007-132570-0004.flac," and across the great hall, and up the marble staircase, and along the north gallery, and through the west wing of the castle, and i am in the corridor, and a- and a- and a- in a minute. are you so, says he, and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way?"
4319,2007-132570-0009.flac, and he mistook ludovico's hull for old car lows.
4320,2007-132570-0005.flac," well, says i, if you think—if you think—if you think there is danger, then go with me, and guard me. i—guard me. i—guard me. i am never afraid when you are by."" what? says he. when i—t— says he. when i am scarcely recovered of one wound, shall i put myself in the way of getting another?"
4321,2007-132570-0021.flac," all the world could not persuade me out of them. roberto and sebastian in half a dozen more of them went into fits. to be sure there was no occasion for that, i said, myself. there was no need of that."
4322,2007-132570-0010.flac," so, we were all as still as night that he might as opposed there was nobody in the room, but the senior was as cunning as the best- as the best of us and kept calling out at the door."
4323,2007-132570-0012.flac," he was as stame as could be, and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a- he- he the piece of meat in his basket. all this i sought he- he- he- he- he- through the keyhole. well, annette said ludovico geringly. shall i let you out now?"
4324,2007-132570-0011.flac," come forth, my valorous, senior steward."" just then old carlo opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand, for as soon as the senior saw him."
4325,2007-132570-0007.flac," well, well, said emily impatiently and anxious to inquire on another subject."
4326,2007-132570-0000.flac," what were they for they disputing then said emily? no, mom's out not fighting now not fighting but almost as good for i believe there was not one of the senior sober"
4327,2007-132570-0022.flac," for, as i, when the enemy comes, what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down and fit all of a row. the enemy won't be so civil perhaps as to walk off, like the ghost, and leave them to help one another up."
4328,2007-132570-0014.flac," but it is expected back tonight or tomorrow and i shall know then perhaps. emily inquired if she had ever heard the servant's talk of prisoners. ah, mum's cell said a net archery."
4329,198-209-0009.flac, for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home. and in the second.
4330,198-209-0015.flac," to show her resentment towards him who could harbor a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble of seeking to keep picking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else, she took to herself all the shame of misconduct."
4331,198-209-0033.flac," as she pointed them out to her asham- asham- asham- andpanion, he knew nothing about it, but his father, like every military man,"
4332,198-209-0004.flac," and with a look which did not quite confirm his words, said that he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out, catherine with a blush of mortification left the house. she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home and too much offended to admit her."
4333,198-209-0024.flac," perhaps you did not know i had been there. i was not within at the time, but i heard of it from eleanor, and she has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such instability, but perhaps i can do it as well. it was nothing more than that my father—"
4334,198-209-0035.flac," in a consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking with, with, general, tell me. he's a witty, he's a witty. he's a final fellow upon my soul, stout, active, looks as young as his son. i have a great regard for him, i assure you."
4335,198-209-0016.flac," or at least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause. the play concluded, the curtain fell, henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained."
4336,198-209-0023.flac," and dependence on catherine's honor. oh, do not say miss—that say miss—at say miss tilney was not angry, cried catherine, because i know she was. for she would not see me this morning when i called. called. i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after by leaving it. i was hurt, but i was not confronted."
4337,198-209-0011.flac," on the beginning of the 5th, however, the sudden view of mr. henry tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress. the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment, no longer keep her whole attention."
4338,198-209-0038.flac," lowering his voice. well, well, well, well, well done, general, said i am quite of your mind."
4339,198-209-0022.flac," i would have jumped out and run after you. is there a henry in the world, the world, i would be insensible to such a declaration? henry till me at least was not. with the yet-sweeters, i was sweetest, sweetest mile, he said everything that need to be said of his sister's concern, regret."
4340,198-209-0003.flac," tripping lightly through the church yard and resolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family, who she had reason to believe, win a shop hard by. she reached the house without any impediment, looked at the number."
4341,198-209-0008.flac," to what a degree of unforgiveness it might with propriety leave, nor to what rigors of ruinous in redotrain it might justly make her amenable. dejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night."
4342,198-209-0031.flac, was engaged in conversation with general tilney.
4343,198-209-0019.flac," my dear, you tumble my- my- my gown with mrs. allen's reply. her assurance, however, standing soul, assurance, however, standing soul as it did, was not thrown away. it brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance."
4344,198-209-0037.flac," the odds were five to four against me, and if i had not made one of the cleanest jokes that perhaps whatever was made in this world, i took his ball exactly. but i could not make you understand it without a table. however, i did beat him, a very fine fellow, as riches had chewed."
4345,198-209-0021.flac," but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk. i never thought of such a thing. but i begged mr. thorpe so earnestly to stop. i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you. now mrs. allen did not—oh, you were not there—but indeed i did. and if mr. thorpe would only have stopped, i would have been there."
4346,198-209-0017.flac," and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box. she was right, in a few minutes he appeared."
4347,198-209-0028.flac," nay, i'm sure by you—sure by you look—when you came into the box, you were angry. i angry, i could have no right. well, no right. well, nobody would have thought you had no right to saw your face."" he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play. he remained with them some time."
4348,198-209-0013.flac, his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes.
4349,198-209-0032.flac," what could they have to say of her? she failed general tilly did not like her appearance. she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter, rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes. how came mr. thorpe to know your father? was her anxious inquiry?"
4350,198-209-0006.flac," at the bottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at a window, but issuing from the door, she saw miss tildi herself. she was followed by a gentleman, whom catherine believed to be her father, and they turned up towards edgar's buildings."
4351,198-209-0002.flac," and mrs. allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful. to milsom street she was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened away, with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her conduct, and be forgiven."
4352,198-209-0027.flac," why were you less generous than your sister? if she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could suppose it to be what would be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take offense? me, i'd take offense."
4353,198-209-0025.flac," and he being hurried for time, and at time, and not caring to have it put off, made a point of her being denied. that was all i do assure you."
4354,198-209-0001.flac," catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room, that she might inform herself of general tilnese lodgings. for those she believed they were in milson street, she was not certain of the house."
4355,198-209-0034.flac," when the entertainment was over, thorpe came to assist them in getting out. catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry, with the object of his gallantry. and while they waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart, almost to the tip of her tongue by asking,"
4356,198-209-0000.flac," mrs. allen said chathryn the next morning, will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today? i shall not be easy till i have explained everything. go by all means, my dear, only put on a white gown. miss tilney always wears white."
4357,198-209-0029.flac," and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away. before they parted, however, he was a grea-er, he was a grea-er, and ver-er, he was a grea-ed, that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible, and was possible, and, setting aside the misery of his quitting their box,"
4358,198-209-0018.flac," you must have thought me so rude, but indeed it was not my own fault, was it mrs. allen? did not they tell me that mr. tilney and his sister were gone out in a fayetin together? and then what could i do? but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you."
4359,198-209-0020.flac," and he replied in a tone which were chained only a little effect of reserve. who are you? who are you? who have much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk, after our passing you in argyles street? you were so kind as to look back on purpose."
4360,198-209-0010.flac," to the theater accordingly, they all went. notil lee's appeared to plague or please her. she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked. but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage."
4361,198-209-0036.flac," no, him. him. there are a few people much about town that i do not know. i have met him forever at the bedford, and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiardroom. one of the finest players we have by the by, and we had a little touch together, though i was almost afraid of him at first."
4362,198-209-0005.flac," and as she retired down the street, could not withhold one glance at the trying room windows, an expectation of seeing her there."
4363,198-209-0012.flac," every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box, and, for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch henry tillney, without being once able to catch his eye. no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play,"
4364,198-209-0030.flac," she was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the world. while talking to each other,"
4365,198-209-0007.flac," catherine, in deep mortification, proceeded on her way. she could almost be angry herself at such angry insuffility, but she checked the resentful sensation. she remembered her own ignorance. she knew not how such an offense as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness."
4366,198-209-0014.flac," and forced him to hear her explanation. feelings rather natural than heroic possess her, instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready-condemnation, instead of proudly resolving, incontious innocence,"
4367,198-209-0026.flac," and meant to make her apology as soon as possible. catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information, yet as something a solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question, thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the gentleman, but mr. tilney,"
4368,198-129977-0008.flac," the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber."
4369,198-129977-0012.flac," it's become a mere jargon. everybody pretends to fill and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what pitcher asked gidey was. i detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself."
4370,198-129977-0027.flac," mrs. jennings enforced the necessity, and she knows, but you may raise a dance, since she, and that will tempt you, miss mary-anne. a dance cried mary-anne impossible, who is to dance? who, why yourselves, and the carries, and the widacres, to be sure?"
4371,198-129977-0022.flac," that it was exactly the shade of her own. edwards embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of mine, still more settled. he was particularly grave the whole morning. mary answer really sent herself for what she had said."
4372,198-129977-0023.flac," before the middle of the day, there were visited by sir john and mrs. jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. with the assistance of his mother-in-law, sir john was not long and discovering."
4373,198-129977-0009.flac," i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brushwood, but these are all lost on me. i know nothing of the picturesque."
4374,198-129977-0017.flac," to a new object suddenly engaged her attention. she was sitting by edward and then taking his tea from mrs. dashwood, his hand passed so directly, to directly, to directly before her, as to make a ring with a plate plate of hair in the center, very conspicuous on one of his fingers."
4375,198-129977-0011.flac," and is disgusted with pletch pretentions, he affects greater indifference, and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. he and possesses. he is fastidious and will have an anfactation of his own, and own. it is very true, said mary ann, that admiration of landscape scenery"
4376,198-129977-0032.flac, hope. i'm sure you will like him.
4377,198-129977-0016.flac," mary ann looked with amazement at edward, with compassion at her sister."
4378,198-129977-0001.flac, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so in it appeared so in it appeared so imperfect. it was evident that he was unhappy. she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring.
4379,198-129977-0007.flac," which ought to be a regular and rugged, and distant objects out out of sight which ought only to be indistinct, through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. you must be satisfied with such an admiration which wish wishing as i can honestly give. i call it a very fine country."
4380,198-129977-0004.flac, as you are not yet ready for breakfast.
4381,198-129977-0025.flac," but as it was, she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret's instruction extended. sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to sign the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening."
4382,198-129977-0024.flac," that the name of ferrer began with an f. and this prepared a future mine of raylory against the devoted eleanor, which nothing but the nooness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung."
4383,198-129977-0026.flac," on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he was to engage them from both. you must drink tea with us tonight, said he."
4384,198-129977-0010.flac," i'm afraid it is but too true, said marianne. true said marianne, but why should you boast of it? i suspect, said eleanor, that too said eleanor, that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another, because he believes many people pretend to more aberration of the beauties of nature than they really feel."
4385,198-129977-0013.flac, because i could find no language to describe them and describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning. unconvince said outward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to fill.
4386,198-129977-0002.flac," but hitherto the continuance, hitherto the continuance, hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain. and the reservedness of his manner that towards her contradicted one moment, what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one."
4387,198-129977-0018.flac," but i should have thought her hair had been darker. marianne's spoken considerably what she really felt, but when she saw how much she had painted edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his."
4388,198-129977-0015.flac, i do not like ruined tattered colleges. i'm not fined of nettles and fissils or heath blossoms. i have more pleasure in a snug farmhouse than a watchtower.
4389,198-129977-0003.flac," he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down, and marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to themselves. but before she was halfway upstairs, she heard the parlor door open."
4390,198-129977-0031.flac," what do you mean? shall i tell you? certainly. well then, i guess that what, what, west that mr. will be, hunts. marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archeness of his, of his, of his manner, and after a moment silent said,"
4391,198-129977-0028.flac," what, you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone? i wish it with all my soul, cried sir john, that will be, we're among us again. this and mary ann's blushing gave new suspicions to edward."
4392,198-129977-0029.flac," and whose will be said he, in a low, low, low, low voice, to ms. dashwood, by whom he was sitting. she gave him a brief reply."
4393,198-129977-0021.flac," she was not in a humor, however, to regard it as an in-front, and affecting to take no notice of what pass by instantly talking with something else. she internally resolved henceforth to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt."
4394,198-129977-0014.flac," but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess. i like fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees. i admire them much more if they are tall, straight and flourishing."
4395,198-129977-0005.flac," this was a subject which ensured mary ann's intention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes."
4396,198-129977-0030.flac," edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others, but such of mary ann's expressions had puzzled him before. and when their visitors left them, he went immediately around her and said in a whisper, i've been guessing, shall i tell you my guess?"
4397,198-129977-0019.flac," he colored very deeply and giving a momentary glance at eleanor replied, yes, it is my sister's hair. the setting always casts a different shade on it, you know. eleanor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise."
4398,198-129977-0020.flac, that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne. the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
4399,198-129977-0000.flac," eleanor saw, with great uneasiness, the low spirits of her friend. his visit afforded her, but a very partial satisfaction."
4400,198-129977-0006.flac," when edward interrupted her by saying, you must not inquire too far, maryanne. remember, i have no knowledge in the pitch-resk, and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars."
4401,198-126831-0013.flac," the poor man meant as a compliment, but felicity, who knew uncle blair was an artist, and had a poor opinion of such fry, looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasn't."
4402,198-126831-0052.flac," i wouldn't have said the story girl honestly. i thought it was a bell when i heard it, and the door opened too. let us be fair, felicity."
4403,198-126831-0010.flac," pat, you've forgotten more than any human being ever knew. and i vow, patty would lick his chops with the light. but to be called a sweet cat. oh, sarah, sarah."
4404,198-126831-0051.flac, it don't sound a bit like other clocks.
4405,198-126831-0005.flac," while sicily admitted that willie fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her, you love me as i love you. no knife can cut our love into, into. but sarah ray, never you breathe this to a living soul."
4406,198-126831-0000.flac, friday was a comfortable day in the household of king. everybody was in a good humor. the story girls sparkled through several tales that ranged from the affrites and gins of eastern myth through the piping days of shivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlisle rokdae folks.
4407,198-126831-0001.flac," she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silk envelope, the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of palestine disguised as a page, gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a cronto."
4408,198-126831-0050.flac," it's all peter's fault, so i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing."
4409,198-126831-0016.flac," a pretty walk through a world of green, whispering bows and spiced sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight. the raspberries were plentiful."
4410,198-126831-0009.flac," the storygirl would box his ears with her fist and say, bless your grey heart, patty, you're a good sort of old rascal, good sort of old rascal, good sort of old rascal, and pat would purr his satisfaction. i used to take a handful of skin on his back, shake him gently and say,"
4411,198-126831-0027.flac," do you think he'll ever tell you who alice is? i asked. i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature, but she would tell us nothing more. when the chili cookies were all eaten, it was high time to be moving homeward."
4412,198-126831-0019.flac," i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward, said the story girl, dremly. and i think there is a way of getting there, getting there, getting there too, if we could only find it."
4413,198-126831-0045.flac," uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door. as he did so, clear and sweet, rang out 10 bell-like rhymes."
4414,198-126831-0020.flac, one better day when they seek it.
4415,198-126831-0042.flac," i know who laughed at us awful, but it's better to be laughed at than scared like this."" uncle roger did not come home till nearly ten. never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in that lane."
4416,198-126831-0033.flac," king's ghost, whispered felix. she never appeared anywhere but in the orchards in the story girl. oh! oh, children! isn't there something under uncle alex tree? we peered fearfully through the gloom. there was something, something that wavered and fluttered, advanced, retreated."
4417,198-126831-0032.flac," somebody killed or something like that, you know? nothing like that ever happened in our family. the kings have always been respectable. perhaps it is emily."
4418,198-126831-0047.flac," and now it has almost, and has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death. we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn."
4419,198-126831-0025.flac," you'd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic simplicity, trying to pass plates and dropping them, dropping them whenever a woman looked at him, they say it's pitiful to see him. i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl."
4420,198-126831-0022.flac," they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country or we want sojourned and from which we must ever more be exiles. the world calls them, it's singers, and poets, and artists, and storytellers."
4421,198-126831-0034.flac," that's only my old apron said, felicity. i hung it there today when i was licking for that white-hands nest. oh, what shall we do? a carager may not be back for hours. i can't believe there's anything in the house. maybe it's only a peg bow and suggested dan."
4422,198-126831-0024.flac, he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed. the story girl kissed her fingertips. he's to him with the delightful adacity which was a part of her.
4423,198-126831-0006.flac," cessely, how old must we be before we can have a real bow? but sarah always denied it, so i'm inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself. patty distinguished himself by catching a rat."
4424,198-126831-0023.flac," as we sat there, the awkward man passed by, with the man passed by, with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side. he did not look like an awkward man, there in the heart of the maple woods."
4425,198-126831-0046.flac, we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation. we thought he never would stop.
4426,198-126831-0008.flac," very few cats have, and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for pottery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon. patty had a finer taste. the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking."
4427,198-126831-0004.flac," chancing accidentally i vowed over here certain of these secrets, i learned that sarah ray had named an ample for johnny price. and, cessli, truth you live, there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love."
4428,198-126831-0036.flac," no, it isn't peck- no, it isn't peck- it isn't peck- bowen. it's something that walks. i know as the story about a ghost said the story girl, the ruling passions strong, even in extremity. it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes."
4429,198-126831-0026.flac," if i put it off any longer, it will be too late. i'm growing so fast, and olivia says i'll have to wear ankle skirts next summer. if i begin to look grown up, he'll get frightened, frightened of me, and then i'll never find out the golden milestone mystery."
4430,198-126831-0029.flac, and i got back about 15 minutes ago. i sat down on the front doorsteps for a moment and all at once i heard a bell ringing in the house eight times. i-and i-i tell you i was scared. i made a bolt for the orchard and you won't catch me going near the house till your uncle roger comes home.
4431,198-126831-0035.flac," there was not a great deal of comfort in this. we were almost as much afraid of pegboin as we would be of any spectral visions. peter scoffed at the idea. pegboin wasn't in the house before your uncle roger locked it up, and how could she get in afterwards, he said."
4432,198-126831-0014.flac," i'd like to side, at two side, to side, to the city, but we'd come home tired and with all the milking to do, you boys better go alone. peter and i will attend the milking for one evening said uncle roger, you can all go."
4433,198-126831-0002.flac," with the highway man on a moonlit heath, and buscook's girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it. and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated,"
4434,198-126831-0003.flac, sessily and sarah ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine.
4435,198-126831-0021.flac," and that is the tragedy of life. on that day the gates of eden are shut behind them and age of gold is over. henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day, only if you who remain children at heart and heart can ever find that fair lost path again."
4436,198-126831-0018.flac," who pledged all comers in a golden cup, who put in a golden cup, in a golden cup with jewels bright. and if you drink of the cup with her, it said the story girl, her eyes glowing through the, through the emerald dusk about us, who put us, who does. you were never seen in the world again. you were whisked straight way to fairyland and lived there with the fairy bride."
4437,198-126831-0048.flac," i was so frightened. i wouldn't mind if he bluff, i would mind if he bluff, i would mind if he bluff once and have it done with it."
4438,198-126831-0037.flac," don't, cried sussly hysterically. don't, don't, don't you go on. don't you say another word? i can't bear it, don't you? the story girl didn't, but she had said enough."
4439,198-126831-0053.flac, but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and the felicity suggested that the sauce were full of peas.
4440,198-126831-0015.flac," i have an idea that a raspberry pie for tomorrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot. accordingly, after tea, we all set off armed with jugs and cups. felicity, thoughtful creature, also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her."
4441,198-126831-0007.flac," and being intolerably conceited about it. until sarah rae cured, and rae cured, rae cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat, and kissing him between the ears. then pat sneaked, objectively off his tail, and off his tail drooping."
4442,198-126831-0049.flac," i shall tell it, too. i don't care if the joke is as much as much as much on myself as anyone. a story is a story. no matter who it's on, i, i, i, i, i, no matter who it's on. but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown-ups always do it. and now i never will when i'm grown-up. i'll remember better."
4443,198-126831-0044.flac," there's no use asking the meaning of this, i suppose, at uncle roger, with the calm of this despair. i've gave up trying to fathom you young ones, peter, where's the key? what yarn have you been telling?"
4444,198-126831-0038.flac," all at once, something leaped from the bow of a tree, and all delighted before us, we split the air with the simultaneous shriek."
4445,198-126831-0039.flac, he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps.
4446,198-126831-0011.flac," focity tried and had the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe, a gorgeous compound"
4447,198-126831-0041.flac," was why and clear against the dark background of spruces. we were woefully tired, but we could not sit down because the grass was wreaking with doom. the family ghost only appears in daylight to the story girl."
4448,198-126831-0031.flac," well, here's the key, go and see for yourself,"" said peter. flucity had no intention of going and seeing. i think you boys ought to go, she said, retreating behind the defensive sex. you ought to be braver than girls."""
4449,198-126831-0040.flac," he was a strange fruit of animal, a questing beast. presently, he was a questing beast. presently, the moon rose, but this only made matters worse. he was only made matters worse. he was only made matters worse. the shadows had been still before. now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the bows. the old house, with its dreadful secret,"
4450,198-126831-0028.flac," and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring. when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge, it was the magical mystical time of between lights. after the west was the dapldool glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets."
4451,198-126831-0012.flac," the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked and jannits, and it's then it's thrifty soul, but that cake. like beauty was its own excuse. uncle roger ate three slices of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist."
4452,198-126831-0030.flac, there we stood in a huddled memorialized group. oh what an d-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-m-de-mexisting group. oh what an eerie place that orchard was. what shadows. what noises.
4453,198-126831-0043.flac, we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed to cressley. we didn't swarm to cressley yard just as uncle roger allided at the front door. he stared at us in the moonlight.
4454,198-126831-0017.flac," then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring, cold and pollucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies, and the storygirl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain quen, where a fair white lady dwelt."
4455,1963-147036-0017.flac," she got up to her feet and steadily and swayed toward him. in a second he was by her side, his arms about her. she made no resistance, but rather he felt, but rather he felt, but rather he felt a yielding toward him, which she had missed before. her pale face was up turned to his, and he stooped and kissed her."
4456,1963-147036-0028.flac," he shrugged his shoulders. you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet, which i was endeavoring to remove to a place of safety. tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it. i shall see the contents of this wallet tomorrow, he said."
4457,1963-147036-0024.flac," i want you to carry out your promise, mr. tarling said, mill burst smoothly. tarling stared at him. my promise, he said, what promise? to protect not only the evil doer,"
4458,1963-147036-0009.flac, he was tongue tied for a second because i love you. he said and his voice shook. it didn't did not seem to him that he was talking. the words came of their own volition. he had no more intention of telling her he loved her. indeed.
4459,1963-147036-0022.flac," but the occasion is a desperate one, and i cannot afford but ford to stand on ceremony, mr. tarling. tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager. one comprehensive hence the detective gave him."
4460,1963-147036-0033.flac," here. it was the girl's voice, surprisingly clear and steady. her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it towards the detective. there is a reason she said in a low voice."
4461,1963-147036-0013.flac," was the second shock of the evening. it was as though she had known it all along. he was on his knees by her side and his arm was about her shoulders, even before his brain had willed the act. my girl, my girl, he said gently, won't you please tell me?"
4462,1963-147036-0032.flac," tarling stepped back. he saw the malicious little smile on milbur's face and could have struck him down. miss ryder does not wish me to see what is in this case, he said."
4463,1963-147036-0019.flac," i'm afraid. oh, i'm afraid. crust her in his arms, his cheek against hers, his lips tingling with the caress of her hair. but there's nothing to be afraid of. nothing, he said eagerly. if you were as guilty as hell i would save you."
4464,1963-147036-0025.flac," tarling started. do you mean to say, he said, horsley? do you mean to accuse? i accuse nobody,"" said milbur, with a wide sweep of his hands. i merely suggest that both miss ryder and myself are in very serious trouble."
4465,1963-147036-0020.flac," if you were shielding somebody, if you were shielding somebody, i would shield them because i love you, ode. no, no she cried and pushed him back. both her little hands pressing against his chest. don't ask me, don't ask me. ask me. tarling swung round."
4466,1963-147036-0002.flac," she shook her head. oh, i'm not heard. she's not heard. she said wearily."
4467,1963-147036-0026.flac, and that you have it in your power to get a safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow. tarling took one step towards him and milbur shrank back. do you accuse miss writer of complicity in this murder he demanded? milbur smiled.
4468,1963-147036-0018.flac," oh, dad, oh, dad, he whispered. don't you realize that i love you, of you, of you, of you, and would give my life, oh, give my life to save you from unhappiness? won't you tell me everything, please? no, no, no, she murmur, murmur, murmur, with a little catch in her voice. please don't ask me."
4469,1963-147036-0014.flac," her head was still bent, and her voice was so low as to be almost inonable. tell you what, she asked. what you know of this business, he said, don't you realize how, don't you realize how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion?"
4470,1963-147036-0034.flac," milber had gone too far, tarling saw his face lengthened and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes. then, without further hesitation, he opened the paper and read. the first line took away his breath. the confession of odette ryder."
4471,1963-147036-0007.flac," she held out her hand, and he hesitated. after all, he had no right or title to this curious purse, purse, purse. he compromised by putting it on the table, and she did not attempt to take it. oh, dad, he said gently, and walked round to her."
4472,1963-147036-0031.flac," the catch is snapped open and he threw back, threw back, threw back the flap. then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girl's quivering face and read the terror in her eyes. no, no she cried, almost beside herself. no, for god's sake, no."
4473,1963-147036-0003.flac," she drew a chair to the table, chair to the table, chair to the table, and dropped her face upon her hands. and he stood, he stood, he stood by, embarrassed, almost terrified by this unexpected development. so you were the visitor, visitor, visitor on the bicycle, he said at last. i didn't suspect."
4474,1963-147036-0005.flac," she looked up at his words. i, on the bicycle, she asked, no, it was not i, not you. she shook her head. i was in the grounds."
4475,1963-147036-0011.flac," she did not shrink back. she did not look surprised. she showed no astonishment, whatever."
4476,1963-147036-0006.flac," i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up. i sucked the wallet, she said, listlessly. but i was not on the bicycle. who was it, he asked. she shook her head. may i shake her head? may i have that, please?"
4477,1963-147036-0023.flac," noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood. so you were the cyclist, eh? he said. that's right, said milbur. it is an exercise to which i am very partial. what do you want to ask tarling, alert, and watchful?"
4478,1963-147036-0027.flac," but it was an uneasy smile. i make no accusation, he said."
4479,1963-147036-0016.flac," and he dropped her hand and rose. when she looked up, he looked up, he looked up, she saw that his face was white and set. he walked to the door and unlocked it. i'm not going to ask you anymore,"" he said quietly. you know best why you came to me tonight."
4480,1963-147036-0008.flac," laying his hand on her shoulder. why don't you tell me? tell you what she asked for that looking up. tell me, limp, tell me, tell me all there is to be told he said, what said, i could help you. i want to help you. she looked up at him."
4481,1963-147036-0035.flac," good god, he muttered and read on."
4482,1963-147036-0010.flac," he had no more idea that he did love, he had did love, he had did love her than white side would have had. yet he knew he spoke the truth, and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips. if he effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him."
4483,1963-147036-0000.flac," the confession of odette ryder. he could only gaze in stupified silence. you, he said wonderingly. the thing, the thing. the girl was pale and her eyes never left his face. she nodded. yes, it is i, she said in a low voice."
4484,1963-147036-0015.flac," what business do you mean? he has you mean. he has a tated. the murder of thornton line? i know nothing of that. she made no response to that tender arm of his, but sat rigid. something in her attitude chilled him."
4485,1963-147036-0021.flac," there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him. milber, he said, between his teeth. milber smiled the other mockingly. i'm sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene."
4486,1963-147036-0012.flac," oh, that calm."
4487,1963-147036-0030.flac," and pulled from his pocket a chain at the end of which that and stangled a small bunch of keys. here is the key he said, unlock and read, can read tonight. tarling took the key in his hand, inserted it in first one tiny lock, and then in the other."
4488,1963-147036-0004.flac," it struck him at that moment that it was not an offense for odette rider to go up to her mother's house on a bicycle or even a bicycle or even a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers. if there was any crime at all,"
4489,1963-147036-0001.flac," you,"" he said again, and walked towards her. he held at his ear. he held at his ear. he held at his hand, and she gave him the wallet without a word. sit down,"" he said kindly. he thought she was going to faint. i hope i didn't hurt you. i had the slightest idea."

4530,1963-142393-0047.flac," now she was beginning to wand along the path up the hill, but adam would not move yet. he would not meet her too soon. he had set his heart on meeting her, and this assured loneliness. and now he began to fear."
4531,1963-142393-0027.flac," it's like as if it was a new strength to me, he said to himself, to love her and know as she loves me."
4532,1963-142393-0023.flac, we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manor or philosopher to his less complete formula.
4533,1963-142393-0034.flac," that it filled you with the new consciousness of the overarching sky, had a milder, more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day. adam's, this almost cloudless day. adam's doubts and fears melted under this influence"
4534,1963-142393-0055.flac," and they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell. adam was content and said nothing. it was dina who spoke first. adam, she said, it is the divine will."
4535,1963-142393-0049.flac," perhaps she had found complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any need of his love. unlove! pourtant. unlove! on the verge of a decision we all tremble, hope pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa with fluttering wings. but now at last she was very near."
4536,1963-142393-0042.flac," perhaps that's the last him before they come away, adam thought. i'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village. he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again."
4537,1963-142393-0041.flac," the little gray, gray, desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it, and as he came near, he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn."
4538,1963-142393-0002.flac," she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while, and i've no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes. she's told me what her mind is, and she's not a woman to say one thing and mean another."
4539,1963-142393-0028.flac, for she's better than i am.
4540,1963-142393-0029.flac," as if you could walk more fearless. when you've more trust in another,"
4541,1963-142393-0011.flac," and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to still it, though he may have to put his future in pawn. but what harm could he do by going to snowfield? dina could not be displeased with him for it?"
4542,1963-142393-0045.flac," she was much longer coming than he expected. he waited an hour at least, watching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer. at last he saw the little black figure,"
4543,1963-142393-0057.flac," to bear and do our heavenly father's will that i had lost to f***ing for. adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes. then we'll never part any more, dyna, till death parts us, and they kissed each other."
4544,1963-142393-0021.flac, which is sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain. surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible.
4545,1963-142393-0008.flac," if she had not felt this, she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort, but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him. as adam's confidence waned, his patience waned with it."
4546,1963-142393-0025.flac," the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point toward which that hard journey from snowfield 18 months ago had been leading him. tender and deep as his love for hedy had been,"
4547,1963-142393-0040.flac," he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out toward salomans in. with all his haste, it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off."
4548,1963-142393-0010.flac, it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips. for her presence reconciled him to her will. you perceive how it was. adam was hungering for the sight of dyna.
4549,1963-142393-0053.flac, what was in her mind. she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual munitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice. but the second time she looked round.
4550,1963-142393-0001.flac, i wish i'd asked her to write to me though he thought and yet
4551,1963-142393-0032.flac," would am, would am, and am, came inside of the grey town on the hillside, and looked searchingly toward the green valley below. for the first glimpse of this old fat-stroof near the ugly red mill, what, what, what, the scene looked less harsh in the soft,"
4552,1963-142393-0003.flac," i'll wait patiently. that was adam's wise resolution, resolution, resolution, and it throw, throw excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got."
4553,1963-142393-0019.flac," i should still know, still know, still know he was not the man to feel it for himself. he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said, evil is evil and sorrow, sorrow."
4554,1963-142393-0046.flac," coming from, come from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill. slowly, adam thought, but dino was really walking at her usual pace, with a light quiet step."
4555,1963-142393-0052.flac," she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place. dina, adam said again."
4556,1963-142393-0044.flac," because it was away from all eyes. no house, no big house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near. no presents, but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky."
4557,1963-142393-0016.flac, this morning brought with him new thoughts through the grey country. thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past. that is a base.
4558,1963-142393-0048.flac," lest he should startle her too much. yet, he thought, she's not one to be over startled. she's always so common quiet as if she was prepared for anything. what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill?"
4559,1963-142393-0022.flac, by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been in exchange for clear outline and the fulgent day. the growth of higher feeling within us is what our feeling within us is like the growth of faculty.
4560,1963-142393-0004.flac," but towards the middle of october, the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly, and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion. the weeks were unusually long. dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind."
4561,1963-142393-0014.flac," he had often been to oakburn and baxons that first journey to snowfield. but beyond oakburn, oakburn, the greystone walls, the broken country, the meager trees, seemed to be telling him a fresh,"
4562,1963-142393-0033.flac," october sunshine, then it had in the eagerness of early spring. and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions."
4563,1963-142393-0006.flac," but that sort of glow dies out. memory gets sadly diluted with time, and is not strong enough to revive us. adam was no longer so confident as he had been. he began to fear that perhaps dynastold life"
4564,1963-142393-0051.flac," adam was glad, glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover, he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him. he came within three paces of her and then said, dina."
4565,1963-142393-0026.flac, so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away. his love for dina was better and more precious to him. for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow.
4566,1963-142393-0005.flac," he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first strut. he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first strut. he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first strut that she offers him to care much about the taste of the second. he, after the second, he treads the earth with a very elastic step, as very elastic step, as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties."
4567,1963-142393-0056.flac," my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you. and this moment, now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love. i have a fullness of strength."
4568,1963-142393-0000.flac," adam understood dynastie's face to go away, and true hope rather than discouragement from it."
4569,1963-142393-0009.flac," and he thought he must write himself. he must ask dina not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful. he sat up late one night to write her a letter, but the next morning he burnt it. afraid of its effect."
4570,1963-142393-0030.flac, i've always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me.
4571,1963-142393-0024.flac, something like this sense of in large being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he wrote along in vivid recollection recollection recollection of the past.
4572,1963-142393-0013.flac," that he was already on his way to snowfield, that he was on horseback this time, for his hours were precious now, and he had borrowed jonathan burj's good nag for the journey. what king memories went along the road with him?"
4573,1963-142393-0050.flac," and adam rose from the and stonewall. it happened that just as he walked forward, dina had paused and turned around to look back at the village."
4574,1963-142393-0015.flac," the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart. but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time. ooooooh, rather, we who read it are no longer the same interpreters. and adam!"
4575,1963-142393-0018.flac," adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow, which had been brought so close to him. he could never thank god for another smith to misery. and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy in adam's behalf,"
4576,1963-142393-0043.flac, and seated himself on a loose stone against the low wall. to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and widening up the hill. he chose this spot almost at the top of the hill.
4577,1963-142393-0017.flac," in selfish, even a blasphemous spirit, with shrie choices and is thankful over the past evil that is blighted or crushed another, because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves."
4578,1963-142393-0031.flac, when you can't look to them nearest to you. when you're to them nearest to you to help you with a bit better thought.
4579,1963-142393-0035.flac," as the delicate, delicate, delicate, web-like clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him. he seemed to see dynas' gentle face assuring him with its looks alone, of all he longed to know."
4580,1963-142393-0012.flac, she had not forbidden him to go. she must surely expect that he would go before long. by the second sunday in october.
4581,1963-142393-0054.flac," what a look of yearning love it was. that was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong, turned on the strong dark eyed man. she did not start again at the side of him. she said nothing, but moved towards him so the disarm could class per round."
4582,1963-142393-0038.flac, to preach in a cottage there as her hamper was.
4583,1963-142393-0007.flac, would have too strong a grasp upon her.
4584,1926-147987-0031.flac," than from any experiences of his own. his zest and debauchery might wane, but never mrs. cutter's belief in it. the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on."
4585,1926-147987-0006.flac," anthony had turned to me eagerly. oh, would you, jim?"
4586,1926-147987-0012.flac," when i got home, i climbed in at the kitchen window. i was covered with blood from my nose and lip, but i was too sick to do anything about it. i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hat rack. lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts, went to sleep."
4587,1926-147987-0028.flac, she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home. cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices. he could have left her in the omaha hotel.
4588,1926-147987-0027.flac, and that cutter must have planned it so. the conductor told her the blackock train was due at way more 12 minutes after the kansas city train left. she saw once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to blackock without her.
4589,1926-147987-0003.flac, or the way he looked at her. i feel as if he's up to some of his tricks again.
4590,1926-147987-0029.flac," but apparently, it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible. mr. cutter will pay for this, mrs. burton. he will pay. mrs. cutter aboued, nodding her horse-like head and rolling her eyes."
4591,1926-147987-0022.flac," antonya was frightened, and was going home to stay for a while, she told mrs. cutter. it would be useless to interrogate the girl, for she knew nothing of what had happened. then mrs. cutter told her story."
4592,1926-147987-0010.flac," the man became insane. he stood over me, choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other, hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse. so this is what she's up to when i'm away, isn't? where is she, you nasty wolf?"
4593,1926-147987-0016.flac," she spent the whole morning bathing and pulsing, and pulsing, and pulsing me, and rubbing me with arnica. i heard antonya sobbing outside my door, but i asked grandma to send her away. i felt that i never wanted to see her again."
4594,1926-147987-0005.flac," maybe gem would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here night. i'd feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. i guess gem could take care of the silver and old usery notes as well as you could."
4595,1926-147987-0002.flac," as he had just put a new, put a new, put a new yellow lock on the front door. cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone."
4596,1926-147987-0019.flac," and had left again on the six o'clock train for denver that morning. the agent said his face was striped with corp plaster, and he carried his left hand in a sling. he looked so used up that the agent asked him what had happened to him since ten o'clock the night before."
4597,1926-147987-0009.flac," i held my breath in late absolutely still. a hand closed softly on my shoulder, and at the same moment i felt something hairy and clone-cented brushing my face."
4598,1926-147987-0025.flac," she saw him slip the twenty-dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket. that bill, she said, should have aroused her suspicions at once, but did not. the trains are never called at little junction towns. everybody knows when they come in."
4599,1926-147987-0024.flac," when he returned, he told her that he would have to stay overnight there."
4600,1926-147987-0004.flac," grandmother was apprehensive at once. i don't think it's right for you to stay there, feeling that way. i suppose it wouldn't be right for you to leave the place alone, either."
4601,1926-147987-0001.flac, she hesitated. and then told us how strangely mr. cutter had behaved before he went away.
4602,1926-147987-0014.flac," and one eye was swollen, and swollen, swollen, shut, and hideously discolored. grandmother said, we must have a doctor at once, but i am floored her as i had never bathed for anything before, not to send for him. i could stand anything i told her."
4603,1926-147987-0021.flac," there stood mrs. cutter, locked out, cutter, locked out, cutter, locked out, for she had no key to the new lock. her head trembling with rage. i advised her to control herself, or she would have a stroke."" grandmother said afterwards."
4604,1926-147987-0011.flac," where is she? under the bed, are you hussie? i know you, you know you're tricks. wait till i get at you. i'll fix this rat you've got in here. he's caught all right. so long as cutter had me, had me by the throat, there was no chance for me at all."
4605,1926-147987-0026.flac, mr. cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off.
4606,1926-147987-0008.flac," i was only half awake, but i decided that he might take the cutter's silver, whoever he was."
4607,1926-147987-0023.flac," she and her husband had started home from omaha together the morning before. they had to stop over several hours, hours, and way more junction to catch the black hawk train."
4608,1926-147987-0007.flac," the third night i spent at the cutters, i woke suddenly, with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut. everything was shut. everything was still, however, and i must have gone to sleep again immediately."
4609,1926-147987-0017.flac, she had let me in for all this disgustingness. grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antenia. but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude.
4610,1926-147987-0018.flac," if the story once got abroad, i would never hear the last of it. i could well imagine what the old men down at the drugstore would do with such a theme."
4611,1926-147987-0015.flac," she seemed to understand, though i was too faint and miserable, miserable, miserable to go into explanations. when she took a minute,"
4612,1926-147987-0013.flac," her cry of her cry of her cry of fright awakened me. truly, i was a battered object. as she helped me to my room, i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. my lip was cut and stood out like a snout. my nose looked like a big blue plum."
4613,1926-147987-0000.flac," the day after the cutters left, antonya came over to see us. grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled, seemed troubled, and distracted. you've got something on your mind, antonya, she said anxiously."
4614,1926-147987-0030.flac," certainly, cutter like cutter like cutter like to have his wife think him a devil. in some way, in some way, in some way, he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her sterical nature. perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement."
4615,1926-147987-0020.flac," my own grum grum grum grum mits have been treated so badly that i never saw them again. grum mother burned them in the cutter's kitchen range. while antonya was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it, the front doorbell rang violently."
4616,1926-147979-0018.flac," while the milado sat rocking himself, his head-thrum back, his yellow face lifted. it troubled eyelids, never-what sluttering. he was born in the far south, on the darno-waldarno plantation, where the spirit, if not the fact, of slavery persisted."
4617,1926-147979-0050.flac," tiny sodorball was trim and slender, with lively little feet and pretty ankles. she wore her dress very short. she was quicker in speech, lighter in movement and manner than the other girls. mary dusek was broad and"
4618,1926-147979-0027.flac, talk a little while and then leave the room. he heard the door close after them. he crept up the front windows and stuck his head in. there was no one there. he could always detect the presence of anyone in a room.
4619,1926-147979-0001.flac," but in black hawk, the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pitched, frozen down to the bare stock."
4620,1926-147979-0002.flac," through january and february, i went to the river with the harling. the harlings on clear nights, and we skated up to the big island and made bomb fires on the frozen sand. but by march, the ice was rough and choppy."
4621,1926-147979-0004.flac," the wind from without made waves in the long carpet. a coal stove glowed at either end of the room, and the grand piano in the middle stood open. there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night."
4622,1926-147979-0029.flac," he thought about that, but he pulled in his other foot. through the dark he found his way to the thing, to its mouth. he touched it softly, and it answered softly, kindly. he shivered and stood still."
4623,1926-147979-0012.flac," who were to play their next week, who next week, and that mary anderson was having a great success in a winter's tale in london. the door from the office, who the office, the office opened, and johnny gardner came in, directing blind or no, he would never consent to be led."
4624,1926-147979-0051.flac," she looked bold and resourceful and unscrupulous, and she was all of these. they were handsome girls, had the fresh color in their country upbringing, and in their eyes that brilliancy, which is called bino metaphor alas."
4625,1926-147979-0052.flac," the light of youth. darno played until his manager came and shut the piano. before he left us, he showed us his gold watch which struck the hours, and a topaz ring, given him by some russian nobleman who delighted in negro melodies."
4626,1926-147979-0038.flac," and he were gloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers. in the middle of a crashing, and in the middle of a crashing waltz, darno suddenly began to play softly, and turning to one of the men who stood behind him whispered."
4627,1926-147979-0021.flac," that she hid him away from people. all the dainty she brought down from the big house were for the blind child, and she beat and cuffed her other children whenever she found them teasing him. we're trying to get his chicken bone away from him. he began to talk early."
4628,1926-147979-0010.flac," he was a dapper, little irishman, very vain, homely as a monkey, with friends everywhere, and a sweetheart and every port, like a sailor. i did not know all the men who were sitting about, but i recognized furniture salesmen from kansas city."
4629,1926-147979-0042.flac, she protested. she'd be awful mad if you were to come out here and dance with us. mrs. gardiner's an omaha girl.
4630,1926-147979-0053.flac," and had heard darno play in new orleans. f! f! f! at last he tapped his way upstairs, after bowing to everybody in darsal and had gone happy. i walked home with antenna. we were so excited that we tried to go to bed."
4631,1926-147979-0036.flac," several teachers experimented with him. they found he sub-with him. they found he had absolute pitch and a remarkable memory. as a very young sun-chowd, he could repeat after a fashion. any composition that was played for him, no matter how many wrong notes he struck, he never lost the intention of the passage."
4632,1926-147979-0013.flac," his yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. good evening, gentlemen! no ladies here? good evening, gentlemen!"
4633,1926-147979-0007.flac," she seemed indifferent to her possessions, was—her possessions was not half so solicitous about—about them as her friends were. she was tall, dark, severe, with something indian-like and the rigid immobility of her face. her manner was cold, and she talked little."
4634,1926-147979-0032.flac," he seemed to know that it must be done with the fingers and not with the fists or the feet. he approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct and coupled himself to it, as if he knew it was to piece him out and make a whole creature of him."
4635,1926-147979-0035.flac," leaped forward in the dark, struck his head on the open window and fell screaming and bleeding to the floor. he, bleep bleep, he had what his mother called a fit. the doctor came and gave him opium. when sam, sam, lee samson was well again. his young mistress led him back to the piano."
4636,1926-147979-0023.flac," he was docile and obedient, but when he was six years old he began to run away from home, always taking the same direction. he fought his way through the lilacs along the boxwood hedge."
4637,1926-147979-0049.flac, anthony seemed frightened at first.
4638,1926-147979-0028.flac," he put one foot over the window sill and straddled it. his mother, mother, mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mast if he ever found him on him, on him meddling. samson had got too near the mast of skinnel once, and had felt his terrible breath on his face."
4639,1926-147979-0043.flac," and your tony and your mary. have a good, you all straight, and your o'reilly and the others began to pile the chairs on the tables. johnny gardiner ran in from the office. easy, boys, easy. he entreated them. he'll wake the cook, and there'll be the double to pay for me."
4640,1926-147979-0046.flac," and on his watch case, doubtless on his heart, too. he was an affectionate little man, and he thought his wife, a wonderful woman. he knew that without her, he would hardly be more than a clerk in some other man's hotel. add a word from kirkpatrick."
4641,1926-147979-0041.flac," what's the matter with you, girls? dancing out here by yourselves when there's a room full of loans and men on the other side of the partition. introduce me, what's the need for me to your friends, tiny? the girls still laughing, were trying to escape. tiny looked alarmed."
4642,1926-147979-0008.flac," guests felt that they were receiving, not conferring, a favor when they stayed at her house. even the smartest traveling men were flattered when mrs. gardner stopped to chat with them for a moment."
4643,1926-147979-0009.flac," two classes, those who had seen mrs. gardner's diamonds, two, and those who had not. when i stole into the parlor, and sinned kirkpatrick, marshall fieldsman,"
4644,1926-147979-0019.flac," when he was three weeks old, he had an illness which left him totally blind."
4645,1926-147979-0020.flac," his mother, a bucsome young negro, went she was a long-dressed for the dernos, concluded that her blind baby was not right in his head and she was ashamed of him. she loved him devotedly, but he was so ugly with his sunken eyes and his fidgets."
4646,1926-147979-0034.flac," he was feeling out the pattern that lay already made on the big and little keys. when he paused for a moment, because the sound was wrong and he wanted another, miss nelly wanted another, miss nelly wanted another, miss nelly spoke softly. he rolled about in a spasmin of terror."
4647,1926-147979-0024.flac," whenever she caught him, whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin, she whipped him unmercifully and told him what dreadful things old mr. darno would do to him, if he ever found him near the big house. but the next time samson had a chance, he ran away again."
4648,1926-147979-0031.flac," it was cold and hard, and like nothing else in his black universe. he went back to its mouth, began at one end of the keyboard, and felt his way down into the mellow thunder as far as he could go."
4649,1926-147979-0015.flac," he had the negro head to, almost no head at all. nothing behind the ears, the folds of neck under a closed, clipped wool."
4650,1926-147979-0037.flac," as piano playing, it was perhaps abominable. but as music, it was something real, vitalized by a sense of rhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses. that not only filled his dark mind, but worried his body incessantly."
4651,1926-147979-0026.flac," though it did not occur to her, then he might have more of it, might have more of it, then other children. one day, samson was standing thus while miss nally was playing her lesson to her music master. the windows were open."
4652,1926-147979-0048.flac," whenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath, he would boom out softly. who's that going back on me? one of these city gentlemen i bet. now you girls."
4653,1926-147979-0003.flac, at our comfortable hotel. mrs. harling had known dierno for years.
4654,1926-147979-0047.flac," over the piano and began to draw the dance music out of it, over music out of it, while the perspiration shown on his short wool and on his uplifted face."
4655,1926-147979-0011.flac," a drug man, and willie o'reilly, who traveled for a jewelry, a jewelry house, and sold musical instruments. the talk was all about good and bad hotels, actors and actresses and musical protégés. i learned that mrs. garner had gone to omaha to hear booth and bear it."
4656,1926-147979-0025.flac," and went towards the window. she saw this hideous little pick-in-any dressed in an old piece of sacking, standing in the open-and-space between the hollyhawk rose. his body rocking automatically, his blind face lifted."
4657,1926-147979-0016.flac," when he was sitting or standing still, he swayed back and forth incessantly, like a rocking toy. at the piano, he swayed in time to the music, and when he was not playing, his body kept up this motion, like an empty mow grinding on."
4658,1926-147979-0022.flac, and his man and his man he said he wasn't all wrong. she named him samson because he was blind. but on the plantation he was known as yellow and known as yellow martha's simple child.
4659,1926-147979-0030.flac," then he began to feel it all over, ran his fingertips along the slippery sides and braced the carved legs, tried to get some conception of its shape and size, of the space it occupied in primeval night."
4660,1926-147979-0040.flac," springing down, he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining room. tiny and lena, antonya and mary and dusek were waltzing in the middle of the floor. they separated and fled towards the kitchen. and fled towards the kitchen, giggling. kirkpatrick caught tiny by the elbows."
4661,1926-147979-0017.flac," now gentlemen, i expect you all got grand voices. seems like we might have some good old plantation songs tonight. the men gathered around him as he began to play my old kentucky home. they sang one negro melody after another."
4662,1926-147979-0014.flac," we're going to have a little music. some of you, gentlemen, are going to play for me this evening? it was the soft, amiable negro voice, like those i remembered from early childhood, with the note of dossile subservience in it."
4663,1926-147979-0044.flac," it's a fact boys, he said confidently."
4664,1926-147979-0000.flac," winter, winter lies too long in country towns, hangs on until it is stale and chubby, old and solid. on the farm, the weather was the great fact, and the fares went on underneath it, as the steams creep under the ice."
4665,1926-147979-0006.flac," he was a popular fellow, but no manager. mrs. gardener was admittedly the best dressed woman in black, woman in black, woman in black hawk, drove the best horse, and had a smart trap and a little white and gold slay."
4666,1926-147979-0033.flac," that lay under the bones of his pinched conical little skull, definite as animal desires. the door opened, miss nellie and her music masters stood behind it, but blind samson, who was so sensitive to presences, did not know they were there."
4667,1926-147979-0039.flac," somebody dance in in there. he jerked his bullet head towards the dining room. i hear little feet. girls, i suspect. incent kirkpatrick mounted the chair and peeped over the trancem."
4668,1926-147979-0045.flac," oh, we'll make it all right with molly. get your backup, johnny. molly was mrs. gardner's name, of course."
4669,1926-147979-0005.flac," for mrs. gardener, fgardener had gone to omaha for a week. johnny had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent-minded. it was mrs. gardener who ran the business, business, and looked after everything. her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travelers."
4670,1926-143879-0032.flac, had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame morale that they should take a little pilgrimage to the east. madame morale remarked that her friend was restless.
4671,1926-143879-0028.flac," set her right again. she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed, even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets, the moving crowds, the hurrying cabs, the lighted shops, the flaring stalls, the dark"
4672,1926-143879-0029.flac, she made her way down to rome without touching it florence.
4673,1926-143879-0025.flac, it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions. isabel watched the train move away? she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews.
4674,1926-143879-0019.flac," isabelle had developed less, however, than lily had thought likely developed. to lily's understanding, being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties, intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides."
4675,1926-143879-0046.flac," and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini, madame moral on this occasion remaining in rome."
4676,1926-143879-0024.flac," was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her with her thoughts. as this happened very often, sometimes it appeared to mrs. ludd, ludd, ludd, ludd, that she had lost her courage. so uncanny, a result of so exhilarating and incident as inheriting a fortune,"
4677,1926-143879-0012.flac," lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july, and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows."
4678,1926-143879-0005.flac," since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always rained. she wished rather to forstall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face, this attempt gave her plenty to do."
4679,1926-143879-0018.flac," on the whole, as i have said, she had fallen from high communion with the probability."
4680,1926-143879-0030.flac," in the september previous, had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer."
4681,1926-143879-0006.flac," grave, she found herself, and positively more weighted, as by the experience of the laps of the year she had spent in seeing the world."
4682,1926-143879-0021.flac," we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests, whether inferior or not to those she might have affected in her native land,"
4683,1926-143879-0023.flac," but lily knew nothing of these discriminations, and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anticlimax, and impression confirmed by the fact that it is about silence about mr. osmond, for instance."
4684,1926-143879-0037.flac," she considered, with a presumption of youth, that immorality differing from her own must be inferior to it."
4685,1926-143879-0017.flac, which had an elegant conservatory and was just around the corner from her own. add another.
4686,1926-143879-0016.flac, mrs. love those mental motions were sufficiently various.
4687,1926-143879-0020.flac," the trophies. lilies' conception of such achievements was extremely vague, the trope egg. but this is exactly what she had expected the trope, the trope expected the trope expected of isabel, to give it form and body."
4688,1926-143879-0038.flac, an occasional lapse from candor in the candor in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception.
4689,1926-143879-0027.flac, and used in square with a long way from piccadilly. but isidao performed in delhi. but isidao performed in delhi. but isidao performed in the journey with in the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers. and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when in an obliging policeman easily
4690,1926-143879-0036.flac, a consummation the more desirable.
4691,1926-143879-0011.flac," the little love those had not yet, even from the american point of view."
4692,1926-143879-0008.flac, if her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present.
4693,1926-143879-0034.flac," isabel found much to interest her in these countries, though madame mural continued to remark, that even among the most classic sites,"
4694,1926-143879-0022.flac," then that she didn't wish to speak, speak, speak. it was more romantic to say nothing, and drinking deep in secret of romance. she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice, and she would have been to close that rare volume forever."
4695,1926-143879-0040.flac," having tages to hear. she had once or twice had a positive scare. since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend,"
4696,1926-143879-0031.flac, in henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mr. bantling that he would soon come over.
4697,1926-143879-0039.flac, and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard. she had not heard of everything that was very plain.
4698,1926-143879-0045.flac," during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame moral, in whose house she had gone to lodge, mean it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day. when the last of april came,"
4699,1926-143879-0010.flac," she had left her husband behind her, but had brought her children to him isabelle now played with equal, magnificent, and tenderness, the part of maiden aunt. mr. ludlow."
4700,1926-143879-0026.flac, the early dusk of november afternoon had already closed in. the street lamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red.
4701,1926-143879-0044.flac," deep and memorable as these emotions had remained. she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome. a few days after her arrival,"
4702,1926-143879-0007.flac, a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at garden court a couple of years before.
4703,1926-143879-0009.flac," with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field, we are already acquainted."
4704,1926-143879-0014.flac," and with costly ceremonies. by lily. but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel, who in these days made"
4705,1926-143879-0035.flac, her character had revealed itself.
4706,1926-143879-0015.flac," mrs. ludlow sacrificed, as i say, to paris. yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar. and after her husband had joined her, found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations."
4707,1926-143879-0033.flac," but she added that she herself had always been consumed with a desire to visit athens and constantinople. the two ladies, accordingly, embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey, in egypt."
4708,1926-143879-0041.flac," but it stood for a high watermark in the remark in the ab and flow of confidence. madame moural had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow, it immediately begins to decline. there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less."
4709,1926-143879-0013.flac," and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons. they had afterwards reached the french capital, which was worshipped."
4710,1926-143879-0042.flac," a stationary affection in other words, was it in other words, was it in other words, was impossible. it must move one way or the other. however that might be, the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic, which was more active than it had ever been."
4711,1926-143879-0043.flac," i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo, where as she stood among the broken columns at the acropolis where fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamis."
4712,1926-143879-0004.flac," too troubled for attention, she moved in a vain circle."
4713,1926-143879-0003.flac," the tall window was open and though its green shutters were partially drawn, the bright air of the garden had come in through a broad interstitial and filled the room with warmth."
4714,1926-143879-0000.flac, chapter 31.
4715,1926-143879-0001.flac," our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late springtime, shortly after her return to the pleusokristentini."
4716,1926-143879-0002.flac, to social uses. and there was that in her expression and attitude.
4717,1867-154075-0022.flac," i don't know,"" said ronnicky dune, smiling faintly at the coolness of the other. what do you think about it? meaning that i'm liable to put an end to your stay? maybe. tush, tush."
4718,1867-154075-0030.flac," relief, wonder, and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the eyes of john mark. carolyn, you came for that? suddenly, he laughed heartily, but there was a trimmer of emotion in that laughter."
4719,1867-154075-0037.flac," heavens, man, i can't persuade her to go with a stranger at night. surely you see that. i'll do the persuading,"" said ronniki doon, calmly. and when you're on the streets with the girl,"
4720,1867-154075-0004.flac," the time had almost come for one desperate attempt to escape, and he was ready to shoot to kill. a moment of pause had come. a pause which, in the imagination of veronica,"
4721,1867-154075-0000.flac, 12. the strange bargon. raniqi drew is gun-and-weighted. good said the man of the sneer. go ahead. it was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks.
4722,1867-154075-0013.flac," although you were glad to see him, you warned him that it was dangerous to play with fire. fire being me. do i gather the drift to the story fairly well? finally, you have him worked up to the right pitch."
4723,1867-154075-0007.flac," the man grouted some retort and left, closing the door heavily behind him. while ronniki dune, breathed, freed, freed, freed, freed again for the first time. now, said the man of the sneer, tell me the whole of it, ruth. ronniki said his teeth."
4724,1867-154075-0015.flac," yes, said the girl unevenly. that is—ah, murmured the man of the sneer. you seem rather relieved that i have guessed he left the house. in that case, raniqi dune had held the latch of the door turn back for some time."
4725,1867-154075-0021.flac," though i wasn't playing my hand at eve's dropping, i couldn't help but hear you, partner. the man of the sneer looked him over leisurely. western, he said, at last, decidedly western. are you, though i the last, decidedly western? are you staying long in the east, my friend?"
4726,1867-154075-0008.flac," had the clever devil guessed at the truth so easily? had he sent his follower away merely to avoid having it known that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved? go on, the leader was repeating, let me hear the whole truth."
4727,1867-154075-0018.flac," as if she were preparing herself for the explosion. ""'you don't have to put up your hands,' said ronnicky dune, wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer. he had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance.'"
4728,1867-154075-0023.flac," i suppose ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot about what a terrible fellow i am. but i don't use poison, and i don't—i don't—i don't kill with mysterious x-rays. i am, as you see, a very quiet and ordinary sort."
4729,1867-154075-0026.flac," i'd kill you like a snake stranger, which i mostly think you are. step light and step quick when i talk. certainly said the other, bowing, i am entirely at your service. he turned a little to ruth."
4730,1867-154075-0043.flac," a great rage came into the eyes of john mark. a great wonder came into the eyes of the westerner. where did john mark get his sudden strength? well, said ronniki, we've shaken hands, and now you can do what you please."
4731,1867-154075-0011.flac," so he came in exactly that way, like a- that way, like a robber, but really only to keep a trist with his lady-love. a pretty story, a true romance."
4732,1867-154075-0041.flac," you're free to do anything you want to get either of us. will you shake on that? for a moment, the leader hesitated. then his fingers closed over the extended hand of roniky dune. and clamp down on them like so many steel wires contracting."
4733,1867-154075-0016.flac," now he pushed it open and stepped out. he was stepped out. he was only barely in time, for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction since there was only one hiding place in the room."
4734,1867-154075-0042.flac," at the same time, a flush of excitement and fierceness passed over the face of john mark and mark. ronnichidun, taken utterly by surprise, was at a great disadvantage."
4735,1867-154075-0009.flac," i, i, i, stammered the, i stammered the girl and she could say no more. the man of the, the, the sneer left unpleasantly. let me help you. it was somebody you met somewhere."
4736,1867-154075-0044.flac," sit down, leave the room, anything."
4737,1867-154075-0017.flac," he was brought up with a shock by the sight of roniky's big cold, held at the hip, and covering him with absolute certainty. ruth tolliver did not cry out, but every muscle in her face and body seemed to contract."
4738,1867-154075-0032.flac," and he brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and cool and cool. very well then, it seems i've made an ass of myself. but i'll try to make up for it. now what about carolyn?"
4739,1867-154075-0040.flac," suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain,"" said ronnicky. you send for carolyn smith. i'm to do the persuading to get her out of the house. we're safe to the doors of the house. the minute we step into the street,"
4740,1867-154075-0028.flac," my name is john mark. i'm dune. some call me ronniki dune. i'm glad to know you, ronniki dune. i imagine that name fits you. now tell me the story of why you came to this house. of course it wasn't to see a girl."
4741,1867-154075-0045.flac," that brought us start from john mark, and mark, and a flash of eagerness, but he repressed the idea after a single glance at the girl, girl, girl. we've shaken hands, he admitted slowly, as though just realizing the full extent of the meaning of that act."
4742,1867-154075-0014.flac, you show him that it is possible.
4743,1867-154075-0027.flac," i see that you have a most determined cavalier. i suppose he'll instantly abduct you and and sweep you away from beneath my eyes. she made a vag gesture of denial. go ahead,"" said the leader. by the way."
4744,1867-154075-0029.flac," you're wrong. it was. ah! in spite of himself the face of john mark wrinkled with pain and suspicious rage. i came to see a girl, and her name i figure is carolyn smith."
4745,1867-154075-0020.flac," i congratulate you on your good taste. a regular apollo, my dear ruth, he turned, turned, turned back to ronniki dune. and i suppose you have overheard our entire conversation. the whole lot of it said ronniki."
4746,1867-154075-0039.flac," i ain't terrible backward with the trigger finger john mark. not finger john mark. not finger john mark. not that i figure on bragging, but i want you to pick good men for my trail and tell them to step soft. is that square?"
4747,1867-154075-0036.flac," the gun, partner. and, if you couldn't get the girl, but she how absurd the whole thing is, ronnicky dune? i send for the girl. i request her to go down with you to the street and take a walk, because you wish to talk to her."
4748,1867-154075-0019.flac, he knew every line in that sharp profile. thank you.
4749,1867-154075-0025.flac," you'd murder me if i took another step, ask the man of the sneer, and a contemptuous, and sardonic expression flitted across his face for the first time. i'd sure blow you full of lead,"" said ronnicky, fervently."
4750,1867-154075-0001.flac," that dropped him into the coal bin. ben. did he get coal dust on his shoes? right. and he didn't have sense enough to wipe it off. an amateur, a rank amateur, i told you, said the man of the sneer with satisfaction."
4751,1867-154075-0035.flac," this carolyn smith may be a person of great value to me. i have no doubt she is, but i got a good argument."
4752,1867-154075-0003.flac, and where did it lead? right to this room. ronnicky stepped from among the smooth silks.
4753,1867-154075-0034.flac," yes, i have a curious stock of useless information. well, you're right. i'm going to try to get her back to bill. but you can't expect me to ascend to that. i sure do. and why?"
4754,1867-154075-0024.flac," ronnicky, doon, doon, smile again. you just obliged me, partner. he replied in his own soft voice. just stay away from the walls of the room. don't even sit down. stay and right where you are."
4755,1867-154075-0010.flac, you smiled so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here. the only way he could get in was by stealth. is that right?
4756,1867-154075-0033.flac," leave this house, and take a ride or a walk with me, leave me. as much as that, if you have to talk to her, look to her, why not do the talking here? i don't know,"" replied ronnicky dune. i figure she'd think too much about you all the time."
4757,1867-154075-0006.flac," you fool, they simply grew dim when they got to this door. i've been here for some time. go back and tell them to- you'd a hunt some more. go up to the attic and search there. that's the place an amateur would most- most- most likely hide."
4758,1867-154075-0012.flac," my dear girl, john began ruth tolliver, her voice shaking, tush! you broke in as smoothly as ever. let me tell the story for you, and spare you your blushes."
4759,1867-154075-0038.flac," do you suppose i'll rest idle and let you walk away with her? once we're outside of the house, mark, said ronnicky dune, i don't ask no favors. let your men come on."
4760,1867-154075-0031.flac," the perfect torture, which had been ringing the soul of the man with the sneer, projected through the laughter. i asked your pardon, my dear,"" said john mark to ruth. i should have guessed. you found him. he confessed why he was here. you took pity on him."
4761,1867-154075-0005.flac, that's a likely story. i can show you the tracks.
4762,1867-154075-0002.flac," you followed his trail. up the stairs to the kitchen, and down the hall, and up to harry's room. wooo! already knew he'd gone there. but he left that room again, and came down the hall. yes?"
4763,1867-154071-0004.flac, go on back to sleep. i'll call you again if anything happens.
4764,1867-154071-0016.flac," she wore a black straw hat, turned back from her face, with a single big red flower at the side of it."
4765,1867-154071-0008.flac," and he grew pale at the thought. partner said ronniki-dun, and he said ronniki-dun, if they are trying to keep her away from us, they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days. ain't that right?"
4766,1867-154071-0019.flac," ronniki, ronniki, ronniki, dune followed that glance and he saw all hidden save a profile of the face."
4767,1867-154071-0025.flac," what a contrast between the contrast between the contrast between the ascent and the descent. he had literally flown down. now his heel feels clumped out as slow and regular death march as he came back to the room. when the room, when the room, when greg opened the door,"
4768,1867-154071-0005.flac, ghost hours of the early morning. they did not relax their vigil.
4769,1867-154071-0022.flac, the girl hesitated a moment.
4770,1867-154071-0007.flac, by this time the nerves that the two watchers were shattered were shattered by the constant strain and the monotonous notness few from the front window was beginning to madden them it's proof that she ain't yonder said bill greg
4771,1867-154071-0021.flac," the nose was hooked, like the nose of a bird of prey. the eyes were long and slanting, like those of an oriental. the face was thin, almost fleshless, so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a death's head."
4772,1867-154071-0002.flac, here they took up the vigil.
4773,1867-154071-0027.flac," now, in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood, he had lost blood, he had lost her, and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair."
4774,1867-154071-0035.flac," not you, bill. you're going to buck up and go ahead full steam."
4775,1867-154071-0030.flac, said bill gregg faintly. now we hit the back trail and forget all of this. said all about this. he added with a faint attempt it said cynicism. i've just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine. that's all.
4776,1867-154071-0041.flac," that sent out the girl with the exact, exact, that's exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and speak to her when you seen her. bill, with that girl told you didn't come out of her own head. it come out of the head of the jan across the way. when you turned your back on her,"
4777,1867-154071-0001.flac," found a big, double room that ran across the whole length of the house. from the back, it looked down on the light's glimmering on the black east river and across to the flare of brooklyn. to the left, the whole arc of the 59th street bridge was exposed."
4778,1867-154071-0012.flac," there stood carolyn smith in the door of the house. she closed the door behind her and walked to the top of the steps, paused there, and looked up and down the street. bill gregg groaned."
4779,1867-154071-0017.flac," the same distinction between their clothes was in their faces, the finally modeled prettiness of her features, actors, actors, and the big, careless chiseling of the features of the features of bill greg. ronikidun did not wonder that after her first fear, her gesture was one of disdain and surprise."
4780,1867-154071-0010.flac," one week, was decided on as a fair test. if, at the end of that time, time, time, carolyn smith did not come out of the house across the street, they could conclude that she did not stay there."
4781,1867-154071-0028.flac," after that, he did not move so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply. his legs were twisted awkwardly, sprawling across the floor in front of him, one long arm dragged down toward the floor."
4782,1867-154071-0011.flac," peering through the slit between the drawn curtains, which sheltered him from being observed at his spying. when he called out softly, the sound brought greg, with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window. there could be no shadow of a doubt about it."
4783,1867-154071-0029.flac," as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor as labor hardened hands, his chin was fallen against his breast. when ron, ron, ron, he'd doon crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder he did not look up. it's ended."
4784,1867-154071-0044.flac, shake said roniky dune. that's the sort of talk i wanted to hear.
4785,1867-154071-0043.flac," you gotta get that gent i seen grinning from the window. grining? ask bill gregg? grinding his teeth and starting from his- use chair? was the skunk laughing at me? sure, every minute. bill gregg groaned. i'll smash every bone in his ugly head."
4786,1867-154071-0037.flac," do you know what she said? well, bill greg? she- well, bill greg, she says, i don't remember any- do you- any such name? that took the wind out of me. i only had enough left to say."
4787,1867-154071-0014.flac," and so swift was that descent, that when the girl idling down the steps across the street came onto the sidewalk, bill greg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her."
4788,1867-154071-0031.flac," said ronnyky dune, dune, dune. bill, look me in the eye and tell me, man to man, the cheerleyer. he added, can you ever be, can you ever be, can you ever be happy without her, man? the cruelty of that speech made greg flush."
4789,1867-154071-0000.flac, chapter 8. 2 operations
4790,1867-154071-0023.flac," for she made a slight, he made a slight outward gesture with one hand. if this were in her mind, however, it vanished instantly. she turned with a shutter and hurried away down the street."
4791,1867-154071-0036.flac, bill greg smiled sourly.
4792,1867-154071-0013.flac," snatched his hat and plunged through the door, and ronik he heard the brief thunder of his- srevus- srevus feet down the first flight of stairs. then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing."
4793,1867-154071-0042.flac," she looked like she'd run after you and try to explain. but the fear of that fellow up in the window was too much for her, and she didn't dare. bill?"
4794,1867-154071-0015.flac," for never had the miners seem so clumsily big and gaunt. never had his clothes seem so unpressed and shapeless, while his soft grey hat, to which he still clung religiously, appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast to the slim prettiness of the girl."
4795,1867-154071-0026.flac," ronnicky dune blinked and drew in a deep breath at the side of the poor fellow's face. greg had known before that he truly loved, really loved, really loved this girl whom he had never seen."
4796,1867-154071-0032.flac," said greg, huskily. ain't there? ain't there? that's where you and me don't agree."
4797,1867-154071-0009.flac," it's just about our last chance, bill. we've done our hunting pretty near as well as we could. if we don't land or this trip, i'm about ready to give up."
4798,1867-154071-0039.flac," and then she looks back over her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house. do you know why she looked back over her shoulder? just for the reason i told you. no, bill. there was a gent standing up there at the window watching her and how she acted."
4799,1867-154071-0020.flac," what a face it was. never in his life had ronik yidun seen a man who, in one instant, filled him, instant, filled him with such fear and hatred, such loathing and such fear, such loathing and such dread, such scorn and such terror."
4800,1867-154071-0038.flac," the gent that was writing those papers to the correspondence school to you from the west. the one you sent your picture to and sent my picture to, she says, and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet. your mad, she says."
4801,1867-154071-0006.flac," apparently, the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality. not assigned that vicarillon smith appeared, even during the second day."
4802,1867-154071-0040.flac, he's the one who's kept her in that house.
4803,1867-154071-0018.flac," he went a long, slow, step closer to her, with both his hands outstretched."
4804,1867-154071-0034.flac, ain't that something done? after you've done all that?
4805,1867-154071-0033.flac," look at the way things have gone. you start out with the photograph of a girl. now we follow her, founder name."
4806,1867-154071-0003.flac," bill greg shook his head. that's not the one, un-billin. she's all different. a pile different, ronniki. ronniki's side."
4807,1867-154071-0024.flac," as for bill greg, he bore himself straight as a business soldier and came back across the pavement, but it was the erectness of a soldier who had met with a crushing defeat, and only preserves an aft defeat, and only preserves an aft defeat, and only preserves an outward resolution, while all the spirit within is crushed."
4808,1867-148436-0026.flac," the brute has gone lame, you see."
4809,1867-148436-0020.flac," and set about frying ham and making coffee. this, with crackers, formed the meal. he watched nash eat for a moment of solemn silence, and then the foreman looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster. let me in on the joke, son. nothing."
4810,1867-148436-0010.flac," what you say cuts both ways, steve. this filler barred."
4811,1867-148436-0009.flac, and you said over him like a hen. and like a hen. they look like eggs. they feel like eggs. but they don't never hatch. that's the way with your ideas. they look alright. they sound alright. but they don't mean nothing. so long.
4812,1867-148436-0013.flac," he was weary, like his horse, torce, torce, and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed. he let the pony go on at the same tireless jog, clinging like a bulldog to the trail. about midday"
4813,1867-148436-0045.flac," but the point is, i didn't see it. do you mind if i turn, if i turn in on that bunk over there? help yourself, said the boy. what time do you want me to wake you up? never mind. i wake up automatic. so long, bud."
4814,1867-148436-0008.flac," only it takes about three days to get to eldera. maybe you think that interests me. it don't. logan overlooked this rejoinder saying, is it his scalp you're after? your ideas are like nest eggs, logan."
4815,1867-148436-0017.flac," where's the folks, he asked? ma's sick a little, and didn't get up today. pause down to the corral, cousin mad, but i can cook you up some chow. all right, son. i got a dollar here that'll buy you a pretty good store knife."
4816,1867-148436-0042.flac," and as lips twisted back, the same smiley hat and hat and when he got into the saddle. but pretty soon, i suppose joe and soon i suppose joe had a chance to figure out that it didn't do him no particular harm to be alone. the minute he seen that he stopped fighting,"
4817,1867-148436-0014.flac, hello young fella and fella. low stranger. what's the chance of pumpkin here for three or four hours and getting a good feed for the haas? never better. give me the haas.
4818,1867-148436-0023.flac," he was a sure enough tenderfoot. tenderfoot. at least why he looked at it, and he talked it, but he wasn't. the familiarity of this, the familiarity of this, the familiarity of this description made steve set up a trifle straighter. was he a, the, the a ringer? maybe, i don't know."
4819,1867-148436-0018.flac, the boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw-colored hair seemed positively white. maybe you want to pay me? he suggested fiercely. maybe you think we're squatters at runa hotel.
4820,1867-148436-0004.flac, bard? who's he? logan considered the other with a sardonic smile.
4821,1867-148436-0037.flac," ah, twenty twenty twenty five dollars is enough, says pa. alright, says the tender foot. here's the money. any counts it out and pa's hand, hand, hand. he says, what a little little beauty. it would be a treat to see him work on a polo field. pa says."
4822,1867-148436-0031.flac, when he's seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself
4823,1867-148436-0044.flac," there wouldn't be no brawn card to get the boys around the house no more. but you're looking sort of sleepy stranger. i am, them answered nash. well, if you'd seen that show, you wouldn't be thinking of sleep, not for some time. maybe not."
4824,1867-148436-0006.flac," do you think i'm on somebody's trail? don't you know i've been through with that sort of game for a hell of a while. when rock's turned into hammond eggs, i'll trust you, steve. i'll tell you what i'd done to bart anyway. yesterday."
4825,1867-148436-0019.flac," recognizing the true western breed, even in this small addition, nash grand. speaking man to man son, i didn't think that, but i thought i'd sort of feel my way. which i'll say you're lucky you didn't try to feel your way with pa."
4826,1867-148436-0005.flac," you'll wear out the snapper on it. i'm on my way to the a-circle why. listen, i'm all for old manjru. you, you manjru. you know that. tell me what bard has on him. never heard the name before. did he wrestle a couple of your sheep?"
4827,1867-148436-0033.flac," and he always used to win out. in fact, he was known for it all around these parts. he begun nice and easy."
4828,1867-148436-0027.flac," and i won't ask much cash to boot. i began wondering what pa was driving at, but i didn't say nothing, just held myself together and waited. look over there to the corral,"" says pa, and pointed."
4829,1867-148436-0038.flac, then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the grin off my face. down goes the tender foot and takes his saddle and flops it on the pie-balled pinto. and the pie-balled was just as nice as milk. then he leads him out of the corral and gets on.
4830,1867-148436-0001.flac," and where the slopes pitch sharply down, it wound among the rocks with a faultless churnus of foot. certainly the choice, and certainly the choice of nash, and of nash was well made. an eastern horse of blood over a level course."
4831,1867-148436-0028.flac," it's the best horse i've ever had. it was the best horse pau ever had, too. it was a pie-balled pinto called jo, it's jo, after my cousin josiah, who's just a plain baddened, and it baddened, and raises hell when there's any excuse. the pie-balled"
4832,1867-148436-0022.flac," nash sipped his coffee and waited. on the mountain desert, one does not draw out a narrator with questions."
4833,1867-148436-0039.flac," but he didn't see none. then the circus started. and believe me, believe me, believe me, it was some circus. joe hadn't had much action for some time."
4834,1867-148436-0029.flac, he didn't even need an excuse. you see?
4835,1867-148436-0007.flac," then he hinted around about learning the way to eldera, because he knows that town is pretty close to drew's place, i guess. i told him, sure i did. he should have gone due west, but i sent him south. there is a south trail."
4836,1867-148436-0034.flac," and the end was the right or line on the ground. whenever the boys round here wanted any excitement, they used to come over and try their hands with joe."
4837,1867-148436-0015.flac," no, you won't put him up. i'll tend to that. looks like a badden. that's it."
4838,1867-148436-0003.flac, i suppose you're here asking after bard.
4839,1867-148436-0030.flac," when he leaves the corral, he likes to have another horse for a run and mate, and he was just as tame as anything. i could ride him. anybody could ride him. but if you take him outside the bars of the corral without company, first thing he'd done,"
4840,1867-148436-0002.flac," but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail. don came while they wound over the crest of the ridge, and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade. it was well into the morning before nash, before nash reached logan."
4841,1867-148436-0032.flac, which joe can raise more hell for his size than any horse that any horse that any horse i ever seen he's what you call an educated bucker. he don't fool around with no round with no pauses he just starts in and figures out a situation
4842,1867-148436-0036.flac," well, this tenderfoot, he looks over the horse and the crallon says,"
4843,1867-148436-0041.flac," which may be you sort of gather that he had to keep on performing, because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle. he was. and he never pulled leather. no sir, he never touched the buck and strap, but just sat there with his teeth set."
4844,1867-148436-0021.flac," i was just thinking of pa. what's he so about? come out short at poker lately? no, he lost a horse. ha ha ha. he explained."
4845,1867-148436-0043.flac," and started off at a gallop, the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go, was over there. damn my eye says pa."
4846,1867-148436-0016.flac," unsaddled him, and gave him a small feed. the horse first rolled on—strolled on—strolled on the dirt floor, and then started methodically on his father. having made sure that his mount was not off his feed, nash rolled a cigarette, and strolled back to the house with the boy."
4847,1867-148436-0040.flac, thinking up new ways of raising hell.
4848,1867-148436-0025.flac," the boy paused to remember, and then, with twinkling, twinkling eyes, he mimicked. that's very good of you, sir, but i'll only stop to make a trade with you. this horse and some cash, cash, cash to boot for a durable mount out of your corral."
4849,1867-148436-0012.flac," his eastern course, nash pursued for a mile or more."
4850,1867-148436-0011.flac," he sounds like a tender foot, but he ain't a tender foot. feeling that this parting shot gave him the honors of the meeting, he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs, overhearing, stood still and gazed at his master."
4851,1867-148436-0000.flac," chapter xii. the first day a-a. mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him, and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter. the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog."
4852,1867-148436-0024.flac, pa meets him at the door and asks him in.
4853,1867-148436-0035.flac, and team down the bruises after joe laid him cold on the ground.
4854,1743-142914-0003.flac," bush's young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point. the ground was soft in places, quite muddy. peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly."
4855,1743-142914-0022.flac," i think there is one right under my feet. he-he-he. right now. watch me get him. longbill boarded into the ground until his head was almost against it. when he pulled his bill out, sure enough, there was a worm. of course, explain longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this."
4856,1743-142914-0027.flac," every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs, that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw."
4857,1743-142914-0016.flac," for the first time, time, time, time, peter knows that there were many such little round holes all about. did you make all those little round holes explain, peter?"
4858,1743-142914-0000.flac," he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch, yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip. peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go."
4859,1743-142914-0010.flac," certainly, i'll excuse you, replied, excuse you, replied, excuse you, replied, peter, staring around very hard to see what it could be that long bill was making such a good meal of. but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat. they're, eat, they're, eat. there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground."
4860,1743-142914-0017.flac," and was there a worm in every one asked peter, his eyes very wide with interest? long bill nodded."
4861,1743-142914-0026.flac," there was a little pebbly beach. running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill. the bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black."
4862,1743-142914-0029.flac," before peter could say another word, teeter came running towards him, and, damn, and, damn, and it was plain to see, plain to see, plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something. don't move peter rabbit, don't move, he cried. why not demand it, but not demand it, but not demand it, peter, for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move."
4863,1743-142914-0004.flac," from right under his very nose, something, oh, something shot up into the air with a whistling sound. it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head."
4864,1743-142914-0008.flac," i recognized you just as i was like i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes, so i came right back. i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger."
4865,1743-142914-0006.flac," he scared me for a second. then you were even, said a voice, close at hand. you scared him. i saw you coming, but long bill didn't. peter turned quickly. there was mrs. woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussic of grass."
4866,1743-142914-0031.flac, mrs. teeter stood up and stepped aside. then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for aligning four white eggs with big dark blotches on them.
4867,1743-142914-0011.flac," longbill took two longer three steps in rather a stately fashion. peer had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance, yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow."
4868,1743-142914-0007.flac," i didn't mean to scare him, apologize, peter. i really didn't mean to. do you think he was really very much scared?"
4869,1743-142914-0009.flac," i'm glad it is no one but you, peter, for i was having a splendid meal here, and i should have hated to leave it. you'll excuse me while i go on eating, i hope. we can talk between bites."""
4870,1743-142914-0033.flac," it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it, he wouldn't have known she was there."
4871,1743-142914-0013.flac," his back was a mixture of grey, brown, black, and buff, while town black and buff, while town black and buff, while his breasts and underparts were a beautiful reddish buff. it was his head that made him look queer."
4872,1743-142914-0019.flac, while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for anyone to know that they were there.
4873,1743-142914-0001.flac," i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird. redwing was one of the first birds to arrive, and i've neglected him shamefully. when peter thinks of something to do, he waste no time."
4874,1743-142914-0028.flac," it was teeter, the spot at sandpiper, an old friend of peters. peter greeted him joyously."
4875,1743-142914-0023.flac," that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes it all. it's wonderful, sidepeter. i don't suppose anyone, that suppose anyone, suppose anyone else can find hidden worms that way, that way. my cousin, jack, snipecan, replied longville promptly."
4876,1743-142914-0014.flac," his eyes were very big, and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him. suddenly longville plunged his bill into the ground, he plunged it in for the whole length."
4877,1743-142914-0005.flac, he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes. then peter chuckled.
4878,1743-142914-0021.flac," long bill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him, him, him, and to peter's astonishment, he lifted the end of the upper half, the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all. that's the way i get them, said he."
4879,1743-142914-0030.flac," just then, then, then mrs. teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter. thank goodness, exclaimed teeter, still, still, still, still bobbing and bowing. if you had taken another step, peter rabbit, you would have stepped right on our eggs. you gave me a dreadful start."
4880,1743-142914-0012.flac," he was quite a little bigger than welcom robin. his tail was short, his legs were short, and his neck was short, but his bill was long enough to make up."
4881,1743-142914-0020.flac, and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take a man asked peter? long bill chuckled.
4882,1743-142914-0034.flac," my, he explained, i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me, said he. i'm so thankful i didn't. i don't see how you dared to lay them in the open like this."
4883,1743-142914-0025.flac," now, i must be running along. i'm ever so glad to have seen you, and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get. so peter said goodbye and kept on down the laughing brook to the, brook to the smiling pool. right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool,"
4884,1743-142914-0002.flac," off he start, otter, otter, started, liberty, liberty, lip for the smiling pool. he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows."
4885,1743-142914-0024.flac," he feeds the same way i do, only he likes marshes, she meadows, instead of brushy swamps. perhaps you—perhaps you—perhaps you know him."" peter nodded, i do, said he. now you speak of it, there is a strong family resemblance, although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before."
4886,1743-142914-0032.flac," they look so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world, but for mrs. teeter. peter hastily backed away a few steps. mrs. teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably."
4887,1743-142914-0018.flac," peter remembered how he had watched, welcomed robin, listened, and then suddenly plunged into the ground and pulled out a worm. but the worms welcomed robin got where always close to the surface."
4888,1743-142914-0015.flac, then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat. where that longbill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole.
4889,1743-142913-0018.flac," in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny-ren promptly. peter looked quite as surprised as he felt. does kresty make the hole, he asked? goodness gracious, no exclaimed jenny-ren."
4890,1743-142913-0019.flac," where are your eyes, peter? did you ever see a fly catcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood? she didn't wait for a reply, but rattled on. it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses. look!"
4891,1743-142913-0013.flac," it was such a funny thing for cresti to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace, and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mr. sun had kicked his bedclothes off."
4892,1743-142913-0017.flac," and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house, more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking, but snakeskins ug! by the way, where does christy build, asked peter?"
4893,1743-142913-0008.flac," that is something i don't often do. if you're please, peter, inquired politely, why do folks call you woodpewy? pewy chuckled happily."
4894,1743-142913-0030.flac," one is all i can take, all i can take care of. but then why demanded peter triumph only does mr. ren work all day, carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree? it seems to me that he is carried enough in there to build two or three nests."
4895,1743-142913-0015.flac," then, as peter shook his head, shook his head, shook his head, her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply. cresty and his wife always insist upon having a—pon having a piece of snake skin and the—snake skin and the—snake skin and their nest said she. why they wanted goodness knows, but—"
4896,1743-142913-0007.flac," but no one could ever mistake peewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over. aren't you here early, asked peter? peewee nodded."
4897,1743-142913-0010.flac," come as often as you like replied pewy, the oftener the better. back in the old briar patch peter thought overall he had learned about the fly catcher family, and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects, it suddenly struck him."
4898,1743-142913-0005.flac," but he wasn't sad, as peter—peter—peter—peter well knew. it was his way of expressing how happy he felt. he was a little bigger than his cousin chebuk, but looked very much like him. there was a little notch in the end of his tale."
4899,1743-142913-0024.flac," i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year. is there anybody else?"" again, jenny ran nodded. yenggang, the nut hatch, uses an old house, i'm told, but he usually goes up north for his nesting, said she."
4900,1743-142913-0023.flac," win some bluebird's stupid, snapped jenny- snap jenny-ran. peter grinned and looked foolish. of course said he. i forgot all about win some. and sk-sk-sk-skimmer the tree swallow at it jenny. that's so. i ought to have remembered him, exclaim, peter."
4901,1743-142913-0011.flac," that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take, that mother nature take care of her trees and other other growing things, which insects so dearly love to destroy."
4902,1743-142913-0006.flac," the upper half of his bill was black, but the lower half was light. peter could see on each wing two whitish bars, and he noticed that peewee's wings were longer than his tail, which wasn't the case with chebuk."
4903,1743-142913-0026.flac," then there are killy the sparrow. there are killy the sparrow. are killy the sparrow hawk. and spooky the screech owl. thou, thou, peter looked surprised. i didn't suppose they nested in holes and trees he exclaimed. they certainly do. more is the pity, snap jenny."
4904,1743-142913-0003.flac, it didn't take peter long to find a pee-wee. he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw a pee-wee fly out and make the same kind of little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies.
4905,1743-142913-0025.flac," tommy tipped the chickadee sometimes uses an old house, then in getting, getting, getting again he and mrs. chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves. yellow wing, the flicker, who really is a woodpecker, often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one."
4906,1743-142913-0009.flac," it is so quiet and restful, so quiet and restful that i love it. mrs. pewy and i are very retiring. we do not like too many near-nabbers. you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while, will you ask peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch?"
4907,1743-142913-0016.flac," perhaps they think it will scare robbers away. robbers away. robbers away. as for me, i should have a cold. i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest, if i had to sit on anything like that. i have to admit that crestian, his wife, or a handsome couple,"
4908,1743-142913-0022.flac," the older it is, the better it suits me. but the woodpecker seemed to like new houses best, which, as i said before, is a very good thing for the rest of us."
4909,1743-142913-0028.flac," spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable. he lives in it more or less the year around. now i must get back to those eggs of mine. i've talked quite enough for one morning. oh, jenny, crad peter, as a sudden thought struck him."
4910,1743-142913-0012.flac," but most of all, peter thought about that queer request of christie's, and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast-off coat of mr. blacksnake."
4911,1743-142913-0027.flac," it would be a good thing for the rest of us that they didn't ask at all, but they do, and an old house of yellow wing, the flicker, suits either of them. kelly always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year."
4912,1743-142913-0029.flac," jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently. well, what is it now, she demanded? have you got two homes, asked peter? good gracious, no exclaimed jenny!"
4913,1743-142913-0014.flac, jenny ran was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way in that way and that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast. she talked. jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to. did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded?
4914,1743-142913-0020.flac, there is downey the woodpecker. the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute. that's good. i like to see that. it means that next year there will be one more house for someone here in the old porch. they're old-cortured. for myself i prefer old houses.
4915,1743-142913-0021.flac," i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it. there is something settled about an old house. it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does. so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in,"
4916,1743-142913-0004.flac," it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady, rather lonely part of the green forest. almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintiff tone. pewy, pewy, pewy."
4917,1743-142913-0002.flac, he usually is one of the- he is one of the last of the fly catcher family to arrive. i didn't expect to find him yet. i wonder what has brought him up so early.
4918,1743-142913-0000.flac," with this, jenny ren disappeared inside her house, and there was nothing for peter to do, but once more, start for the dear old briar patch. on his way, he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest, which was just beyond the old orchard."
4919,1743-142913-0001.flac," he just had to find out if there was anything new over there. hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying, pewy, pewy, pewy, peter chuckled happily."
4920,1743-142912-0005.flac," and this way and that, that way, as if trying to get away from something or somebody. for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw."
4921,1743-142912-0001.flac," he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of chibbeck's. did you say you're fighting, cousin? he asked in a hesitating way. that is what i said, replied chibbeck. he is scrapper of the kingbird, as of course you know."
4922,1743-142912-0010.flac," scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors. he took them quite modestly, assuring them that he had done nothing."
4923,1743-142912-0019.flac," but if he couldn't see the fly, he could hear the sharp flick of scrapper's bill, and he knew, by the way, scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return, that he had caught the fly and it had tasted good."
4924,1743-142912-0024.flac," it was cresty the great crested fly catcher. he was a great crested fly catcher. he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the king bird, yet the king bird, yet not quite so big as welpham robin, and more slender."
4925,1743-142912-0015.flac, there wouldn't be any honey if i did.
4926,1743-142912-0007.flac," he was just a little smaller than welcom robben, and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant. but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that as it was."
4927,1743-142912-0023.flac," every way but the right way. look up over your head, cry the your head, cry the your head, cry the voice, rather a harsh voice."
4928,1743-142912-0004.flac," of course, peter couldn't be left out of anything like that, and he's scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him."
4929,1743-142912-0030.flac," he just couldn't understand about those cast-off suits, off suits, off suits of the snake family, and he felt sure that jenny ren could tell him. finally, curiosity got the best of him, and back he scampered, liberty-liberty-lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny ren had her home."
4930,1743-142912-0018.flac," there's a fly away over there beyond the old apple tree, watch me catch it. peter knew better than to weigh steady effort, trying to see that fly. he knew that he couldn't have seen it, had it been only one-fourth that distance away."
4931,1743-142912-0016.flac," those that i do catch are mostly drones, and you know, no, no, the drones are useless. they do no work at all. it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker. i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some don't."
4932,1743-142912-0032.flac, this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes barely snapped. didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed? didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping?
4933,1743-142912-0036.flac," he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you. because i know you know everything, especially everything concerning your neighbors."
4934,1743-142912-0033.flac," didn't i, peter rabbit? didn't i? didn't i? oh, you certainly did, jenny. you certainly didn't. you certainly didn't. certainly didn't. and i'm sorry to disturb you, replied peter, meekly. i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing, but i just didn't know who else to go to."
4935,1743-142912-0028.flac," a what, stamard peter? a cast-offsuit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied crusty somewhat impatiently. now don't forget, peter, i've got to go house hunting, but you'll find me there, or hear about, so if it happens that you find one of those..."
4936,1743-142912-0020.flac," are you going to build in the old orchard this year, aspieter? of course i am declared scrapper, right? just then he's spy blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him."
4937,1743-142912-0000.flac," and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard, and orchard, such a big proudly. slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot, and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear."
4938,1743-142912-0026.flac," you seemed to be in a hurry, so don't let me detain you, peter,"" said cresti, said cresti, before peter could find his time. i just—i just want to ask one little favor of you. what is it, ask peter, who—"
4939,1743-142912-0002.flac, the rest of us all here is safe when he is about. of course i know him declared peter is space clearing. where is he now?
4940,1743-142912-0017.flac," i am one of farmer-browns best friends if he did but know it. you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family, but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have, i'd like to know who it is."
4941,1743-142912-0034.flac," go to for what, snap jenny-ren? what is it you've come to me for? a snake skin's replied peter. snake skin's snake skin's streak jenny-ren."
4942,1743-142912-0027.flac," if you're roaming about, you run across an old, old, old cast-off suit of mr. black, of mr. black, of mr. black snake, or any other member of the snake family. i wish you would remember me and let me know, will you, peter, said crusty?"
4943,1743-142912-0011.flac," peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage. as peter looked up at scrapper, he saw that, like all the rest of the flycatchers, there was just the tiniest of books on the end of his bill."
4944,1743-142912-0031.flac," jenny called peter, jenny ran, jenny ran. no one answered him. he could hear mr.—he could hear mr. renn singing in another tree, but he couldn't see him. jenny, jenny ran, jenny ran, called peter again."
4945,1743-142912-0012.flac," scrappers slightly raised caps seemed all black, but if peter could have gotten close enough, he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red. while peter sat staring up at him, scrappers suddenly darted out into the air,"
4946,1743-142912-0006.flac," a white-throated white-breasted bird having a black cap and back, and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at red tail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat."
4947,1743-142912-0021.flac, turning away toward the green meadows instead. peter didn't wait for scrapper to return.
4948,1743-142912-0022.flac," just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard, someone called him. peter, oh peter rabbit called the voice. peter's feet are stopped, abruptly, sat up very straight. looked this way, looked that way, and looked the other way."
4949,1743-142912-0014.flac," the reminded peter that he had often heard the heard scrapper called the b-martin, and now he understood why. do you live on b's altogether asked peter?"
4950,1743-142912-0025.flac," his throat and breast were gray, shading into bright yellow underneath. his yellow underneath, his back and head were of a grayish brown, with a- brown, with a tint of all at green. a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking."
4951,1743-142912-0029.flac," cast off snake suits. before peter could say another word, cresty had flown away. peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch, and then towards jenny renn's house."
4952,1743-142912-0008.flac," he wasn't afraid, and he intended that everybody should know it, especially redtail. it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird. all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs, calling redtail a robber, and every other bad name he could think of."
4953,1743-142912-0003.flac," at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard, and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction, screaming at the top of their voices."
4954,1743-142912-0035.flac," you don't understand, cried peter, hurriedly. what i want to know is why should i should cresty the fly catcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast-off suits of the snake family?"
4955,1743-142912-0009.flac," all the other bird joined him in calling redtail bad names, but none, not even bully the english sparrow, was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail. when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him,"
4956,1743-142912-0013.flac," and his bill, and bill, bill snapped in quite the same way chebex did when he caught a fly. but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had, it was a bee. peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up."
4957,1502-122619-0090.flac, with the dignity of a monarch and the heir of a father.
4958,1502-122619-0001.flac," could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people. like their neighbors, they had followed walt calm into the territories of the english crown, and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks."
4959,1502-122619-0051.flac," he will see no change. it is, it is, it is true. my young men do not go out on the warpath. they had dreams for not doing so. but they love and venerate the great white chief."
4960,1502-122619-0092.flac," and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat his blessing. the young woman were content with touching his robe, or even drawing nihah's person."
4961,1502-122619-0006.flac," on that morning, when maghwa led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers and the forests, in the manner described, the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people."
4962,1502-122619-0084.flac, was whispered from mouth to mouth. magwai had often heard that was the the family of this wise and just delaware.
4963,1502-122619-0070.flac, standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious and perhaps injudicious and perhaps injudicious discussion.
4964,1502-122619-0035.flac, but the yankees have long arms and legs that never tire.
4965,1502-122619-0069.flac, his numbers some quite exceeded a thousand souls.
4966,1502-122619-0056.flac, a long amusing pause succeeded. the chief consulted apart with his companions. the message is dispatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe. as warrior after warrior dropped in.
4967,1502-122619-0021.flac," leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual to visit. and yet i'll be trained the least in patience by sign or word. during the short of frugal repasta followed,"
4968,1502-122619-0026.flac," the tomahawks of your young men, men, men have been very red. it is so, but they are now bright and dull, for the enkeys are dead, and the delawares are in neighbors."
4969,1502-122619-0023.flac," notwithstanding every individual president was perfectly aware,"
4970,1502-122619-0032.flac," good, exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time."
4971,1502-122619-0004.flac," that it once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection, and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters. as for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce to moncom through his emma series, with indian brevity."

5032,1502-122619-0011.flac," as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts. during the existence of this scene, a man suddenly appeared as a further-st extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village."
5033,1502-122619-0058.flac," the boys deserve their sports, and walk to deserve their sports, and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration. as they heard the brief exclamation of wonder, they so freely expressed the tromity of their hated foe."

5036,1502-122619-0068.flac," the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to sow solemn and unusual occurrence. but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain,"
5037,1502-122619-0042.flac," the red skins, the red skins, should be friends, and look with open eyes on the white man. has not my brother sent its spies in the woods? the delaware, whose name in english signified heart heart."

5042,1502-122619-0048.flac," the such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements. their distant villages, their hunting grounds,"
5043,1502-122619-0008.flac, a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits. but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends. the warriors were lounging in groups.

5054,1502-122615-0012.flac," he would greatly prefer its silence and meditation to speech, meditation to speech, meditation to speech. when it discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal. unfortunately, for this prudent resolution, his entertainers appear otherwise disposed."
5055,1502-122615-0022.flac," drew his tomahawk from his girdle, and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle."
5056,1502-122615-0026.flac, leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes.

5058,1502-122615-0016.flac," that would have given him more satisfaction. aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character, however, he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery. spirit's differ."

5060,1502-122615-0004.flac, the dying fires and the clearing cast a demon on certain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro. and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced to the lodge and exhibited the figure of ancas.

5062,1502-122615-0029.flac," like most around him for more than a minute, his look too was on the ground. but trusting his eyes at length to steal the glance aside, he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention."
5063,1502-122615-0033.flac, the expression of a zai contradicted his figurative and boastful language.

5067,1502-122615-0036.flac," suffered him to depart in silence. then, with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate, one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men,"
5068,1502-122615-0005.flac," after this termination of the scene, duncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned, and unnoticed, endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risky ran."
5069,1502-122615-0021.flac, several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again.
5070,1502-122615-0023.flac," ten minutes, which appeared so many ages to duncan, might have passed in this manner, and the warriors were fairly enveloped in this cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke."
5071,1502-122615-0007.flac," though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character, and the suspicious circumstances of his visit, he produced no visible sensation. so far, the tear will seem that it just occurred"
5072,1502-122615-0000.flac," a single moment served to convince the pope, ilyad. a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken. a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm, and the low voice of anka's muttered in his ear. the hurons are dogs."
5073,1502-122615-0015.flac," in the cases of such supposed visitations. he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends. it would therefore have been difficult, just then, to have uttered a proposal."

5075,1502-122615-0034.flac," standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph, he turned away as a sickening at the gaze of men. inveiling his face in his blanket, he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking."

5077,1502-122615-0019.flac," and drew his robe across his breast, as if about to lead the way and way to the lodge of the invalid. just then, a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door, and stalking silently among the attentive group,"
5078,1502-122615-0018.flac," equal to that maintained by the chief, who was in truth a new relative of the afflicted woman. the minutes lingered, and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventure in empiricism. when the hero and lady sighed his pipe,"
5079,1502-122615-0011.flac," in every other respect the captive seemed to liberty. still, he was excluded from all participation in the discourse, and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition."
5080,1502-122615-0025.flac, as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant. the smoke reased above their heads and little eddies.
5081,1502-122615-0010.flac," david had not reappeared. no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron. he would place himself at hand, though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway."

5090,1502-122615-0003.flac," but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door, and it managed him with the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse. slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mangled with the throng that hovered nigh."
5091,1502-122615-0006.flac," he retraced his steps to the council lodge, resolved to seek in question david, in order to put it into his doubts. unreaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution,"
5092,1502-122615-0020.flac," he seated himself on one end of the lope, a pile of brush, which sustained duncan. the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magwa."

5095,1334-135589-0095.flac," tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct. you are right, i will. i fear however, humphrey, that you are right and eateth wrong as regards his daughter."
5096,1334-135589-0105.flac," oswald, so soon as edward came down to arnewood, gave up his place in the new forest, and lived entirely with edward as his steward. and phoebe also went to arnewood, and lived to a good old age."
5097,1334-135589-0092.flac," i was about to call upon him, but i wanted to see you first. i will go with you, if you. i have not done him justice,"" replied edward. and yet i hardly know how to explain to him. say nothing, but meet him cordially."
5098,1334-135589-0096.flac," nay, edward, recollect that i have, as edith observed, passed my life in the woods. edward was most kindly received by mr. heatherstone. edward,"
5099,1334-135589-0101.flac, some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history. humphrey must take the first place. his love of farming continued. edward gave him a large farm rent-free.
5100,1334-135589-0102.flac," and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for her himself. he then married clara redcliffe, who was not appeared lately on the scene, owing to her having been about two years before the restoration,"
5101,1334-135589-0106.flac," in the capacity of housekeeper. her temper are becoming rather worse than better, as she is, than better, as she advanced in years. this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties."
5102,1334-135589-0100.flac," to alice, and grenville to edith. and as his majesty himself said, as he gave away the brides, could loyalty be better rewarded? but our young readers will not be content. if they do not hear,"
5103,1334-135589-0094.flac, what must he think of my not having called upon him? nothing you hold you hold you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him you're coming with me will make it appear so
5104,1334-135589-0099.flac," then, all was explained. upon a year after the restoration, there was a fet at hampton court, given an honor of three marriages taking place. edward beverly, two patients' heatherstone, shalenaire,"
5105,1334-135589-0091.flac," after that speech, sir, the sooner you get back again, the better. retorted, edith. but edward made it. but edward made it. but edward made a sign to humphrey, and they beat a retreat. have you seen the intent in humphrey? no."
5106,1334-135589-0098.flac, and patients colored up and trembled when edward first saw her. edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance. he wooed her again and won her.
5107,1334-135589-0104.flac," the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo, who became a very steady character. and in the course of time, married a young girl from arnewood and had a house full of young gypsies."
5108,1334-135589-0097.flac, on mr. heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to our relative to our relative to our inward expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
5109,1334-135589-0027.flac," were among the most favorite of those in his train. as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude, the windows of all the houses were filled with well-dressed ladies who waved their white kirchifts to the king."
5110,1334-135589-0073.flac," there was the same, same, same, same, pensive, sweet expression in her face, which had altered little. but the beautiful rounded arms"
5111,1334-135589-0028.flac," and his attendant, suit. shalenaire, edward, and granville, who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting, were certainly the most distinguished among the king's wets knew. look edward."
5112,1334-135589-0040.flac," now, edward, who do you think was here today? the reigning bell and the toast of all the gentlemen? indeed, i must be careful of my heart. dear edith, who is she?"
5113,1334-135589-0054.flac," recollect also that mr. heatherstone, and his brother-in-law, sir ashley cooper, have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do. they have been most important agents in his restoration."
5114,1334-135589-0006.flac," you are here highly spoken of,"" said the prince, for so young a man. so you were at the affair of worcester? we will retain you, for your services will be wanted by and by."
5115,1334-135589-0078.flac," when he entered the room, he found the room, he found himself in the arms of humphrey, who had arrived with the messenger. after the greetings were over, edward said, �alice and i have seen patience, and i fear i must surrender at discretion�"
5116,1334-135589-0048.flac," but i do not acknowledge his right of possession. nay, much as i admire and i may say, fond as i am, for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter. it still appears to me that"
5117,1334-135589-0063.flac," but at the same time, if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once, before the king's intentions are known, they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value. now is their time."
5118,1334-135589-0016.flac," and the contents removed a heavy load from edward's mind. but he now thought of nothing but war, and although he cherished the idea of patience he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could."
5119,1334-135589-0044.flac," and i understand is a very princely mention. humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong. it belongs to mr. heatherstone, does it not? replyed edward?"
5120,1334-135589-0020.flac," and expelled king charles from the french funchiers. the war was still carried on in the netherlands. teren bordont-kanda, who had gained every campaign, and the court of spain, weird with reverses."
5121,1334-135589-0036.flac," allesson edith rose, rose, and waved their hanker-chiffs, but they were soon obliged to cease, and put them to their eyes. are those your sisters, edward, said the king? they are your majesty."""
5122,1334-135589-0079.flac," mr. heatherstone may make his own term. make his own terms. i must wave all pride, rather than lose her. i thought that i had more control over myself, but i have seen her. and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife."
5123,1334-135589-0015.flac," and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards, he fell back to the frontiers of champagne. previous to his departure from paris, edward had received humphries letter explaining away the attendance conduct."
5124,1334-135589-0005.flac," kanda is just now released from vincennes, but dependipont, he will be in arms very soon. as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king, edward presented himself at the levy of the prince of kanda."
5125,1334-135589-0019.flac," and edward, with his friends, fowls his fortunes and gained his goodwill. they were rapidly promoted. time flew on, and in the year 1654, the court of france concluded an alliance with cromwell."
5126,1334-135589-0010.flac," so the prince, in secures, in secures, in securing the services of such fine young men. you will blight me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service. and then follow me to gien, to which province i am now about to depart."
5127,1334-135589-0076.flac, i trust that the daughter will often grace our court. patients made no reply but passed on. and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd.
5128,1334-135589-0075.flac," and then his daughter was led forward, and introduced by a lady unknown to edward. after he had sluited her, her, her, the king said, loud enough for edward to hear."
5129,1334-135589-0035.flac," although i always thought that they were handsome. as they passed, edward caught the eye of edith and smiled. «alice, that's edward!» said edith, so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him."
5130,1334-135589-0064.flac," even a few days delay may make a difference. they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the money. impressed that upon them, my dear edward."
5131,1334-135589-0061.flac," and now, let me give you some advice for your friends, master schallonair and grenville. that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands, i know. and probably, they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king."
5132,1334-135589-0072.flac," but little altered, except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect, but imperfect and perfect in her figure. and her court-dressed displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed, or which time had not matured."
5133,1334-135589-0090.flac," reply, de-dith, re-dith, to be sure, you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all of your life. very true, my dear sister, perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me."
5134,1334-135589-0023.flac," after the peace and the pardon of khanda by the french king, the armies were disbanded, and the three adventurers were free. they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services."
5135,1334-135589-0012.flac," and had been reinforced by troops from spain, set up the standard of revolt. edward and his friends joined them with about 300 english and scotchmen, which they had enlisted, and very soon afterwards,"
5136,1334-135589-0062.flac," those who hold the property think so too, and so far it is fortunate. now, from wiserheads and mine."
5137,1334-135589-0021.flac," made overtures of peace, which was gladly accepted by the french. during these wars, cromwell had been named protector, and had shortly afterward died."
5138,1334-135589-0058.flac," you were at the wars. it was possible that you might or might not return. he said this to humphrey, as to humphrey, who has all long been acting as his factotum in the business. and recollect at the time that mr. heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion."
5139,1334-135589-0030.flac," they are thy sisters, alice and edith."
5140,1334-135589-0024.flac," and they then hastened to king charles, who had left spain and come to the low countries. at the time of their joining the king, richard, the son of cromwell, who had been nominated protector, had resigned, and everything was ready for the restoration."
5141,1334-135589-0007.flac, can you procure any of your countrymen? i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge. but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for. anymore?
5142,1334-135589-0080.flac," let her father but give me her, and arnwood, arnwood, arnwood will be but a trifle in addition. with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood, set humphrey, i can inform you what they are."
5143,1334-135589-0038.flac," and they could escape from their personal attentions, edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conning him and his sisters. we passed over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure"
5144,1334-135589-0000.flac," chapter 27 but we must follow edward for a time. on his arrival at paris, he was kindly received by king charles, who promised to assist his views in joining the army."
5145,1334-135589-0085.flac," it is now seven years since you quit at the forest, and in your letters to mr. heatherstone, you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patients. since that, you have never corresponded or sent any messages."
5146,1334-135589-0087.flac," and it may be true. reply that word morenfully. well,"
5147,1334-135589-0082.flac," has fully acted up to what he stated were his views. when he first obtained a grant of the property, he has indeed replied edward. as for his daughter, edward, you have yet to win her and wear her."
5148,1334-135589-0074.flac," and the proportion of the whole figure, a whole figure, a whole figure was a surprise to him. and edward, in his own mind, i-i-i-n, agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the and toast of the toast of the day. mr. heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance."
5149,1334-135589-0029.flac," at those lovely girls at yon window. did you recognize them? indeed, i do not. are they any of our paris beauties?"
5150,1334-135589-0052.flac," he cannot refuse it. put not your trust in prince's brother, replied alice, i doubt if the king, king, king or his counsel will consider it advisable to make so many discontented."
5151,1334-135589-0066.flac," that the advice was immediately acted upon, and that chalenaire and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years' purchase. edward remained at court several days. he had written to humphrey and had dispatched the messenger with the letter."
5152,1334-135589-0059.flac," what prospect was there of the restoration of the king? or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property? i believe, however, that humphrey knows more of mr. heather stone's intentions than he has made known to us."
5153,1334-135589-0067.flac, but the messenger had not yet returned.
5154,1334-135589-0050.flac," you will not accept them. they must be divided. you will hand it over to you and too,"" said alice, smiling. you mistake, dearest. i am not so foolish, but i have a certain pride which you cannot blame. accepting the property from mr. heatherstone,"
5155,1334-135589-0014.flac," and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of st. antoine, in which neither party had the advantage."
5156,1334-135589-0081.flac," they are wholly unshackled. further than that, you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house. this i am empowered to state to you, and i think you will allow that mr. heatherstone"
5157,1334-135589-0089.flac," to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her. it may be so edith, replied humphrey. women are riddles. i only argue upon the common sense of the thing. much you know about women."
5158,1334-135589-0026.flac," was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london, which she entered amid the acclimations of the people on the 29th of the same month. we may leave the reader to suppose that edward"
5159,1334-135589-0068.flac," on the following day a drawing room was to be held, and edward's sisters were to be presented. edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king, amusing himself for the presentations as they took place."
5160,1334-135589-0056.flac," at all events, edward, recollect, you do not know what are the intentions of mr. heatherstone. wait and see what he propheses first, first, first. but my dear sister, it appears to me— sister, it appears to me— sister, it appears to me that his intentions are evident."
5161,1334-135589-0055.flac," and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you. besides, merely for what may be called a point of honor, for it is no more, in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty?"
5162,1334-135589-0041.flac," no less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted, edward. patience heatherstone. patience heatherstone cried, edward, the toast of all london. yes, and deservedly so."
5163,1334-135589-0011.flac," and after my absence, you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required. a month after this interview, kanda, who had been joined by a great number of nobles,"
5164,1334-135589-0053.flac, which has been so long held by others.
5165,1334-135589-0045.flac," how can you say so edward? you received tompriz letters a long while ago. yes, i did. but, but, but, but, but, let us not talk about it anymore, my dear edith. i am in great perplexity."
5166,1334-135589-0043.flac," with her today. when did you hear her from humphrey edith? a few days back, he has left the cottage now altogether with other. indeed, where does he reside then? at arnewood, the house has been rebuilt."
5167,1334-135589-0032.flac, will they think you recognize us? we shall see. reply dead word.
5168,1334-135589-0004.flac," i will give you letters to kanda, and recollect that whatever general you take service under, you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong. that is not your affair."
5169,1334-135589-0022.flac," edward, who but rarely heard from humphrey, was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain. but to leave his colors, while things were adverse, was impossible."
5170,1334-135589-0060.flac," and i therefore say again, my dear edward, make no application to you ascertain what mr. heatherstone's intentions may be. your advice is good, my dear alice, and i will be guided by it. be guided by it. replyed, edward."
5171,1334-135589-0046.flac," what is your perplexity? well, replied edward. since it is to be so, let us sit down and talk over the matter. i acknowledge the kindness of mr. heatherstone."
5172,1334-135589-0070.flac," mr. heatherstone, who led his daughter, patience. that they had not perceived him was evident. indeed, her eyes were not raised once, from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty."
5173,1334-135589-0042.flac," i can assure you, but she is as good as she is handsome, and moreover treats all the gay galants with perfect indifference. she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper, and her father is also in town"
5174,1334-135589-0018.flac," except in inquiring after her, after her, after her health, and sending his respects. it may be years before i see her again, thought edward, and who knows what may happen."
5175,1334-135589-0049.flac," although not said, it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer. and i will accept no wife on such conditions. that is to say, because all you wish for, your property and the woman you love are offered you in one lot."
5176,1334-135589-0069.flac," and waiting for the arrival of his sisters. shalinear of his sisters. shalinear of his sisters. shalinear and granville were not with him. they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to. when his eyes caught, advancing toward the king,"
5177,1334-135589-0017.flac," he wrote a letter to the attendant, thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him, and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again. he did not, however, think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter."
5178,1334-135589-0013.flac," kind of obtained the victory of blenon and in april 1652, advanced to paris. to ren, who had taken the command of the french army followed him."
5179,1334-135589-0025.flac," on 15 may 1660, the news arrived, was arrived, was arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the 8th, and a large body of gentleman went to invite him over. the king sailed from shevelling."
5180,1334-135589-0086.flac," and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of 17 to 24 will cherish the image of one who, to say the least, had treated her within difference. that is my view of the matter edward. it may be wrong."
5181,1334-135589-0084.flac," but why should you say so, humphrey? have we not been attached from our youth? yes, it was a youthful passion, i grant. but recollect, nothing came of it. and years have passed away."
5182,1334-135589-0034.flac," well, shall an heir, to all appearance, your good aunts have done justice to their charge. nature has done more, edward. i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have."
5183,1334-135589-0057.flac, why is he rebuilt on wood? he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house.
5184,1334-135589-0033.flac," for while they had been speaking, the procession had stopped. is it possible, thought at word, that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage? and yet it must be."
5185,1334-135589-0031.flac," it is so, i believe, replied edward. yes, now that he did smiles, i'm sure it is them. yes, replied, grandville."
5186,1334-135589-0088.flac, you know humphrey. humphrey. how many offers patients heather stone has had and has every day i may say.
5187,1334-135589-0065.flac," and make the arrangements. that is advice which must be followed, reply that word. we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night. we may as well here inform the reader"
5188,1334-135589-0083.flac, as the saying is. her father will resign the property to you as you are by right. but you have no property in his daughter. and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you.
5189,1334-135589-0039.flac," which it gave to edward to find his sister's grown, such a cuck, which accomplished an elegant young woman. that is two friends who were, as the reader will recollect, old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received. we hardly need say."
5190,1334-135589-0002.flac, and to ren. i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon. that will be and be the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players. which would your mages do you recommend me to follow? inquired edward.
5191,1334-135589-0037.flac," the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obi sense to the window where they were standing. we shall have some court beauties, beverly,"" said the king, looking at him over his shoulder. as soon as the ceremonies were over,"
5192,1334-135589-0047.flac," and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true. still, still, still, i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine, and that he has no right to give. i acknowledge his generosity."
5193,1088-134318-0009.flac," bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk, or better still, place them on a plate in the hall. very good, sir, said the man, and withdrew. down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tessellated hallway."
5194,1088-134318-0007.flac," carra breathed a sigh of relief, and his face was breathed in smiles. well, miles. well, of course, tell him to come up, come up, come up, come up. ask him if he minds seeing me in my room. i told him you were in bed, sir, and he used shocking language, said fisher. carra laughed. send him up, he said."
5195,1088-134318-0001.flac," it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasants cabin on the hillside, outside dorazo, to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at carras wim, all that life held for a man."
5196,1088-134318-0015.flac," fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below. ten minutes later, he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him. fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion."
5197,1088-134318-0017.flac," and fisher, standing at the foot of the stairs, wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial. i suppose your check will be honored all right, asked the visitors ardonically, and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door."
5198,1088-134318-0002.flac," to the hateful eyes of the girl's father, who stood with folded arms, glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor. to the smoke-stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof."
5199,1088-134318-0016.flac," no more on patagonia, he roared. no more tear del fuego. he paused. certainly, he replied to someone in question, but not patagonia. he paused again."
5200,1088-134318-0014.flac," he pushed open the door and announced mr. gather cole, and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent, who, with top hat still on the top of his head, and his overcoat dangling about his heels, must have made a remarkable picture."
5201,1088-134318-0010.flac," muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a mistr, mistr, mistr, certain amused antagonism. mr. kara will see you, sir,"" said fisher. ah-ha, said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher, at the unoffending fisher, at the unoffending fisher. that's very good of him."
5202,1088-134318-0004.flac," he remembered the day well because it was candle this day, and this was the anniversary. he remembered other things more pleasant."
5203,1088-134318-0006.flac," had tx returned, he slipped from the bed and went to the door, opened it slightly, and listened. tx, with a search warrant, might be a source of panic, especially if he shrugged his shoulders, he had satisfied tx and delayed his suspicions."
5204,1088-134318-0018.flac," damn all greeks, he said greeks, he said greeks, he said jovili, and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully, the smile being, being his very own, the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him. the traveler touched the other on the chest with his right hand. never, trust a greek, he said."
5205,1088-134318-0003.flac," to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat, bound to a post, with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy, infernal machine under his chair."
5206,1088-134318-0000.flac, chapter xii
5207,1088-134318-0012.flac," yes, sir, said the valet hastily. is it real gray? insisted the visitor? pull one out and see, see, see. the startled fisher drew back, back with an apologetic smile. i couldn't think of doing a thing like that, sir. oh, you couldn't sneer the visitor."
5208,1088-134318-0013.flac," then lead on. fisher showed the way up the stairs. this- stairs. this- stairs. this time the traveler carried no books. his left arm hung limply by his side, and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the- not loose from the detaining pocket, without its owner being aware of the fact."
5209,1088-134318-0005.flac, he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would-be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pizarra.
5210,1088-134318-0021.flac," until eleven o'clock at any rate. he is a funk snapped the other, a beastly funk. he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread, opened the front door without assistance, slammed it behind him, and disappeared into the night."
5211,1088-134318-0019.flac," always get your money in advance. all advance. is that clear to you? yes, sir, said fisher. but, sir. but i think you will always find that mr. care is always most generous about money. don't you believe it? don't you believe it, my poor man, said the other. you."
5212,1088-134318-0011.flac," yes, sir, said fisher. look here. the man thrust out his face. do you see those gray hairs in my beard? the embarrassed fisher, grinned. is it gray? challenge the visitor with a roar?"
5213,1088-134318-0008.flac," yes, sir, said the servant. such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him. there was much that he had to do, and that knight's freedom would assist him materially. perhaps, kara hesitated. perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock."
5214,1088-134318-0020.flac," at that, that, that, that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang. what's that? ask the vis-vis-vis-visitor a little startled. mr. kara's put down his steel latch, said fisher with a smile, which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch."
5215,1088-134315-0021.flac," he will probably be interested if you take him into the library."" ""'very good, sir,' said the urbane fisher. ""'will you change before you go out?' cara shook his head. ""'i think head. i think head. i think i will go as i am,' he said. ""'get me my fur coat. this beastly cold kills me.'"
5216,1088-134315-0018.flac," to refuse the favors of remington cara was, by him, regarded as something of an affront."
5217,1088-134315-0057.flac," an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected. she returned the papers to the drawer, pushed it to, and locked it. she gave her attention to the second drawer. her hand shook a little as she pulled it open."
5218,1088-134315-0046.flac," she handed him the letter, and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription."
5219,1088-134315-0039.flac, he told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest. six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently. what dog am i that i should wait till six?
5220,1088-134315-0015.flac," tx, he went on somewhat, somewhat irregularly, is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect. you will probably meet him again, for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself. i need hardly tell you."
5221,1088-134315-0052.flac," i know he goes in sometimes because i tried to dodge that my brother, who's a policeman, taught me. i stretched a bit of white cotton across, and it was broke the next morning. mr. kara keeps some of his private papers in there, so the girl quietly. he has told me so himself."
5222,1088-134315-0032.flac," he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown, and began to descend the stairs to the hall. he was less than halfway down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him. there is a gentleman who wants to see mr. kara, she said. here is his card."
5223,1088-134315-0009.flac," is that your creed?"" she asked quietly. part of it, miss holland, he smiled. she played idly with the letter she held in her hand, bouncing it on the edge of the desk, her eyes downcast."
5224,1088-134315-0013.flac," that is a word i never use, nor do i like to hear it employed,"" he said. blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money."
5225,1088-134315-0050.flac," the maid who was also cook arose up as the- the girl entered. it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen, miss,"" she smiled. i'm afraid you're rather lonely, mrs. beale said the girls sympathetically. lonely miss cried the maid."
5226,1088-134315-0034.flac," he was a man who would have attracted attention, if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance. he was dressed in a well-worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check. he had a top hat, glossy and obviously new at the back of his head."
5227,1088-134315-0049.flac," but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her. she heard the soft thud of the front door closing, and rising, she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street. she watched fisher until he was out of sight."
5228,1088-134315-0003.flac," i shall feel that his trip, which has cost me a large sum of money, will not have been waken, waken, wasted. i am, dear mr. meredith, yours very sincerely, remington cara."
5229,1088-134315-0045.flac," at six o'clock, miss, the man replied. there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered. shall i ring up for a messenger? no, i don't think that would be advisable. you would better take it yourself."
5230,1088-134315-0051.flac," i fairly get the creeps. i, i, i, sitting here hour after hour. it's that door that gives me the hump, hump. she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood. that's mr. carras' wine-seller. nobody's been in it but him."
5231,1088-134315-0028.flac," answering letters appealing for charitable donations, and in the haque words which fall to the secretaries of the great. havier plenished the fire, asked deferentially for any instructions, and returned again to his quest."
5232,1088-134315-0007.flac," whippaman and the memory of it passes. frighten him, fill him with a sense of foreboding and apprehension, and let him believe that something dreadful is going to happen, either to himself or to someone he loves. better the latter."
5233,1088-134315-0020.flac, to taint him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him.
5234,1088-134315-0023.flac, close the door carefully and return to the house.
5235,1088-134315-0029.flac," this time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations. the safe, he did not attempt to touch, but there was a small bureau in which kara would have placed his private correspondence of the morning. this however yielded no result."
5236,1088-134315-0011.flac," if i can buy it, well and good. if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me, so much the better. if i can obtain it by any merit i possess, i utilize that merit."
5237,1088-134315-0016.flac," he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile. i deprecating smile. i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person, said the girl coldly. i am paying you three pounds a week, i think, he said."
5238,1088-134315-0027.flac," this interested him mightily, mightily, and he replaced the checkbook with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly. he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of karr's correspondence."
5239,1088-134315-0041.flac," deftly, he lifted his left hand from the pocket, croaked the elbow, elbow by some quick manipulation, and throast the books, which the valet most reluctantly handed to him, back to the place from when he had taken them. tell mr. kara i will call it my own time."
5240,1088-134315-0035.flac," a pair of, a pair of, a pair of pinn snaz sat crookedly on his nose, and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture. arm completed the picture, arm completed the picture. fisher, who was an observer of some dis-dessertment, noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit, large black boots,"
5241,1088-134315-0033.flac," fisher took the card from the salver and read, mr. george gathercole, jr. traveler's club. i'll see this gentleman, he said, with a sudden brisk interest. he found the visitor standing in the hall."
5242,1088-134315-0031.flac," there was a little knob for the—the knob for the—the knob for the purpose, and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made—the fit which had been made to receive it on the door itself. rum, cove, he said again, and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up, left the room, closing the door softly behind him."
5243,1088-134315-0012.flac," providing always that i can secure my object, i can secure my object, i can secure my object in the time. otherwise, he shrugged his shoulders. i see, she said nodding her head quickly. i suppose that is how blackmailers feel. he frowned."
5244,1088-134315-0006.flac," if he expected her to give him any encouragement for seed, he was disappointed. probably he required no such encouragement. for in the presence of his social inferior, he was somewhat monopolizing. cudamann's flesh and its heels, he said."
5245,1088-134315-0001.flac," the apologies which are due to you. i feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your more steam nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self-respect. i am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man, george gathercole."
5246,1088-134315-0014.flac," and according to your argument, they are also justified. it is a matter of plain, he said early. viewed from my standpoint, they are sort-ed criminals. the sort of person that tx meets, i presume, in the course of his daily work."
5247,1088-134315-0043.flac," fisher went back to the library. the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up. i am afraid, miss holland. i've got myself into very serious trouble. what is that? is that fisher? ask the girl."
5248,1088-134315-0058.flac," it was a square case covered in red morocco leather. o leather. she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry. at last she set a loud, and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face."
5249,1088-134315-0010.flac," what would justify the use of such an awful weapon, she asked? it is, it is, it is, it is, amply justified to secure an end, he said, blandly. for example, i want something. i cannot obtain any that something through the ordinary channel, or by the employment of ordinary means."
5250,1088-134315-0036.flac," and a pair of pearl studs. the newcomer glared round at the valet. take these, he ordered preempturally and preempturally pointing to the books under his arm. fisher hastened to obe, and hastened to obe, and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to a system."
5251,1088-134315-0019.flac," he rang the bell, this time for his valet. fisher, he said, i am expecting a visit from a gentleman named gavercol, a one-armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes."
5252,1088-134315-0055.flac, in that case was a new steel key.
5253,1088-134315-0030.flac," rum cove said fisher. he paused from moment before the closed door of the room, and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework. he lifted it gingerly."
5254,1088-134315-0053.flac," said the woman doubtfully. i wish he'd brick it up. the same as he has the lower cellar. i get the horrors, sittin'—so i've sittin' here at night, expecting the door to open and the ghost of the mad lord to come out. him that was killed in africa. miss holland laughed. i want you to go out now, she said."
5255,1088-134315-0017.flac," i intend increasing that to five pounds, because you suit me most admirably. thank you, sir, the girl quietly, but i am already being paid quite sufficient. she left him, a little astonished, and not a little ruffled."
5256,1088-134315-0005.flac," a man against whom my favorite weapon would fail. she looked at him with interest in her eyes. what is your favorite weapon, mr. kara?"" she asked. fear, he said."
5257,1088-134315-0037.flac," either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand. accidentally, the valet's hand pressed against the other sleeve, and he received a shock. for the forearm was clearly an artificial one. it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck."
5258,1088-134315-0056.flac," in two, two seconds it was open, and she was examining its contents. it was a large safe of the usual type. there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box."
5259,1088-134315-0002.flac," to disturb a relationship which i have always hoped, jace hoped, would be mutually pleasant. if you will allow gather cole, who will be unconscious of the party is playing, to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself,"
5260,1088-134315-0042.flac," good morning to you. if you would only wait, sir, pleaded the agonized, the agonized, goody agonized fisher. wait be hanged, snor-fisher. wait be hanged, snor-all the other. i've waited three years, i tell you. tell mr. carrot to expect me, good to expect me, good to expect me, when he sees me. he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him."
5261,1088-134315-0038.flac," and this view of the stranger's infirmity was and was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand, took hold of the gloved left hand, and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat. where is kara, throughout the stranger?"
5262,1088-134315-0054.flac," the girl ascended to the upper floor. again, she watched from the window the disappearing figure. once out of sight, miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness. from her bag, she produced a small purse and opened it."
5263,1088-134315-0026.flac," mr. fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon kara's checkbook, which told him that on the previous day the greek had drawn 6,000 pounds in cash from the bank."
5264,1088-134315-0025.flac," kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point. in his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as fred, and on more occasions than one, and for no apparent reason, had tipped his servant over and above his salary."
5265,1088-134315-0008.flac," and you will hurt him beyond forgetfulness. fear is a tyrant and a despot, more terrible than the rack, more potent than the stake. fear is many-eyed and sees horrors where normal vision only sees the ridiculous."
5266,1088-134315-0022.flac," he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street. keep, keep, keep my fire going, put all my private letters in my bedroom, and see that miss holland has her lunch. fisher followed him to his car, wrapped the fur rug about his legs."
5267,1088-134315-0000.flac," as you know, and as i have given you proof, i have the greatest admiration in the world for one whose work for humanity has one such universal recognition. i hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person."
5268,1088-134315-0048.flac," the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle-aged domestic who was parlor-made, serving-made, and housekeeper in one. miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon."
5269,1088-134315-0024.flac," that he should return to carous study and set that the papers in order was natural and proper. that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers and carous desk might be excused on the score of diligence, since he was, to some extent, in the confidence of his employer."
5270,1088-134315-0047.flac," special service department, scotland d.r. whitehall. he put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change. largest the house was, cara did not employ a regular staff of servants. a maid in a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff."
5271,1088-134315-0040.flac," 6 o'clock, eh? you will tell mr. cara that i called. give me those books. but i assure you, sir, stammered fisher. give me, sir, stammered fisher. give me, sir, stammered fisher. give me those books, word the other."
5272,1088-134315-0044.flac," mr. gather call said the girl quickly. fisher, mr. notted. yes, miss. i couldn't get—i couldn't get him to stay, though. she perched her lips thoughtfully. mr. kara will be very cross, but i—mr.—miss very cross, but i don't see how you can help it. i wish you would called me."
5273,1088-134315-0004.flac," kara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope. he rang a bell on his table, and the girl who had so filled tx with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room. you will see that this is delivered, miss holland."
5274,1088-129236-0027.flac," he walks with arms a kimbo. he is salilacuises. he accosts the grass and the trees. he feels the blood of the violet, the clover, and the lily in his veins, and he talks with the brook that what's his foot."
5275,1088-129236-0020.flac," the morning and the night varied, and the night varied in chantments. when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound, and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory."
5276,1088-129236-0017.flac, yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows. but here is a strange fact. it may seem to many men in revising their experience.
5277,1088-129236-0024.flac," all other pleasures are not worth its pains. and when the day was not long enough, but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections, when the head boiled all night on the pillow with a generous steed it resolved on."
5278,1088-129236-0029.flac, the like force has the passion over all his nature. it expands the sentiment. it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart.
5279,1088-129236-0030.flac," into the most pitiful and abject, it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world, so only it have the countenance of the beloved object. in giving him to another, it still more gives him to himself."
5280,1088-129236-0022.flac," the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water, but as plutarch said, in nammalt, but as plutarch said, in nammalt, but as plutarch said, in nammalt in fire, and make the study of midnight. thou art not gone being gone, whereer thou art."
5281,1088-129236-0018.flac, that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages where an affection contrived to give a witch craft. so passing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances.
5282,1088-129236-0023.flac," by loving heart. by the in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throw about the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough, by love be enough, but must be drugged by the relish of pain and fear, for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love."
5283,1088-129236-0019.flac," no man ever forgot the v-o-man ever forgot the v-o-man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things and things and things anew. which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art, which made the face of nature radiant with purple light."
5284,1088-129236-0028.flac," the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse. it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under any other circumstances."
5285,1088-129236-0015.flac," he holds her books to help her, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct. among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him, and"
5286,1088-129236-0016.flac," for persons are love's world, and the coalist philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love, without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature ought derogatory to the social instincts."
5287,1088-129236-0014.flac," it is the dawn of civility and grace in the course and rustic. the rude village boy teases the girls about the schoolhouse door, but today he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel."
5288,1088-129236-0025.flac," the clouds have faces as he looks on them, the trees of the forest, the waving grass, and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent, and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite. yet nature soothes and sympathizes."
5289,1088-129236-0021.flac," when no place is too solitary and none too silent, for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts, than any old friends, though best and purest, can give him. for the figures, the motions."
5290,1088-129236-0026.flac," a midnight bell, a passing groan. these passing groan. these are the sounds we feed upon."" behold there in the wood the fine madman. he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights. he dilates. he is twice a man."
5291,1088-129236-0002.flac," unites him to and to his race. pludges him to the domestic and civic relations. carries him with new sympathy into nature, new sympathy into nature, new sympathy into nature. enhances the power of the senses. opens the imagination. adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes."
5292,1088-129236-0004.flac," one must not be too old. the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom."
5293,1088-129236-0009.flac," and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history. for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured."
5294,1088-129236-0011.flac," dual care and canker and fear. with thought, with the thought, with the ideal, is a mortal hilarity, the rose of joy, round it all the muses sing. but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of today and yesterday."
5295,1088-129236-0008.flac," only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aide we may attain that inward view of the law, which i'll describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle be holding."
5296,1088-129236-0012.flac, the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this proportion which this proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society. what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment?
5297,1088-129236-0000.flac," every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments. each of its joys ripens into a new want. nature, uncontainable, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking."
5298,1088-129236-0001.flac," in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a banavan in benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light. the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment of human life."
5299,1088-129236-0005.flac, and therefore i now incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love. but from these formidable sensors i shall appeal to my seniors.
5300,1088-129236-0003.flac," establishes marriage, and gives permanence to human society. the natural association of the sentiment of love with the hate of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints, which every youth and mage confess to be true to their throbbing experience."
5301,1088-129236-0013.flac," and what fastens attention, tension, tension in the intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between two parties. perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet them again. but we see the exchange of glance, or betray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers."
5302,1088-129236-0010.flac," which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment. he will shrink, shrink, shrink, and moan. alas, i know not why, but infinite compunctions imbiter in mature life through remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name."
5303,1088-129236-0006.flac," for it is to be considered, that it is littered, that this passion of which we speak, though it begin with a young, yet forcec's not the old, old, or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old."
5304,1088-129236-0007.flac," glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal heart of all, and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames."
5305,103-1241-0001.flac," or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filthy bloom. the air was always sweet with the breath of many apple orchards, and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple, while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer and all the year."
5306,103-1241-0027.flac," who had been stolen away from her parents and her infancy by, who had her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. i used to lie awake at night to imagine things like that, because i didn't have time in the day. i guess that's why i'm so, who would who will thin? i am dreadful to an a-dye. there isn't a pig on my bones."
5307,103-1241-0033.flac," i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously. this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this hard old, wincey dress. all the orphans had to wear them, you know. a merchant in hopes and last winter donated 300 yards of wincey to the asylum. some people said it was because he couldn't sell it."
5308,103-1241-0040.flac," there'd be no scope for the imagination then, with there. but am i talking too much? people are always telling me i do. would you— ling me i do? would you— ling me i do? would you rather i didn't talk? if you say so i'll stop. i can stop when i make up my mind to it, although it's difficult. matthew."
5309,103-1241-0022.flac," no matter what mistake it had been made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at gring, gring, gring, gring gables. i'm sorry i was late, he said shyly. come along. the horse is over in the yard. no, no, no, no, no, no, no. give me your bag. oh, i can carry it! the child responded cheerfully."
5310,103-1241-0024.flac," we've got to drive along peace, haven't we? mrs. spencer said it was eight miles. i'm glad because i love driving. oh, it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you. i've never belonged to anybody. not really. really? but the asylum was the worst. i've only been in it for four months, but that was enough."
5311,103-1241-0004.flac," and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty. in fact, he had looked at twenty, very looked at twenty, very looked at twenty, very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grain-ness. when he reached bright river, there was no sign of any train."
5312,103-1241-0005.flac," he thought he was too early, so he tied his horse in the yard of the small, bright river hotel, and went over to the station house. the long platform was almost deserted, the only living creature inside being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end."
5313,103-1241-0000.flac," chapter 2. matthew cuthbert is surprised. matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river. it was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamie fur wood to drive through."
5314,103-1241-0028.flac," i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump, plump, plump with dimples in my elbows. with this is ice, matthew's companions stop talking, partly because she was out of breath, and partly because they had- because they had reached the buggy. not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill."
5315,103-1241-0031.flac," i've never seen one, but i can imagine what she would look like. i don't ever expect to be a bride myself. i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me, unless it might be a foreign missionary. i suppose a foreign missionary might be very particular."
5316,103-1241-0010.flac," guess there's some mistake, date, date,"" he said. mrs. spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge. said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum, and that you would be along for her presently. that's all i know about it, and i haven't got any more orphans concealed here about."
5317,103-1241-0025.flac, it's worse than anything you can imagine. mrs. spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that.
5318,103-1241-0041.flac," was enjoying himself. like most quiet folks, he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talk talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse."
5319,103-1241-0035.flac," and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch and kid gloves, of some boots. i felt cheered up right away, and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might. i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. neither was mrs. spencer, although she generally is."
5320,103-1241-0038.flac," and i used to imagine i was living here, and living here, but i never really expected i would. it's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it? but those red roads are so funny, and they're so funny. when we got into the train at charlottetown in the red roads began to flash past, i asked mrs. spencer what made them red."
5321,103-1241-0036.flac," she said she hadn't time to get sick, watching to see that i didn't fall overboard. she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about. but if it kept her from being seasick, it's a mercy i did prowl, isn't it? and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity."
5322,103-1241-0011.flac," ""'i don't understand,' said matthew, helplessly, wishing that marilla was at hand to—hand to—hand to cope with the situation. ""'well, you'd better question the girl,' said the station-master carelessly—carelessly—carelessly. ""'i dare say she'll be able to explain. she's got a tongue of her own. that's certain.'"
5323,103-1241-0002.flac," matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them. for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road, whether you know them or not. matthew dreaded all women except marilla and mrs. rachel."
5324,103-1241-0016.flac," might have seen that the chin was very pointed, pointed and pronounced, that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity, that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive, might-lipped and expressive, that the forehead was broad and full. in short, our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded"
5325,103-1241-0006.flac," matthew, barely noticing that it was a girl, side-led pastor as quickly as possible without looking at her. had he looked, he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody."
5326,103-1241-0018.flac," i suppose you are mr. matthew cuthbert of green gables. she said in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice, i am very glad, glad, glad to see you. i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me."
5327,103-1241-0043.flac," and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes,"
5328,103-1241-0026.flac," they were good, you know, the asylum people. but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum. only just in the other, the other, the other orphans. it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them."
5329,103-1241-0039.flac," and she said she didn't know him for pity's signal to ask her any more questions. she said i must have asked her a thousand already. i suppose i had too, but how are you going to—and you're going to find out about things if you don't ask questions? and what does make the roads red? well, now? i don't know. sit, matthew."
5330,103-1241-0003.flac," he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him. he may have been quiet right and, and quiet right and thinking so, for he was an odd looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long, iron-gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders."
5331,103-1241-0017.flac," was so ludicrously afraid. matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first. for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her, she stood up, grasping with one thin, brown hand, the handle of a shabby old-fashioned carpet bag, the other she held out to him."
5332,103-1241-0015.flac," her face was small, white, white, white, and thin, also much freckled. her mouth was large and sober her eyes, which looked, and sober her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods, and gray in others. so far the ordinary observer, an extraordinary observer,"
5333,103-1241-0020.flac," i wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a while, cherry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y, all white with bloom, and- i- i'm in the moon shine, don't you think? you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you?"
5334,103-1241-0034.flac," but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you? when we got on the train, i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. but i just went to work and imagine that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress, because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worthwhile."
5335,103-1241-0012.flac," maybe they were out of boys, with the brand you wanted. he walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate matthew was left to do—was left to do—was left to do that, which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den. walk up to a girl, a strange girl, an orphan girl."
5336,103-1241-0023.flac," it isn't heavy. i've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy. and if it isn't carried in just a certain way, the handle pulls out, so i better keep it because i know the exact knack of it. it's an extremely old carpet bag. oh, i'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree."
5337,103-1241-0013.flac," and demanded her, at her, why she wasn't a boy. matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about, turned about, turned about, and shuffled gently down the platform towards her. she had been watching him ever since, ever since he had passed her, and she had her eyes on him now. matthew was not looking at her."
5338,103-1241-0007.flac," and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main. matthew encountered the station-master locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the 530 train would soon be along."
5339,103-1241-0029.flac," the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches, were several feet above their heads. the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy."
5340,103-1241-0030.flac," isn't that beautiful? what did that tree lean, leaning out from the bank, all white and lacy, make you think of, she asked, well now, i don't know, sit matthew. why, a bride, of course, a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil."
5341,103-1241-0042.flac," he detested the way they had of sideling past him timidly with sidewise glances, glances, glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they venture to say a word. that was the avenue he'd hidden the type of well-bred little girl, but this freckled which was very different."
5342,103-1241-0037.flac," oh, there are a lot more cherry trees all in blue. blue. this island is the bloomiest place. i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here. i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world."
5343,103-1241-0019.flac, i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me tonight
5344,103-1241-0032.flac," but i do hope that someday i shall have a white dress. that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. i just love pretty clothes. and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember. but of course, it's all the more to look forward to isn't it. and then..."
5345,103-1241-0021.flac, matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his. then in there he decided what to do. he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake. he would take her home and let marilla do that. she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow.
5346,103-1241-0008.flac," the 530 train has been in and gone half an hour ago, answered that brisk official. but there was a passenger dropped off for you, a little girl. she's sitting out there on the shingles. i asked her to go in—go into the lady's waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside."
5347,103-1241-0014.flac," a child of about eleven, garbed in a very very very very very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish grey wincey. she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids a very thick, decidedly red hair."
5348,103-1241-0009.flac," she's a case, i should say."
5349,103-1240-0010.flac," peter had asked, peter had asked him, of course, for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life. and yet, here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day, afternoon of a busy day, classically driving over the hollow and up the hill."
5350,103-1240-0031.flac," but there was a savings something about her mouth, mouth, mouth, which, if it had been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor. we're all pretty well,"" said mrs. rachel. i was kind of afraid you weren't, though, when i saw matthew starting off today. i thought maybe he was going to the doctors."
5351,103-1240-0013.flac," he was the shyest, heest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers, or to any place where he might have to have to talk. matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, with a buggy, with a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. mrs. rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it."
5352,103-1240-0042.flac," so in the end we decided to ask mrs. spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl. we heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart, smart, likely boy of about 10 or 11. we decided that would be the best stage."
5353,103-1240-0018.flac," had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men, without actually retreating into the woods when he found his homestead. greengables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land, and there it was to this day."
5354,103-1240-0000.flac," chapter 1 mrs. rachel lind is surprised. mrs. rachel lind lived just where the avonly main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies-earedrops, and traversed by a brook."
5355,103-1240-0027.flac," there were three plates laid, so that marilla must be expecting someone home with matthew to t. but the dishes were everyday dishes, and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company."
5356,103-1240-0057.flac," my, but i pity him. that's what. so said mrs. rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fullness of her heart."
5357,103-1240-0035.flac," said marilla, as if getting boys from orphaned asylum in nova scotia were part of the useful spring work on any well-regulated, avanely farm instead of being an unheard of innovation. mrs. rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. she thought in exclamation points."
5358,103-1240-0017.flac," the big, rambling, orchard-emboward house, where the cuth-birds lived, was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynn's hollow. to be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further. matthew cuth-birds father, as shy and silent as his son after him,"
5359,103-1240-0012.flac," had it been any other man in avonle, mrs. rachel, definitely putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions. but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him."
5360,103-1240-0050.flac," and then nova scotia is right close to the island. it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states. he can't be much different from ourselves. well, i hope it will turn out all right,"" said mrs. rachel, rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts."
5361,103-1240-0007.flac," anybody who went out of it, or into it, had to pass over that hill road, and so run the unseen gauntlet of, if mrs. rachel's all seeing eye. she was sitting there one afternoon in early june. the sun was coming in at the window, warm and bright."
5362,103-1240-0052.flac," as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy. i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up. i wondered mrs. alexander spencer for doing it, but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head."
5363,103-1240-0043.flac," old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off, and young enough to be trained out proper. we mean to give him a good home and schooling. we have old schooling. we have old schooling. we had a telegram from mrs. alexander spencer today, the mailman brought it from the station, saying they were coming on the 530 train tonight."
5364,103-1240-0033.flac," matthew went to bright river, getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia, and he's coming down the train tonight. if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia, mrs. rachel could not have been more astonished."
5365,103-1240-0045.flac," well, marilla, i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing, a risky thing, that's what. you don't know what you're getting, you're bringing a strange child into your house and home, and you don't know a single thing about him, or what his disposition is like, nor what sort of parents he had,"
5366,103-1240-0034.flac," she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. it was unsupposable that marilla was supposable, that marilla was supposable, that marilla was making fun of her, but mrs. rachel was almost forced to suppose it. are you an earnest? are you an earnest? are you an earnest marilla? she demanded when voice returned to her. yes, of course."
5367,103-1240-0005.flac," helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church 8 society and foreign missions auxiliary. yet with all this, mrs. piss, mrs. rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting cotton warp quilts. she had knitted 16 of them."
5368,103-1240-0026.flac," and here she sat now, knitting, and the table, table, table behind her was laid for supper. mrs. rachel, before she had fairly closed the door,"
5369,103-1240-0008.flac," the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridle flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. thomas lind, a meek little man whom, who, havingly people, called rachel lynn's husband, was sowing his late turnip seed on the hillfield beyond the barn."
5370,103-1240-0038.flac, mrs. alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopton in the spring.
5371,103-1240-0016.flac," yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. start him off. start him off. i'm clean puzzled, that's what, and i won't know a minute's piece of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avenue today. accordingly, after tea mrs. rachel set out, she had not far to go."
5372,103-1240-0004.flac," but mrs. rachel lind was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those, those, those of other folks into the bargain. she was a notable housewife. her work was always done and well done. she ran the sewing circle."
5373,103-1240-0019.flac," barely visible from the main road along which all the other avenue houses were so socially situated. mrs. raider schillend did not call living in such a place, living at all, but all. it's just staying, that's what she said, as she stepped along the deep-rutted grassy lane"
5374,103-1240-0056.flac," it seems uncanny to think of a child at greengables somehow. there's never been one there, for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built. if they ever were children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them, except them, i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything."
5375,103-1240-0011.flac," and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of avon lee. and he had the buggy and the soar all mayor, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance. now, where was matthew cuthbert going, and why was he going there?"
5376,103-1240-0014.flac," and her afternoon's enjoyment, and went with spoiled. i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone, and marilla where he's gone and why. the worthy woman, and woman finally concluded. he doesn't generally go to town this time of year, and he never visits."
5377,103-1240-0015.flac," if he'd run out of turnip seat, he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more."
5378,103-1240-0051.flac," only don't say- oh, don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strickening in the well. i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did- asylum child did that, and the whole family died in fearful agonies. only it was a girl in that instance. well, we're not getting a girl. timorilla."
5379,103-1240-0044.flac," so matthew went to the bride-river to meet him. mrs. spencer will drop him off there. of course, she goes on to wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe, and station herself. mrs. rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind. she proceeded to speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news."
5380,103-1240-0025.flac," once you got a glimpse of the bloom, white cherry trees and white cherry trees in the left orchard, and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook, hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines. here sat marilla cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine,"
5381,103-1240-0020.flac," bordered with wild rose bushes. it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves. trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were, there'd be enough of them. i'd rather look at people. to be sure."
5382,103-1240-0002.flac," for not even a brook, for brook, for brook, could run past mrs. rachel linsdor without due regard for decency and decorum. it probably was—see, and decorum. it probably was conscious that mrs. rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up."
5383,103-1240-0032.flac," morilla's lips. morilla's lips. morilla's lips. twitched, understandingly. she had expected mrs. rachel up. she had known that the sight of... the sight of matthew, jaunting off so unaccountably, would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity. oh, no. i'm quite well. although i had a bad headache yesterday, she said."
5384,103-1240-0021.flac," they seem contented enough, but then i suppose they're used to it. a body can get used to anything, even to being- being- being hanged, as the irishman said. with this mrs. rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables. very green and neat and precise was that yard."
5385,103-1240-0036.flac," marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum. well, the world was certainly turning upside down. she would be surprised at nothing after this. nothing."
5386,103-1240-0039.flac," so matthew and i have talked it over often on ever since. we thought we'd get a boy. matthew's getting up in years, you know. he's 60, and he isn't so spry as he once was. his heart troubles him a good deal, and you know how desperate hearted it's got to be to get hired help."
5387,103-1240-0024.flac," or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused, unused, unused parlor. its windows looked east and west. through the west, west, west, one, looking out on the backyard, came a flood of mellow june sunlight. but the east one?"
5388,103-1240-0046.flac," nor how he's likely to turn out. why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man in his wife-up west of the island took a boy out of an orphanest island and he set fire to the house at night, set it on purpose, marilla, and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds."
5389,103-1240-0028.flac," yet what of matthew's white collar in the sorrel mare? mrs. rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery, this unusual mystery about quiet, unmisterious green gables. good evening, rachel. morales said briskly. this is a real fine evening, isn't it? won't you sit down?"
5390,103-1240-0022.flac," set about on one side, and set side with great patriarchal willows, and the other with primal embodies. not a stray, stick-nor-stone was to be seen. formist's rachel would have seen it if there had been. privately, she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house."
5391,103-1240-0047.flac," and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs. they couldn't break him of it. if you had asked my advice in the matter, which you didn't do, marilla, i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing. that's what."
5392,103-1240-0048.flac," this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla. she- she knitted steadily on. i don't deny there's something in what you say, rachel. i've had some qualms myself. but matthew was terrible set on it. i could see that, so i gave in."
5393,103-1240-0049.flac," it's so seldom the matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in. and as for the risk, there's risks. erisk, there's risks. erisk, there's risks in pretty near everything that body does in this world. there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that. they don't always turn out well."
5394,103-1240-0041.flac," they may be all right, i'm not saying they're not, but no london street arabs for me,"" i said. give me a native born at least. they'll be a risk no matter who we get. but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian."
5395,103-1240-0023.flac, one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt. mrs. rachel wrapped smartly. rachel wrapped smartly. rachel wrapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bitten to do so. the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment.
5396,103-1240-0029.flac," how are all your folks? something that for lack, lack, lack of any other name might be called, friendship, existed and always had existed between marilla cuffbert and mrs. rachel, in spite of, or perhaps because of, their dissimilarity. marilla was a tall."
5397,103-1240-0053.flac," mrs. rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan. but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival, she concluded to go up the road to robert bells until the news. it would certainly make a sensation second to none."
5398,103-1240-0006.flac," as heavenly, at heavenly, at heavenly housekeepers were want to tell in odd voices, and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow, and wound up the steep red hill beyond."
5399,103-1240-0037.flac," what on earth puts such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly. this had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disproved. well, we've been thinking about it for some time. all winter, in fact, returned marilla."
5400,103-1240-0055.flac," it does really seem as if i must be dream, dream, dream, dreaming. well, i'm sorry for that poor young one, and no mistake. matthew and merrula don't know anything about children, and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather."
5401,103-1240-0003.flac," and that if she noticed anything odd, odd, odd, odd, or out of place, she would never rest until she had ferreted out the wise and wear-forged thereof. there are plenty of people in avonle and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighbours' business by dint of neglecting their own."
5402,103-1240-0040.flac," there's never anybody to be- it'd be had, but those stupid, half-grown little french boys. and as soon as you do get one broken to your ways and taught something, he's up, bent off to the lobster canneries or the states. at first matthew suggested getting a homeboy. a homeboy. but i said no, flat to that."
5403,103-1240-0001.flac," that had its source away back in the woods, the old cuthbert place. it was reputed to be an intricate headlong, that intricate headlong, intricate headlong broken its earlier course through those woods, with darks that secrets of pool and cascade. but by the time it reached lynn's hollow, it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream."
5404,103-1240-0054.flac," and mrs. rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. so she took herself away, somewhat to marilla's relief, for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of mrs. rachel's pessimism. while of all things that ever were or will be, ejaculated mrs. rachel when she was safely out in the lane,"
5405,103-1240-0030.flac," thin woman with angles and thin and thin and without curves. her dark hair showed some grey streaks and was all thin, thinny streaks and was all face streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind, with two wire hairpins thin, thin stuck aggressively through it. she looked like a woman of narrow experience in rigid conscience, which she was."
5406,103-1240-0009.flac," mrs. rachel knew that he ought, because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j. blair's store over at carmody. middy, middy. that he meant to sew his turn of seed the next afternoon."
5407,2893-139322-0048.flac," you will lose time. they will doubt if it is you, but they will mess about the council house. there you will find their leaders. your strength is there with them. supposed with them. supposed with them. supposed this is only a rumor."
5408,2893-139322-0005.flac," and blotted out at the picture. presently they left the way, and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward, and sloped downward, and so came to a descending lift, lift again. the appearance of things changed. even the pretense of architectural ornament disappeared."
5409,2893-139322-0028.flac," every now and then one would stop to cough. a shadowy, huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky."
5410,2893-139322-0007.flac," the blue canvas clothing was on man, woman, and child. many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery. endless, raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation"
5411,2893-139322-0002.flac," the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black seawater over arched by buildings, and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights. a string of black barges passed seward, manned by blue-clad men."
5412,2893-139322-0038.flac," but for the most part, this burnt part, this remnant that worked, worked hopelessly. all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night, calling for the master, and valiantly and noisily, keeping its arms."
5413,2893-139322-0036.flac," graham heard the song of the revolt during his long, unpleasant research in these places. and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learned that a number of these grunt-serves had seized their bread before their work was done. graham was ascending towards the ways again."
5414,2893-139322-0022.flac," in spite of every precaution, the labor policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed. beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby."
5415,2893-139322-0043.flac," and a swervy hunchback, ridiculously gay and green and gold, came leaping down the platform towards him, bawling again and again in good english. this is us, us, us, us, dogs doing. us, struck the nave. the master is betrayed. his voice was horse."
5416,2893-139322-0010.flac, who were directing their labors. the burly labors of the old victorian times had followed that dre horse and all such such such living force producers to extinction. the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine.
5417,2893-139322-0026.flac, and came to a little bridge that sp- sp- sp- sp- sp- and spanned a vault. looking over the parapet. grrrr. saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any- than- any- than any he had seen. three barges smothered in flowery dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felsbar.
5418,2893-139322-0025.flac," graham made some indignant comments. but, sire, we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple,"" said osano. in your days people could stand such crudities, they were near the barbaric by 200 years."
5419,2893-139322-0044.flac," he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris, and so passed shrieking, oh, strog the nave! for a moment, gramps did still. for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream."
5420,2893-139322-0001.flac," on their way, the platform crossed the thames twice and passed in the broad viaduct, viaduct, across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north. in both cases, his impression was swift and in both very vivid."
5421,2893-139322-0016.flac," they penetrated downward, ever downward, towards the working places. presently, they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways, as insorts platforms running on their rails far overhead, and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits."
5422,2893-139322-0040.flac," then a woman with a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran. what is—what is—what is—what is happened now?"" said graham, puzzled, for he could not understand their thick speech. then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting in english."
5423,2893-139322-0035.flac," even as these enemic millions, these enemic millions, these enemic millions were crushed by its complexity. and everywhere were pale features, lean limbs, in limbs, disfigurement and degradation. once and again, and again a third time,"
5424,2893-139322-0011.flac," the latter-day laborer, male as well as female, was essentially a machine-minder and feeder, a servant and attendant, or an artist under direction. the women, in comparison with those grand remembered,"
5425,2893-139322-0027.flac," by a multitude of coughing men, each guiding a little truck. the dust filled the place with a choking mist, by a- with a choking mist, and turned the electric glare yellow. the vague shadows of these workers just circulated about their feet, and rushed to and fro against the long stretch of whitewashed wall."
5426,2893-139322-0033.flac," the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill-lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places, in limitable, those sleeping places, in limitable vistas of pinpoint lights. here was the smell of tanning, and here the reek of a brewery."
5427,2893-139322-0037.flac," when he saw a number of blue-clad children running down a train, when he transverse passage, and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labor police, armed with clubs, trotting towards some unknown disturbance. and then came a remote disorder."
5428,2893-139322-0017.flac," the factories that were not working were not working were sparsely lighted. to graham, they and their shrouded isles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom, and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways."
5429,2893-139322-0004.flac," struck graham most vividly. one lank and very high carriage with longitude and no metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention on dooley. abruptly, the edge of the archway cut."
5430,2893-139322-0034.flac," and here, unprecedented reeks, everywhere were and reeks, everywhere were pillars and cross-archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen. thick tightens and tightens and tightens of greasy, shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world."
5431,2893-139322-0042.flac," he hesitated, looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew. but how can they know?"" asked pesano. graham heard someone shouting. stop all work! stop all work!"
5432,2893-139322-0020.flac, had the oddest effect. the work was beautifully executed.
5433,2893-139322-0032.flac," that walk left on graham's mind, on graham's mind, on graham's mind, amaze of memories, fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines, the racing threads of looms, the heavy beat of stamping machinery."
5434,2893-139322-0047.flac," he said, he might have known the hour has come. he thought swiftly, what am i to do? go back to the councilhouse, said asano. why should i not appeal? the people are here."
5435,2893-139322-0031.flac," the policeman who had shouted, glanced at his fellow, and gram, and gram saw him shrug his shoulders. shrug his shoulders. he made no further effort to stop the singing. and so they went through these, went through these, went through these factories and places of toil, seeing many painful and grim things."
5436,2893-139322-0046.flac, the masters betrayed! they cried. the masters betrayed! suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent.
5437,2893-139322-0041.flac," that men yelled to one another, that women took up screaming, that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this. ostrog has ordered the black police to london. the black police are coming from south africa. the black police. the black police."
5438,2893-139322-0039.flac, they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again. they became aware of the remote hooding and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices.
5439,2893-139322-0049.flac," it sounds true, siddhisano. let us have the facts,"" said graham."
5440,2893-139322-0008.flac," but wherever there was work, it was being done by slow-moving workers in blue canvas. the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the workplaces and the orange cloud labor police. and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls,"
5441,2893-139322-0051.flac, had not someone in the head had had windvane offices learned. he said a girl had had a girl? not. he said a girl. he did not know who she was. he was. who came out from the councilhouse crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins?
5442,2893-139322-0029.flac," their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro. and as they looked at the scene, some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing. stop that! shoud have won, they're from the policeman, but the order was disobeyed."
5443,2893-139322-0052.flac," and then another thing was shouted, something that turned in aimless tumult into determinate movements. it came like a wind along the street."
5444,2893-139322-0018.flac," he came to the warren of the jewelers, and with some difficulty, and by using his signature, obtained admission to these galleries. they were high and dark and rather cold. in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree,"
5445,2893-139322-0013.flac," to be brilliant physically or mentally, to be in any way attractive or exceptional, had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge, a line of escape to the pleasures, pleasures, pleasure city and its splendors and delights, and at last,"
5446,2893-139322-0015.flac," had been a diverse multitude, still had diverse multitude, still had a diverse multitude, still stirred by the tradition of personal honor and a high morality. now it was differentiating into an indistinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own, even with a dialect of its own."
5447,2893-139322-0030.flac," and first one, and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain, singing it defiantly, the song of the revolt. the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song. tramp, tramp, tramp."
5448,2893-139322-0021.flac," for the most part, intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif. these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves. they assumed this on coming to work, but at night"
5449,2893-139322-0024.flac," this is what i wanted to see, ee-e-e said graham. this is what i wanted to see, trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement. she might have done better with herself than that, said asano."
5450,2893-139322-0000.flac," chapter 21 on the underside. from the business quarter, they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city, where the bulk of the manufacture was done."
5451,2893-139322-0050.flac," even now the ruins may be impassable. graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him. they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one, and there asano acosta delabra, the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech. what did he say as graham?"
5452,2893-139322-0045.flac," he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and down to the roaring tears of platforms, and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past."
5453,2893-139322-0014.flac," to the euthanasia and peace. to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of mainly nourished souls. in the young cities of graham's former life, the newly aggregated laboring mass"
5454,2893-139322-0019.flac," each man at a little bench by himself, and with a little shaded light. the long vista of light patches, with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils, and the intent face, like the face of a ghost in each shadow,"
5455,2893-139322-0012.flac," whereas a class distinctly plain and flat-chested. 200 years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion, 200 years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigor from the blue canvas myriads."
5456,2893-139322-0023.flac," many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chance to be much in fashion. osano apologized to graham for this offensive sight, but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route."
5457,2893-139322-0003.flac," the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly. here too, the distinctive blue of the labor department was in abundance. the smoothness of the double tracks."
5458,2893-139322-0006.flac," the lights diminished in number and size. the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached. and in the dusty, biscuit-making place of the potters, among the fell spar mills, in the furnace rooms of the metal workers,"
5459,2893-139322-0009.flac," the voluntary vigors of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces, the feeble muscles, the muscles, and weary eyes of many of the latter-day workers. such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few galley-dressed managers and four women."
5460,2893-139310-0053.flac," with the torrent dipping to flo beneath, and shouting up at him, with—he did not know whether he went, he did not—with—he did not want to know. he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall."
5461,2893-139310-0045.flac," a tall, saloed dark haired, shining-eyed youth, white clad from a-eyed youth, white clad from top to toe, clamored up towards the platform, shouting loyally, and sprang down again, and receded looking backward. heads, shoulders,"
5462,2893-139310-0039.flac," her hair crossed her face and brownish and green staff. next, this group, an old care-worn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty. and behind, shouted a hairless face, a great cavity of toothless mouth, a voice called"
5463,2893-139310-0030.flac," lincoln was shouting in his ear, but graham was deafened to that. all the others saved the woman just tick-tick-tick-tick-tulated towards the hall. he perceived what had happened to the upper-ar, the whole mass of people with-withbobble was chanting together. it was not simply a song."
5464,2893-139310-0018.flac," no one expected you to wake. no, no wake. wake. they were cunning. damn, tyrants. but they were taken by surprise. they did not know whether to drug you hypnotize you or kill you. again, the hall dominated everything. ostrog is at the wind vein offices. ready."
5465,2893-139310-0025.flac," but why these things should be so? he could not understand. the door opened. lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned, and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult. these intruders came towards him."
5466,2893-139310-0021.flac, mast in the inaudible. it is now or never the council is rocking. they cannot trust even their drilled men. hear the people calling to you. graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds.
5467,2893-139310-0047.flac," most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly white, and mo- mo- and disease was there, and many a hand that waived- mo- mo- waived to him was gaunt and lean. men and women of the new age, strange and incredible meeting, mo- meeting, as the broad stream passed before him to the right,"
5468,2893-139310-0050.flac," at lincoln's pressure, he turned toward the archway, walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it. the multitude, the gesture and song all moved in that direction."
5469,2893-139310-0049.flac," mingled in the ranks. tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. the whole world seemed marching. tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. his brain was tramping. the garments waved onward. the faces poured by more abundantly. tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp."
5470,2893-139310-0051.flac," the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet. he was aware of a path before him, of a sweet about him, of guards and dignities, and lincoln on his right hand."
5471,2893-139310-0020.flac," even now he may be doing that. then this public theater, bald the man in yellow, it's only a contingent. we have five myriads, drilled men. we have arms, cried lincoln. we have plans, a leader."
5472,2893-139310-0035.flac," he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln. he perceived the girl in gray close to him, her face lit, her gesture onward. for the instant she became to him to him flushed in eager as she was, an embodiment of the song."
5473,2893-139310-0044.flac," a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right. he perceived a blue-clad negro, a strivelled woman in yellow, then a glow, then a glow, then a group of tall, fair-haired white-faced blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him. he noted to china men."
5474,2893-139310-0023.flac," on the one hand was the white council, powerful, disciplined, few."
5475,2893-139310-0029.flac, but a moment that was near to panic passed. he tried to make audible inquiries of
5476,2893-139310-0033.flac," the strength of that chant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him. the hall opened to him."
5477,2893-139310-0026.flac," and lincoln, gesticulating. the voices, the voices, and the voices without explained their soundless lips. show us the sleeper, show us the sleeper, show us the sleeper, was the burden of the upper-er. men were balling for order, silence!"
5478,2893-139310-0038.flac," the whole multitude was swaying and congested masses. individual figures sprang out of the tumult, impressed him, and momentarily lost definition again. close to the platform, the platform, the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by three men."
5479,2893-139310-0042.flac," march, his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words. he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting, onward, they were no longer marking time, they were marching, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, in that host."
5480,2893-139310-0024.flac," monstrous crowds, packed masses of indistinguishable people clamoring his name, hailing, clamoring his name, hailing, clamoring his name, hailing him master. the other side had imprisoned him, debated his death. these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him."
5481,2893-139310-0037.flac," the hall was a vast and intricate space, galleries, balconies, broad spaces of amphitheatial steps, and great archways. far away, high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity."
5482,2893-139310-0027.flac," a waving, incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces, men and women together, waving pale blue garments together, waving pale blue garments together, waving pale blue garments extended hands. many were standing, one man in rags, open in rags, and in rags of dark brown, a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth."
5483,2893-139310-0043.flac," were bearded men, old men, youths, fluttering robed, bare-armed women, girls, men and women of the new age, rich robes, grey rags fluttered together in the world of their movement amidst the dominant blue."
5484,2893-139310-0046.flac," hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences. faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, there, eyes met his and passed and vanished, vanished, vanished. men gesticulated to him, shouted in audible personal things."
5485,2893-139310-0031.flac," the voices were gathered together and up-born by a torrent of instrumental music, music like the music of an organ."
5486,2893-139310-0041.flac," flashed and slanted. then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him, passing to the front of him, passing towards a great archway, shouting, to the council, tram, tram, tram, tram, tram, tram. he raised his arm, and the roaring was redoubled."
5487,2893-139310-0019.flac," even now there's a rumor of fighting beginning. the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him. oh, strog has it planned. trust him. we have our ever-ever organizations ready. we shall seize the flying stages."
5488,2893-139310-0032.flac," full of flaunting banners, full of the mart, full of mart, march and pageantry of opening war, and the feet of the people were beating time. trump! trump! he was urged towards the door. he obeyed mechanically."
5489,2893-139310-0048.flac," tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust, truth thrust downward in an incessant, trippin' incessant, trippin' incessant replacement of people. tram, tram, tram, tram. the unit, tribunison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages, men and women,"
5490,2893-139310-0022.flac," now dark and hopeless, hopeless, now clear and ghastly. he was master of the earth. he was a man sodden with thong snow. of all his fluctuating impressions, the dominant ones presented an antagonism."
5491,2893-139310-0028.flac," he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes. what did these people expect from him? he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating, marching. his own mind, too, changed."
5492,2893-139310-0040.flac," ostrug. all his impressions were vague, vague, save the massive emotion of that trampling song. the multitude were beating time with their feet, marking time. jam, jam, jam, jam. the great weapons waved."
5493,2893-139310-0036.flac," he emerged in the alcove again, and, contentedly, the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting. guided by lincoln's hand, he marched ablyically across the center of the stage facing the people."
5494,2893-139310-0034.flac," ""'wave your arm to them,' said lincoln. ""'wave your arm to them!' ""'this,' said a voice on the other side. he must have this.' arms were about his neck, detaining him in the doorway, and a black, subtly folded mantle hung from his shoulders."
5495,2893-139310-0052.flac," attendance intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left, before him when the backs of the guards in black, three and three and three. he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway."
5496,2893-139310-0012.flac," the people in the little room could not hear each other shout. graham stood, his intelligence clinging help helplessly to the thing he had just heard. the council – hear he – he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a name that had struck him, who heard what he said."
5497,2893-139310-0016.flac, he's at the the the the wind vein offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannized at last even in my name my name master
5498,2893-139310-0009.flac," councillors under the atlas. why should they try to drop, drop, drop, drop me?"" ""'to keep you insensible,' said the man in yellow, to prevent you. lo to prevent your interference.'"
5499,2893-139310-0014.flac, our leader in your name. in my name...
5500,2893-139310-0011.flac," threaded by one monotonous voice. now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came a deafening tumult, roaring and thundering, cheer, crowded on cheer, voice, through, crowded on cheer, voices, horse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted,"
5501,2893-139310-0007.flac," he did not believe he heard a right. he resisted the persuasion. he pretended not to understand, not to hear. he lifted his voice again. i have been awake three days of prisoner, three days"
5502,2893-139310-0015.flac," why is he not here? he has deputed us. i am his brother, his half-brother, lincoln. he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come onto him. that is why he has sent."
5503,2893-139310-0000.flac," the people march. he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention, looked up, and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment. he took the dose forth with, and in a moment he was glowing."
5504,2893-139310-0003.flac," a partially open door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering, clapping, and shouting that died away and began again, and rose to a thunderous pitch."
5505,2893-139310-0013.flac," but who is ostrug, he said?"
5506,2893-139310-0006.flac," his eyes searched their faces. they've told him nothing cried the girl. tell me, tell me cried graham. you are the master of the earth. you are owner of the world."
5507,2893-139310-0005.flac," he grasped the arm of this shouting person. tell me, he cried, who am i? who am i? the others came nearer to me. the others came nearer to hear his words."
5508,2893-139310-0004.flac," and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room. he watched the lips of the man in black, and gathered that he was making some explanation. he stared stupidly for some moments at these things, and then stood up abruptly."
5509,2893-139310-0008.flac," it is london. yes,"" said the younger man. and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas, how does it concern me?"
5510,2893-139310-0001.flac," a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half-open door into the hall. this man was shouting close to his ear, and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous upper-er from the great theater."
5511,2893-139310-0017.flac, the young man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder.
5512,2893-139310-0010.flac," because you are the atlas sire. who are the atlas sire? who are the atlas sire?"" said the man and yellow. the world is on your shoulders. they rule it in your name. the sounds from the hall had died into a silence."
5513,2893-139310-0002.flac," behind the man was a girl in a silvery gray robe, gray robe, whom graham, even in this confusion, perceived to be beautiful. her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on him. on him, her lips trembled apart."
5514,289-121665-0046.flac," and now, little bow peep, no more did weep. my tail of tails ends here."
5515,289-121665-0026.flac," gazed below her. quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her tront flock, looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle chepherdess. bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them."
5516,289-121665-0037.flac," and after pondering the matter for a time, she became, time she became discouraged, and thinking she was no better off than before the tales were found. she began to weep and to be wail her misfortune. but amidst her tears, she bethought herself of her needle and thread."
5517,289-121665-0034.flac," and bobepheap had fully decided to seek for the tales and find them before she related the story of their loss to anyone. each day, for many days after that, little bobepheap wandered about the hills seeking the tales of her sheep."
5518,289-121665-0020.flac," and doesn't know where to find them, but leave them alone and they'll come home, all wagging their tails behind them. little bow peep and behind them. little bow peep and behind them. little bow peep sat still and watched the old and still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hillside and disappear over the top. by and by she thought,"
5519,289-121665-0030.flac," so you have found-ound your sheep, deary,"" she said in her cracked voice. yes, replied little bo peep, with difficulty repressing a sob. but look, mother, they've all left their tails behind them. why so they have? explain the old woman."
5520,289-121665-0024.flac," she decided she would not wait any longer. so up she took her little crook, determined for to find them, and began in and climbing the hill. when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about."
5521,289-121665-0045.flac," so now little one, run one, run one, run away home, and try to be more thoughtful in the future. your sheep will never miss the tails."
5522,289-121665-0004.flac," fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash, and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair. all the shepherds and shepherdises upon the hills, both young and old, full, full. soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed."
5523,289-121665-0033.flac," but soon the son began to sink over the hilltops, and she knew she must take her sheep home, take her sheep home, take her sheep home before night overtook them. she did not tell her mother of her misfortune, for she feared the old shepherds would scold her."
5524,289-121665-0018.flac," that she began to cough and this made the go remember that her flock had strayed away. i really must go and find my sheep, she said, rising to her feet, and then i shall be sure to notice their tails and see if they wag them. sit still, my child!"
5525,289-121665-0025.flac," only a green valley and another hill beyond. now really alarm for the safety of her charge, bopey parade into the valley and up the farther hillside. panting and tired, she reached the summit and, pausing breathlessly,"
5526,289-121665-0013.flac," oh, yes, they know me, everyone. and do not you know the sheep? i can call everyone by name. my name, said bo peep confidently. for though i am so young a shepherdess, i am fond of my sheep, and know all about them."
5527,289-121665-0032.flac," and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley. bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep, and so, driving them before her, she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost tales."
5528,289-121665-0028.flac," nothing was left to eat sheep, but a wee little stump where a tail should be, and little bow peep was so heartbroken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly."
5529,289-121665-0005.flac," and there were many willing hands to aid her if, which was not often, she needed their assistance. bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage, and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon the mound and,"
5530,289-121665-0001.flac," and started out with her sheep, that sheep, that and sheep, that they might feed upon the tender, juicy grasses with which the and grasses with which the hills abounded. the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side"
5531,289-121665-0000.flac," and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means. they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills, and each morning the mother took her crook and went to the house."
5532,289-121665-0040.flac," came hobbling to us, cares, cares side and asked, what are you doing with my cat tails? your cat tails replied, bo peepin' surprise. what do you mean? why these tails are all cut from white pussy cats, and i put them on the tree to dry."
5533,289-121665-0029.flac," but after a while, the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lamkins. so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes, and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her."
5534,289-121665-0021.flac," very soon i shall see the sheep coming back, but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance. soon the head of the little shepherds began to nod."
5535,289-121665-0015.flac," then you are wiser than most people. and if people. and if people. and if you know all about them. and you also know they will come, until know they will come home of their own accord. and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual."
5536,289-121665-0043.flac," no one in this world knows all, in this world knows all about anything. sheep do not have long tails. there is only a little stump, only a little stump, only a little stump to answer for a tail. neither do rabbits have tap-tales, nor bears, nor many other animals."
5537,289-121665-0007.flac," good morning, little boat-paper, and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon it on a short stick. she was bent nearly double by weight of many years. her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals."
5538,289-121665-0010.flac," and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy finger so up the seams of the new frock she was making. buying by and i the woman asked, why do you come out here to sew? because i am a shepherdess replied the girl."
5539,289-121665-0027.flac," but when she came near, she stopped in amazement and held up her little hands with a pretty expression of dismay. she had found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed."
5540,289-121665-0016.flac," oh, said little boat-peepin' surprise. do they wag their tails? i never noticed that. indeed, exclaimed the old one. then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep."
5541,289-121665-0009.flac," good morning, mother. can i do anything for you? no, dearie, return the woman in a cracked voice, but i will sit by your side and rest for time. the girl made room on the mound beside her."
5542,289-121665-0019.flac," so the old woman, i'm going over the hilltop myself, out myself, and i will send the sheep back to you. so she got upon her feet, and her feet, and began climbing the hill, and the girl hurt her saying as she walked away. little bobiep has lost her sheep."
5543,289-121665-0023.flac," but as it was now time for luncheon, she opened her little basket and eight of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her. after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring nearby,"
5544,289-121665-0038.flac," why, she exclaimed, smiling again, i can sew them on, of course, of course. then, she heaved a sigh and wiped, d sigh and wiped her eye and ran over hill and day low, and tried what she could, as a shepherd is should, to tack to each sheep its tail low."
5545,289-121665-0035.flac," and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious. but there is an end to all, end to all, end to all troubles, no matter how severe they may seem to be. and it happened one day as bo peep did stray onto a meadow hard by."
5546,289-121665-0011.flac," but where is your crook?"" on the grass beside me. and where are your sheep?"" bo peep looked up and could not see them. they must have strayed over the top of the hill, she said, and i will go and seek them."
5547,289-121665-0022.flac," little bow peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleeding. bleeding. but when she awoke, she found it a joke, joke, for still they were a fleeting. the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill."
5548,289-121665-0017.flac," perhaps you have never noticed their tales at all. no, answer the boatpeap thoughtfully. i don't know that i ever have. the woman laughed so hard at this reply."
5549,289-121665-0003.flac," decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself. she was a little might of a child, with flowing that brown locks, and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths. she wore light grey frock,"
5550,289-121665-0012.flac," do not be in a hurry, croaked the old woman. they will return presently without your troubling to find them. do you think so, aspo peep? of course. do not the sheep know you?"
5551,289-121665-0041.flac," what are you doing with them? i thought they belonged to my sheep, onto my sheep, onto my sheep, answered bo peep's sarfly."
5552,289-121665-0002.flac," upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the use and lambs, so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient chepherdess. so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage, little bo peep, as she was called,"
5553,289-121665-0042.flac," i must hunt until i find those that belong to my sheep. my dear, dear said the old woman. i have been deceiving you. you said you knew all about your sheep. i'm about your sheep. i'm about your sheep. and i wanted to teach you a lesson. for however wise we may be."
5554,289-121665-0006.flac," lang aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons, devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her mending stockings for her aged mother. one day, while thus occupied,"
5555,289-121665-0036.flac," the little shepherdus was overjoyed at this discovery, and reaching up her crook, she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock. but how to fasten them on to her sheep again was the question."
5556,289-121665-0039.flac," but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail and ran away from her, and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged. she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met"
5557,289-121665-0008.flac," deep wrinkles seemed her face in hands, while her nose and chin were so, were so, were so pointed that they nearly met. she was not pleasant to look upon, but bow peep had learned to be polite to the aged, so she answered sweetly."
5558,289-121665-0044.flac," and if you have been observing, you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them, and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found."
5559,289-121665-0014.flac," the old woman chuckled softly, as if the answer amused her and replied, replied, no one knows all about anything, my dear. but i know all about my sheep. protested little boatpeap. do you indeed?"
5560,289-121665-0031.flac," and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her. what do you suppose has become of their tales as the girl? oh, someone has proudly cut them off. they make nice tippets in wintertime, you know."
5561,289-121652-0024.flac," is of about the same date as boston's. they're lived, they're lived, they're lived in a town in sussex, about x, about the year 1704, an old woman named martha gooch. she was a capital nurse, a capital nurse, and in great demand to care for newly born babies. therefore,"
