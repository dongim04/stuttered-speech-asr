198-126831-0043,we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door he stared at us in the moonlight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

198-126831-0049,i shall tell it too i don't care if the joke is as much on myself as any one a story is a story no matter who it's on but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown ups always do it i never will when i'm grown up i'll remember better,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

103-1241-0042,he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0002,but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one,[0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
198-129977-0003,he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0007,which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0010,i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0014,but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0019,he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister's hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise,"[0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0020,that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0021,she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

198-129977-0022,that it was exactly the shade of her own edward's embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said,"[3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0

2518-154825-0047,thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2518-154825-0049,i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gulls seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3

1088-134315-0027,this interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of kara's correspondence,"[0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2518-154825-0052,now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0

2518-154825-0053,so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskew's body,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2518-154825-0054,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright of falling left me in a moment,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2518-154825-0056,thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us,"[0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2518-154826-0000,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver grey film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2518-154826-0001,with the straight sunpath across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2518-154826-0004,there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

289-121665-0037,and after pondering the matter for a time she became discouraged and thinking she was no better off than before the tails were found she began to weep and to bewail her misfortune but amidst her tears she bethought herself of her needle and thread,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0

2952-408-0005,the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2952-408-0006,strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0007,but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death when i came for though i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me i could have performed the service before your departure,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1088-134318-0008,yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0008,as it is i shall perform the service after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0009,then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the adjoining room having been told of the priest's kind promises came to thank him after which the master of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell,"[0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0

2952-408-0010,by the rule of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are unable to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning,"[0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0

2952-408-0011,all then left the house except the priest who went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp tomyo was burning,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0012,the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2952-408-0013,but when the hush of the night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2952-408-0014,he saw that shape lift the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginning at the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body,"[0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0

2952-408-0015,turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0016,and looked about the room no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverent sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0017,all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible but the law of our village as i told you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1088-134318-0009,bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0018,and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been broken heretofore some great misfortune has followed whenever it is obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0019,then muso told of the dim and awful shape that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0020,what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time muso then inquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0

2952-408-0021,the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village answered muso i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0022,and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0023,for it was evident that his kind hosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0024,and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2952-408-0025,you need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter said muso you directed me to the village yonder where i was very kindly treated and i thank you for that favor i can give no man shelter the recluse made answer,"[0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0]"
2952-408-0026,so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rites only as a matter of business,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0027,i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and because of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1088-134318-0010,muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0028,since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverend sir,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-408-0029,help me by your prayers i entreat you so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0

2952-410-0001,but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone and as his heart remained true to his former lord he preferred to give up the world so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest taking the buddhist name of kwairyo,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-410-0003,so he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside he lay down there and prepared to sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]
2952-410-0004,he had always welcomed discomfort and even a bare rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow his body was iron and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0

2952-410-0006,and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of great surprise what kind of a man can you be good sir that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this there are haunters about here many of them are you not afraid of hairy things,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-410-0023,and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night kwairyo felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2952-410-0044,kwairyo laughed long and loudly at these questions and then he said sirs i did not fasten the head to my sleeve it fastened itself there much against my will and i have not committed any crime for this is not the head of a man it is the head of a goblin,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0000,one hot night in hindustan a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice and they hoped they were going to sleep but they never did presently they became more broad awake than ever,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1502-122619-0061,magua had not only maintained his seat but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge,[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0001,at the sound of a howl outside the palace listen to that tiger remarked the king tiger replied the queen how should there be a tiger inside the city it was only a jackal i tell you it was a tiger said the king and i tell you that you were dreaming,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0002,if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen i say it was a tiger cried the king don't contradict me nonsense snapped the queen it was a jackal and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at last very well,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0003,we'll call the guard and ask and if it was a jackal i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away and if it was a tiger then you shall go and i will marry a new wife as you like answered the queen there isn't any doubt which it was,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0004,so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them but whilst the dispute was going on the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0005,mind you declare that the king is right it certainly was a jackal but if we say so the king will probably not keep his word about going away and we shall get into trouble so we had better take his side to this the other agreed,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
6925-80680-0006,the king made no remark but sent for a palanquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her in spite of her tears she was forced to obey,"[0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0007,and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0008,and started home again now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back so she stayed quite still for a long time listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0009,but heard none after a while she grew nervous for she was all alone and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0010,but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions there was no sign of any human being then her spirit gave way and she began to cry it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest,"[0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1502-122619-0062,and apparently as unconcerned as if he had no interest in the result,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0011,where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbours as it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house but was awakened by the sound of weeping he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could and into the forest towards the place the sound came from,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0012,and when she had told her story the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on and in the farm a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named ameer ali,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0013,years passed without a sign from the king his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care though the queen still lived with the farmer and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong handsome and healthy youth out in the forest they seemed far from the world,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0014,very few ever came near them and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living but she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait until,"[0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0015,at last when he was eighteen years of age they had not the heart to forbid him any longer,[0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6925-80680-0017,many a weary mile he tramped day after day until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred and he stepped joyfully into it like one who goes to meet an old friend,"[0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0018,presently as he made his way through a thicket he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner so he fired a pellet at it from his galail but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter at the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0019,and on reaching the spot he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0020,the old woman's face brightened she showed him where to seek the water and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim she led the way without a word and he followed in a short while they came to a hut in the forest,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0021,and as they drew near it ameer ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on at the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut and much as he wished to see her again,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0

6925-80680-0022,ameer ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back and so with a heavy heart he made his salutation and bade the old woman farewell but when he had gone a little way she called after him if ever you are in trouble or danger,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0023,come to where you now stand and cry fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me now and i will listen to you the prince thanked her and continued his journey but he thought little of the old woman's saying and much of the lovely damsel,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0024,shortly afterwards he arrived at a city and as he was now in great straits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0025,the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0026,and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous this was just what ameer ali wanted and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0027,soon after this on a dark and stormy night when the river roared beneath the palace walls the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter but the servant falling on his knees in terror,"[0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0028,begged that he might not be sent on such an errand particularly on a night so wild when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad indeed so frightened was he that the king who was very kind hearted bade another to go in his stead,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0029,but each one showed the same strange fear then ameer ali stepped forward this is my duty your majesty he said i will go the king nodded and off he went the night was as dark as pitch,"[0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0030,but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water inch by inch and foot by foot he fought his way across now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy now narrowly escaping,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0031,being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream at length he emerged panting and dripping wet on the other side close by the bank stood a gallows and on the gallows hung the body of some evildoer,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0032,whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0033,or of the roaring river as for ghosts and witches they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman what ails you he said now the woman was not really a woman at all,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0

6925-80680-0034,but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth if ever a man strayed into witchland the ogresses used to eat him up and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper,"[0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0035,in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue so when ameer ali questioned her she replied ah kind sir it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows help me to get him down and i will bless you for ever,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0036,ameer ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0037,and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back which she did very nimbly then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6925-80680-0039,and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness ameer ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0040,and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace when he had finished his story he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king who like everyone else was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it indeed,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0041,ameer ali himself was astonished for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since the king was delighted at its beauty and having praised and rewarded ameer ali he gave the anklet to his daughter a proud and spoiled princess,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0042,now in the women's apartments in the palace there hung two cages in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling and these two birds could talk as well as human beings they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0044,that was the parrot's name how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel think snapped the parrot who was cross because they hadn't given him his bath that morning i think she looks like a washerwoman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0048,and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels were to be got but though he sought night and day he never found one to compare with the anklet at last only a week remained and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the fairy of the forest,"[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0049,therefore away he went and after a day's travelling he reached the cottage in the forest and standing where he had stood when the old woman called to him he cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me help me,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0

6925-80680-0050,then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten what is the matter she asked in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1502-122619-0066,now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0051,then he told her his story and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart and then turning to him she said,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
6925-80680-0052,and hold it over the cauldron and every drop of blood that falls from it into the water will become a jewel next you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet and the one at my feet stands at my head and place the severed foot against the wound and it will heal,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0

6925-80680-0053,and i shall become quite well again as before at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0054,at length she persuaded him to do her bidding he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off she lay as one lifeless but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0055,and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems his heart took courage very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron and he quickly changed the wands placed the severed foot against the wound and immediately the two parts became one as before,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0056,then the maiden opened her eyes sprang to her feet and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut and would not come out or speak to him any more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0057,but three rare and beautiful anklets and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts and the next day the vain princess put two anklets on each foot,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0058,and strutted up and down in them admiring herself in the mirrors that lined her room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0059,and never recovered his temper until after lunch she's got all her beauty at one end of her now if she had a few of those fine gew gaws round her neck and wrists she would look better but now to my mind,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0060,she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up poor princess she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1502-122619-0067,in front of the encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect it might have been half an hour before each individual including even the women and children was in his place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0061,and then she declared to her father that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die again the king sent for ameer ali and ordered him to get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month or be put to a cruel death,"[0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0062,and again ameer ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0063,once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0064,and her head her words turned ameer ali pale with horror but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before and at last he consented to do as she bade him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0065,from her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0066,then the head and hands were joined on to the body and left neither sign nor scar full of gratitude ameer ali tried to speak to her but she ran into the house and would not come back and he was forced to leave her,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0067,when on the day appointed ameer ali produced a necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless than the last the king's astonishment knew no bounds and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0068,the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0069,how do you think our princess is looking now very fine no doubt grumbled the parrot but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only she ought to have a husband why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things,"[2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
6925-80680-0070,then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry ameer ali,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1502-122619-0068,the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain,[0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925-80680-0071,so the king sent for ameer ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honour of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne on hearing this speech,"[0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0]"
6925-80680-0072,ameer ali bowed low and answered that he had done and would do the king all the service that lay in his power save only this one thing the king who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man flew into a passion and the princess was more furious still,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0073,ameer ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find and ordered to be kept there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
6925-80680-0074,so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighbouring countries proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and heir to the throne should present himself at the palace when the day came all the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men young and old,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
6925-80680-0075,who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone else to gain both the throne and the princess as soon as the king was seated he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0076,well hasten then said the king i have no time to waste your majesty said the farmer has now lived and administered justice long in this city,[0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6925-80680-0078,no your majesty answered the farmer i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered to day to try and claim your daughter and kingdom every city has sent them and they wait hungry and eager but do not o king mistake or pretend again,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]"
6925-80680-0079,to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger the king turned first red and then pale there is continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne where,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0080,growing pale as he listened in prison replied the farmer if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals i will explain clear the court commanded the king and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace now,"[0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1502-122619-0069,its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
103-1240-0042,so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0081,then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up ameer ali and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside at the sight of her the king was filled with shame and self reproach and wished he could have lived his life over again,"[0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0

6925-80680-0082,and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death my day is past said he and he gave up his crown to his son ameer ali who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne,"[0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0083,there is only one person i will marry said he and this time the maiden did not run away but agreed to be his wife so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily as for the old woman whose pitcher ameer ali had broken,"[0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0

6925-80680-0084,she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she gladly returned to fairyland the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife any more if he even looks as if he does not agree with her,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

6925-80680-0085,she smiles at him and says is it the tiger then or the jackal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0000,after twenty four eventful hours our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0001,a broad and original thinker as you are thought is one matter rash inconsiderate action quite another and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of miss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0002,and bit his lower lip and considered we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite,[0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0003,she could for example be left behind with the luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammont there was no immediate reply,"[0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

7067-76047-0004,for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum i object to miss grammont and that side of the thing more than i do to miss seyffert,"[0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0

1502-122619-0070,standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious discussion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0005,sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seyffert has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

7067-76047-0006,on the second occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0007,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0008,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeed and almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady of very good social position indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7067-76047-0009,she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable self control and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say,"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

7067-76047-0011,am i said doctor martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party,"[0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0

7067-76047-0012,there were some moments of silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said doctor martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity,"[0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4
