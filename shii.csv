0,441-128982-0000,when the little fleet of spanish vessels including the one which had been captured by bartholemy portuguez and his men were on their way to campeachy they met with very stormy weather so that they were separated and the ship which contained bartholemy and his companions arrived first at the port for which they were bound,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1,441-128982-0001,the captain who had bartholemy and the others in charge did not know what an important capture he had made he supposed that these pirates were ordinary buccaneers and it appears that it was his intention to keep them as his own private prisoners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2,441-128982-0002,for as they were all very able bodied men they would be extremely useful on a ship but when his vessel was safely moored and it became known in the town that he had a company of pirates on board,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3,441-128982-0003,and who had heard of his various exploits he therefore went to the captain of the vessel and informed him that he had on board one of the very worst pirates in the whole world whose wicked deeds were well known in various parts of the west indies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4,441-128982-0004,and who ought immediately to be delivered up to the civil authorities this proposal however met with no favor from the spanish captain who had found bartholemy a very quiet man and could see that he was a very strong one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5,441-128982-0005,and he did not at all desire to give up such a valuable addition to his crew but the merchant grew very angry for he knew that bartholemy had inflicted great injury on spanish commerce and as the captain would not listen to him he went to the governor of the town and reported the case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6,441-128982-0006,when this dignitary heard the story he immediately sent a party of officers to the ship and commanded the captain to deliver the pirate leader into their charge the other men were left where they were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7,441-128982-0007,but he did not lose heart and immediately set to work to free himself from his irons which were probably very clumsy affairs at last caring little how much he scratched and tore his skin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8,441-128982-0008,he succeeded in getting rid of his fetters and could move about as freely as a tiger in a cage to get out of this cage was bartholemy's first object it would be comparatively easy because in the course of time some one would come into the hold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9,441-128982-0009,and the athletic buccaneer thought that he could easily get the better of whoever might open the hatch but the next act in this truly melodramatic performance would be a great deal more difficult for in order to escape from the ship it would be absolutely necessary for bartholemy to swim to shore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10,441-128982-0010,and he did not know how to swim which seems a strange failing in a hardy sailor with so many other nautical accomplishments in the rough hold where he was shut up our pirate peering about anxious and earnest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11,441-128982-0011,he was satisfied that this unwieldy contrivance would support him in the water among other things he had found in his rummagings about the hold was an old knife and with this in his hand he now sat waiting for a good opportunity to attack his sentinel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
12,441-128982-0012,this came soon after nightfall a man descended with a lantern to see that the prisoner was still secure let us hope that it was not the soldier who had kindly informed him of his fate and as soon as he was fairly in the hold bartholemy sprang upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
13,441-128982-0013,there was a fierce struggle but the pirate was quick and powerful and the sentinel was soon dead then carrying his two jars bartholemy climbed swiftly and noiselessly up the short ladder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
14,441-128982-0014,for a moment he sank below the surface but the two air tight jars quickly rose and bore him up with them there was a bustle on board the ship there was some random firing of muskets in the direction of the splashing which the watch had heard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
15,441-128982-0015,but none of the balls struck the pirate or his jars and he soon floated out of sight and hearing kicking out with his legs and paddling as well as he could with one hand while he held on to the jars with the other he at last managed to reach the land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
16,441-128982-0016,and ran as fast as he could into the dark woods beyond the town bartholemy was now greatly in fear that when his escape was discovered he would be tracked by bloodhounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
17,441-128982-0017,which was what he wished to do if the hounds should get upon his trail he was a lost man the desperate pirate therefore determined to give the bloodhounds no chance to follow him and for three days he remained in a marshy forest in the dark recesses of which he could hide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
18,441-128982-0018,and where the water which covered the ground prevented the dogs from following his scent he had nothing to eat except a few roots of water plants but he was accustomed to privation and these kept him alive often he heard the hounds baying on the dry land adjoining the marsh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
19,441-128982-0019,and sometimes he saw at night distant torches which he was sure were carried by men who were hunting for him but at last the pursuit seemed to be given up and hearing no more dogs and seeing no more flickering lights bartholemy left the marsh and set out on his long journey down the coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
20,441-128982-0020,which was forty leagues away but where he had reason to suppose he would find some friends when he came out from among the trees he mounted a small hill and looked back upon the town the public square was lighted and there in the middle of it he saw the gallows which had been erected for his execution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
21,441-128982-0021,and this sight doubtless animated him very much during the first part of his journey the terrible trials and hardships which bartholemy experienced during his tramp along the coast were such as could have been endured only by one of the strongest and toughest of men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
22,441-128982-0022,but after a diet of roots shellfish must have been a very agreeable change and they gave him all the strength and vigor he needed very often he found streams and inlets which he was obliged to ford,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
23,441-128982-0023,when he had made for himself what seemed to be a free passage he would dash in and hurry across at other times great forests stretched down to the very coast and through these he was obliged to make his way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
24,441-128982-0024,although he could hear the roars and screams of wild beasts all about him any one who is afraid to go down into a dark cellar to get some apples from a barrel at the foot of the stairs can have no idea of the sort of mind possessed by bartholemy portuguez,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
25,441-128982-0025,the animals might howl around him and glare at him with their shining eyes and the alligators might lash the water into foam with their great tails,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
26,441-128982-0026,this was a wide river flowing through the inland country into the sea he made his way up the shore of this river for a considerable distance but it grew but little narrower and he could see no chance of getting across he could not swim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
27,441-128982-0027,and he had no wine jars now with which to buoy himself up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
28,441-128982-0028,but a man in his situation would not be likely to give up readily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
29,441-128982-0029,now a piece of good fortune happened to him although to an ordinary traveller it might have been considered a matter of no importance whatever on the edge of the shore where it had floated down from some region higher up the river,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
30,441-128982-0030,bartholemy perceived an old board in which there were some long and heavy rusty nails greatly encouraged by this discovery the indefatigable traveller set about a work which resembled that of the old woman who wanted a needle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
31,441-128982-0031,and who began to rub a crow bar on a stone in order to reduce it to the proper size bartholemy carefully knocked all the nails out of the board and then finding a large flat stone he rubbed down one of them until he had formed it into the shape of a rude knife blade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
32,441-128982-0032,which he made as sharp as he could then with these tools he undertook the construction of a raft working away like a beaver and using the sharpened nails instead of his teeth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
33,441-128982-0033,he cut down a number of small trees and when he had enough of these slender trunks he bound them together with reeds and osiers which he found on the river bank so after infinite labor and trial he constructed a raft which would bear him on the surface of the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
34,441-128982-0034,gathering up his legs so as to keep out of reach of the alligators and with a long pole pushed himself off from shore sometimes paddling and sometimes pushing his pole against the bottom he at last got across the river and took up his journey upon dry land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
35,441-128982-0035,even if he could not walk no athlete of the present day no matter if he should be a most accomplished circus man could reasonably expect to perform the feat which this bold pirate successfully accomplished for five or six leagues he went through that mangrove forest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
36,441-128982-0036,never once setting his foot upon the ground by which is meant mud water and roots but swinging himself by his hands and arms from branch to branch as if he had been a great ape only resting occasionally drawing himself upon a stout limb where he might sit for a while and get his breath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
37,441-130108-0000,a sputtering of musketry was always to be heard later the cannon had entered the dispute in the fog filled air their voices made a thudding sound the reverberations were continual,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
38,441-130108-0001,this part of the world led a strange battleful existence the youth's regiment was marched to relieve a command that had lain long in some damp trenches the men took positions behind a curving line of rifle pits that had been turned up like a large furrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
39,441-130108-0002,he could see the low line of trenches but for a short distance a few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
40,441-130108-0003,always the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and left and the din on the right had grown to frightful proportions the guns were roaring without an instant's pause for breath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
41,441-130108-0004,it seemed that the cannon had come from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous wrangle it became impossible to make a sentence heard the youth wished to launch a joke a quotation from newspapers he desired to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
42,441-130108-0005,all quiet on the rappahannock but the guns refused to permit even a comment upon their uproar he never successfully concluded the sentence but at last the guns stopped and among the men in the rifle pits rumors again flew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
43,441-130108-0006,like birds but they were now for the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope the men's faces grew doleful from the interpreting of omens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
44,441-130108-0007,stories of disaster were borne into their minds with many proofs this din of musketry on the right growing like a released genie of sound expressed and emphasized the army's plight the men were disheartened and began to mutter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
45,441-130108-0008,and it could always be seen that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could not fully comprehend a defeat before the gray mists had been totally obliterated by the sun rays the regiment was marching in a spread column that was retiring carefully through the woods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
46,441-130108-0009,the disordered hurrying lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields they were yelling shrill and exultant at this sight the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged he exploded in loud sentences,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
47,441-130108-0010,observed a man his friend recently aroused was still very drowsy he looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement then he sighed oh well i s'pose we got licked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
48,441-130108-0011,he remarked sadly the youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men he made an attempt to restrain himself but the words upon his tongue were too bitter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
49,441-130108-0012,he presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the commander of the forces mebbe it wa'n't all his fault not all together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
50,441-130108-0013,it's our luck t git licked often said his friend in a weary tone he was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been caned and kicked well don't we fight like the devil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
51,441-130108-0014,don't we do all that men can demanded the youth loudly he was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment when it came from his lips for a moment his face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
52,441-130108-0015,but no one questioned his right to deal in such words and presently he recovered his air of courage he went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning the brigadier said he never saw a new reg'ment fight the way we fought yestirday didn't he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
53,441-130108-0016,in his reply the friend's voice was stern a course not he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
54,441-130108-0017,but still still we don't have no luck well then if we fight like the devil an don't ever whip it must be the general's fault said the youth grandly and decisively,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
55,441-130108-0018,and i don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting yet always losing through some derned old lunkhead of a general,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
56,441-130108-0019,the speech pierced the youth inwardly he was reduced to an abject pulp by these chance words his legs quaked privately he cast a frightened glance at the sarcastic man why no he hastened to say in a conciliating voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
57,441-130108-0020,i don't think i fought the whole battle yesterday but the other seemed innocent of any deeper meaning apparently he had no information it was merely his habit oh he replied in the same tone of calm derision,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
58,441-130108-0021,the youth nevertheless felt a threat his mind shrank from going near to the danger and thereafter he was silent the significance of the sarcastic man's words took from him all loud moods that would make him appear prominent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
59,441-130108-0022,he became suddenly a modest person there was low toned talk among the troops the officers were impatient and snappy their countenances clouded with the tales of misfortune,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
60,441-130108-0023,the troops sifting through the forest were sullen in the youth's company once a man's laugh rang out a dozen soldiers turned their faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
61,441-130108-0024,the noise of firing dogged their footsteps sometimes it seemed to be driven a little way but it always returned again with increased insolence the men muttered and cursed throwing black looks in its direction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
62,441-130108-0025,in a clear space the troops were at last halted regiments and brigades broken and detached through their encounters with thickets grew together again and lines were faced toward the pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
63,441-130108-0026,increased to a loud and joyous burst and then as the sun went serenely up the sky throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets it broke forth into prolonged pealings the woods began to crackle as if afire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
64,441-130108-0027,said a man here we are everybody fightin blood an destruction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
65,441-130108-0028,who were lying down behind whatever protection they had collected a battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance the regiment unmolested as yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
66,441-130108-0029,awaited the moment when the gray shadows of the woods before them should be slashed by the lines of flame there was much growling and swearing good gawd the youth grumbled we're always being chased around like rats it makes me sick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
67,441-130108-0030,nobody seems to know where we go or why we go we just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here and get licked there and nobody knows what it's done for it makes a man feel like a damn kitten in a bag,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
68,441-130108-0031,now i'd like to know what the eternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow unless it was to give the rebs a regular pot shot at us we came in here and got our legs all tangled up in these cussed briers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
69,441-130108-0032,and then we begin to fight and the rebs had an easy time of it don't tell me it's just luck i know better it's this derned old the friend seemed jaded but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of calm confidence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

71,441-130108-0034,at this time there was an interposition by the savage minded lieutenant who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his men you boys shut right up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

73,441-130108-0036,less talkin an more fightin is what's best for you boys i never saw sech gabbling jackasses he paused ready to pounce upon any man who might have the temerity to reply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
74,441-130108-0037,the day had grown more white until the sun shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest a sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward that part of the line where lay the youth's regiment the front shifted a trifle to meet it squarely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
75,441-130108-0038,there was a wait in this part of the field there passed slowly the intense moments that precede the tempest a single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment in an instant it was joined by many others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
76,441-130108-0039,there was a mighty song of clashes and crashes that went sweeping through the woods the guns in the rear aroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burr like at them suddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band of guns,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
77,441-130108-0040,the battle roar settled to a rolling thunder which was a single long explosion in the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
78,441-130108-0041,they were worn exhausted having slept but little and labored much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
79,441-128988-0000,chapter thirteen a resurrected pirate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
80,441-128988-0001,that he had come back a comparative pauper surprised no one for this was a common thing to happen to a pirate but the wonder was that he got back at all he had no money but by the exercise of his crafty abilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
81,441-128988-0002,he managed to get possession of a ship which he manned with a crew of about a score of impecunious dare devils who were very anxious to do something to mend their fortunes having now become very fond of land fighting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
82,441-128988-0003,he did not go out in search of ships but directed his vessel to a little village called de los cayos on the coast of cuba for here he thought was a chance for a good and easy stroke of business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
83,441-128988-0004,so that large ships could not approach very near and thus the villagers were kept busy carrying goods and supplies in small boats backwards and forwards from the town to the vessels at anchor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
84,441-128988-0005,here was a nice little prize that could not get away from him and l'olonnois had plenty of time to make his preparations to seize it as he could not sail a ship directly up to the town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
85,441-128988-0006,he cruised about the coast at some distance from de los cayos endeavoring to procure two small boats in which to approach the town but although his preparations were made as quietly as possible the presence of his vessel was discovered by some fishermen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
86,441-128988-0007,informing the governor of the island that the cruel pirate l'olonnois was in a ship a short distance from their village which he undoubtedly intended to attack when the governor heard this astonishing tale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
87,441-128988-0008,it was almost impossible for him to believe it the good news of the death of l'olonnois had come from campeachy to havana and the people of the latter town also rejoiced greatly to be now told that this scourge of the west indies was alive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
88,441-128988-0009,and was about to fall upon a peaceful little village on the island over which he ruled filled the governor with rage as well as amazement and he ordered a well armed ship with a large crew of fighting men to sail immediately for de los cayos,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
89,441-128988-0010,by the time the war vessel had arrived at de los cayos l'olonnois had made his preparation to attack the place he had procured two large canoes and in these he had intended to row up to the town and land with his men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
90,441-128988-0011,but now there was a change in the state of affairs and he was obliged to alter his plans the ordinary person in command of two small boats who should suddenly discover that a village which he supposed almost defenceless was protected by a large man of war,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
91,441-128988-0012,with cannon and a well armed crew would have altered his plans so completely that he would have left that part of the coast of cuba with all possible expedition but the pirates of that day seemed to pay very little attention to the element of odds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
92,441-128988-0013,if they met an enemy who was weak they would fall upon him and if they met with one who was a good deal stronger than themselves they would fall upon him all the same when the time came to fight they fought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
93,441-128988-0014,but no intention of giving up his project entered his mind as the spanish vessel was in his way he would attack her and get her out of his way if the thing could be done in this new state of affairs he was obliged to use stratagem,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
94,441-128988-0015,and he also needed a larger force than he had with him and he therefore captured some men who were fishing along the coast and put them into his canoes to help work the oars then by night he proceeded slowly in the direction of the spanish vessel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
95,441-128988-0016,the man of war was anchored not very far from the town and when about two o'clock in the morning the watch on deck saw some canoes approaching they supposed them to be boats from shore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
96,441-128988-0017,for as has been said such vessels were continually plying about those shallow waters the canoes were hailed and after having given an account of themselves they were asked if they knew anything about the pirate ship upon the coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
97,441-128988-0018,but their way was a very different one from any which could have been expected by the captain of the ship they rowed off into the darkness instead of going toward the town and waited until nearly daybreak then they boldly made for the man of war,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
98,441-128988-0019,one canoe attacking her on one side and the other on the other before the spanish could comprehend what had happened there were more than twenty pirates upon their decks the dreaded l'olonnois at their head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
99,441-128988-0020,and they fought each scoundrel of them like three men and the savage fight ended by every spanish sailor or officer who was not killed or wounded being forced to stay below decks where the hatches were securely fastened down upon them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
100,441-128988-0021,l'olonnois now stood a proud victor on the deck of his prize and being a man of principle he determined to live up to the distinguished reputation which he had acquired in that part of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
101,441-128988-0022,baring his muscular and hairy right arm he clutched the handle of his sharp and heavy cutlass and ordered the prisoners to be brought up from below one at a time and conducted to the place where he stood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
102,441-128988-0023,he wished to give spain a lesson which would make her understand that he was not to be interfered with in the execution of his enterprises and he determined to allow himself the pleasure of personally teaching this lesson,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
103,441-128988-0024,this man who was not a soldier was desperately frightened and begged piteously for his life l'olonnois finding that the man was willing to tell everything he knew questioned him about the sending of this vessel from havana,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
104,441-128988-0025,and when the poor fellow had finished by telling that he had come there not of his own accord but simply for the purpose of obeying his master to hang all the pirates except their leader that great buccaneer laughed and finding he could get nothing more from the negro,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
105,441-128988-0026,cut off his head likewise and his body was tumbled into the sea after those of his companions now there was not a spaniard left on board the great ship except one man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
106,441-128988-0027,who had been preserved from the fate of the others because l'olonnois had some correspondence to attend to and he needed a messenger to carry a letter the pirate captain went into the cabin where he found writing materials ready to his hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
107,441-128988-0028,and there he composed a letter to the governor of havana a part of which read as follows i shall never henceforward give quarter unto any spaniard whatsoever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
108,441-128988-0029,when this message was received by the dignified official who filled the post of governor of cuba he stormed and fairly foamed at the mouth to be utterly foiled and discomfited by this resurrected pirate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
109,441-128988-0030,and to be afterwards addressed in terms of such unheard of insolence and abuse was more than he could bear and in the presence of many of his officials and attendants he swore a terrible oath that after that hour he would never again give quarter to any buccaneer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
110,441-128988-0031,but when the inhabitants of havana and the surrounding villages heard of this terrible resolution of their governor they were very much disturbed they lived in constant danger of attack especially those who were engaged in fishing or maritime pursuits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
111,441-128988-0032,and they feared that when it became known that no buccaneer was to receive quarter the spanish colonists would be treated in the same way no matter where they might be found and taken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
112,441-128988-0033,consequently it was represented to the governor that his plan of vengeance would work most disastrously for the spanish settlers for the buccaneers could do far more damage to them than he could possibly do to these dreadful brethren of the coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
113,441-128988-0034,and that unless he wished to bring upon them troubles greater than those of famine or pestilence they begged that he would retract his oath when the high dignitary had cooled down a little he saw that there was a good deal of sense in what the representative of the people had said to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
114,441-128988-0035,and he also discovered much to his surprise that there were very few provisions on board for when the vessel was sent from havana it was supposed she would make but a very short cruise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
115,1447-130552-0000,laid down in a most unflinching and vigorous fashion lamentable instances of extravagance lash themselves into fury,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

212,1447-17506-0003,a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

217,1447-17506-0008,count ferralti found a place beside louise but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment the dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

219,1447-17506-0010,afterward uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of red hot scoria toward the sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

221,1447-17506-0012,and beth replied that his manners were so like those of their cousin louise that the two ought to get along nicely together uncle john liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men generally to meet them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
222,1447-17506-0013,but there was something in the appearance of this callow italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
223,1447-17506-0014,to establish friendly relations with his girls next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel was a brother of that floriano who managed the hotel du vesuve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
224,1447-17506-0015,that gave him an excuse to talk with the man who spoke very good english and was exceedingly courteous to his guests especially when they were american,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

226,1447-17506-0017,he turned to his list of guests who register by card and not in a book and continued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

228,1447-17506-0019,then he remarked that the eruption of vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
229,1447-17506-0020,that i cannot tell you signor merrick oh perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country i i know little of the nobility answered floriano indignantly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

231,1447-17506-0022,observe signor here is our record of nobility it is the same as the blue book or the peerage of england either fortunately or unfortunately i cannot say you have no need of such a book in america,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

233,1447-17506-0024,and no such noble family signor merrick uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow i misunderstood your name last evening he said i thought you were count ferralti,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
234,1447-17506-0025,and that is right sir was the prompt reply allow me to offer you my card uncle john took the card and read conte leonardi ferralti milano italia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
235,1447-17506-0026,he carefully placed the card in his pocket book thank you said he it's a fine morning count charming mister merrick uncle john walked away he was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
236,1447-17506-0027,when an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous he joined his nieces who were all busily engaged in writing letters home and remarked casually you've been deceived in your italian friend louise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
237,1447-17506-0028,he is neither a count nor of noble family although i suppose when you met him in new york he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat the girl paused examining the point of her pen thoughtfully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
238,1447-17506-0029,has never before heard of him how singular exclaimed louise i wonder why he has tried to deceive us oh the world is full of impostors but when you are on to their game they are quite harmless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
239,1447-17506-0030,uncle john hardly knew what to say further he felt he was in an awkward position for louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

241,1447-17506-0032,she would not be likely to care much for this italian fellow and missus merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughter's mind from dwelling on her entanglement oh well my dear he said to her you must act as you see fit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
242,1447-17506-0033,i do not imagine we shall see much of this young man in any event and now that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colors you will know how to handle him better than i can advise you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

245,5561-41615-0001,the majority however appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard one group standing near one of the windows of which eleanor was the center laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
246,5561-41615-0002,and as the morning advanced they became fully aware that something unusual was in the wind several times they caught sight of a folded paper being stealthily passed from one desk to another but as to its contents they had no idea as it was not handed to any one of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
247,5561-41615-0003,at recess there was more grouping and whispering and grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

254,5561-41615-0010,we don't want you to tell if it doesn't concern us we don't care do we girls no indeed was the reply just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
255,5561-41615-0011,on wednesday aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall it was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when miss thompson walked into the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

257,5561-41615-0013,and then she looked toward grace whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention i don't believe grace is guilty at any rate thought miss thompson then she addressed the assembled girls something has come to my ears girls said the principal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
258,5561-41615-0014,that i find hard to credit but before you leave here this afternoon i must know who is innocent and who is guilty miss thompson paused and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats while a few glanced quickly toward eleanor who was looking straight ahead the picture of innocence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
259,5561-41615-0015,that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus matinee or any public performance of this nature i have so severely disciplined pupils for this offence that for a long time no one has disobeyed me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
260,5561-41615-0016,i was therefore astonished to learn that a number of girls regardless of rules have taken matters into their own hands and have decided to absent themselves from school to morrow in order to attend the matinee to be given in the theatre,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
261,5561-41615-0017,such a decision is worse than disobedience it is lawlessness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
262,5561-41615-0018,the standard of the school will be lowered therefore i intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous influence prompted this act of insubordination report says that this movement originated in the junior class,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
263,5561-41615-0019,and that a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils who pledged themselves to play truant and attend the matinee to morrow the eyes of grace and her chums turned questioningly toward mabel allison who nodded slightly in the affirmative so that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
264,5561-41615-0020,grace inwardly congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing none of her friends were implicated either even mabel had refused to sign,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
265,5561-41615-0021,what i insist upon knowing now is who are the real culprits beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
266,5561-41615-0022,her example was followed until two thirds of the girls present were standing the principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly discomfitting that will do she said curtly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
267,5561-41615-0023,after they had stood for what seemed to them an age but was really only a couple of minutes you may be seated the girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself without hesitating eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an insolent smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
268,5561-41615-0024,i wrote it miss thompson she said clearly i wrote it because i wished to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
269,5561-41615-0025,because it has spoiled all our fun there was a gasp of horror at eleanor's assertion no one had ever before spoken so disrespectfully to their revered principal miss savell said the principal quietly although her flashing eyes and set lips showed that she was very angry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
270,5561-41615-0026,if you have that paper in your possession bring it to me at once and never answer me again as you did just now you are both disrespectful and impertinent but miss thompson's anger toward eleanor was nothing compared with the tempest that the principal had aroused in eleanor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
271,5561-41615-0027,the latter flushed then turned perfectly white with rage still standing she reached down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
272,5561-41615-0028,words cannot express my contempt for them and right here i accuse grace harlowe and her sorority of getting the information from mabel allison yesterday and carrying it to you they are all tale bearers and sneaks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
273,5561-41615-0029,with these words eleanor angrily flung the book she held on the desk and walked down the aisle toward the door but miss thompson barred her way stop miss savell she commanded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
274,5561-41615-0030,i will not tolerate such behavior eleanor glared at the principal whose face was rigid in its purpose then sank into the nearest vacant seat saying defiantly you may keep me here all night if you like,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
275,5561-41615-0031,nevertheless she did not again attempt to leave the room she had met with a will stronger than her own and she realized it ignoring eleanor's final remark miss thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
276,5561-41615-0032,those girls who are not in any way implicated in this matter are dismissed she said about one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall the phi sigma tau being among the number,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
277,5561-41615-0033,grace motioned the girls to hurry she wished to leave the room with her friends before miss thompson noticed them she knew the principal would insist on an apology from eleanor and neither she nor her friends wished it for the first time since eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
278,5561-41615-0034,grace was thoroughly angry with her she could not forgive eleanor for having accused her and her friends of carrying tales before almost the entire school therefore a forced apology would not appease her wounded pride,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
279,5561-41615-0035,she drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door hurry up she said we'll talk when we get outside school don't stop for a minute if miss thompson notices that we are gone she'll send after us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
280,5561-41615-0036,the girls silently donned their wraps and fled from the building like fugitives from justice once on the street a lively confab ensued all talking at once let's take turns talking cried grace laughing we shall understand each other a little better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
281,5561-41615-0037,she has certainly shown her true colors this time i never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her old plan said marian barber it was abominable said eva allen the other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
282,5561-41615-0038,i suppose it did look as though i told you girls said mabel allison who had joined them at the gate you know i was with you at recess right after the paper had been passed to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
283,5561-41615-0039,it was passed to me by mistake very likely agreed grace i wonder who did tell miss thompson i saw several girls with the paper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
284,5561-41615-0040,there will be weeping and wailing in the skull and crossbones crowd exclaimed nora they are all in this mix up and if they aren't suspended they'll be lucky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
285,5561-41615-0041,no said grace shortly she deserves to be punished the things she said to miss thompson were disgraceful and i shall never forgive her for the way she spoke of us i wouldn't say that grace remarked anne you can never tell what may happen to change your views,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
286,5561-41615-0042,it will have to be something remarkable in this instance replied grace grimly as she bade the girls good bye remember girls basketball practice again to morrow and the rest of the week miss thompson has promised me the gymnasium please make it a point to be on hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
287,5561-41615-0043,good bye grace chorused her friends and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of the would be truants to return to those youthful transgressors they were spending a most uncomfortable half hour with miss thompson she was merciless in her denunciation of their conduct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
288,5561-41615-0044,and the terror of suspension arose in more than one mind as they listened to her scathing remarks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
289,5561-41615-0045,but there was nothing funny about it now when with the exception of eleanor the principal dismissed them they filed decorously out very uneasy in mind miss thompson had taken their names but had not stated their punishment and it was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
290,5561-41615-0046,when the last girl had disappeared the principal turned to eleanor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

302,5561-39621-0009,cries arose in the distance a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city and the first distinct sound that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

310,5561-39621-0017,when the king passed before him the unknown who had leant forward over the balcony to obtain a better view and who had concealed his face by leaning on his arm felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter jealousy the noise of the trumpets excited him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

314,5561-39621-0021,cropole was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks without observing that an old man on foot but leading a small irish horse by the bridle was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the entrance to the medici but at that moment the voice of the stranger was heard from the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

342,5561-41616-0003,their penalty was far from light but they had not been suspended and so they resolved to endure it as best they might grace harlowe felt a load lifted from her mind when miss thompson publicly announced that she had not received any information from either mabel allison or the phi sigma tau,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

351,5561-41616-0012,she felt a personal grudge against eleanor for her accusation against mabel who had grown very dear to her and whom she mothered like a hen with one chicken she'll probably appear at the game in all her glory said miriam nesbit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
352,5561-41616-0013,the recess bell cut short the conversation and the girls returned to their desks with far better ideas of the coming game than of the afternoon's lessons saturday december twelfth dawned cold and clear and the girls on both teams were in high spirits as they hustled into their respective locker rooms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
353,5561-41616-0014,and rapidly donned their gymnasium suits the spectators had not yet begun to arrive as it was still early so the girls indulged in a little warming up practice did a few stunts and skipped about overflowing with animal spirits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

356,5561-41616-0017,a tall junior who stood up and beat time with both hands anne had composed the song the week before the juniors had all received copies of the words and had learned them by heart they now sang with the utmost glee and came out particularly strong on the chorus which ran,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

358,5561-41616-0019,shouting the war cry of the juniors there was a great clapping of hands from the admirers of the juniors at this effort but the seniors promptly responded from the other end of the gallery to the tune of dixie with the seniors are the real thing hurrah hurrah our gallant team now takes its stand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
359,5561-41616-0020,and all the baskets soon will land we shout we sing the praises of the seniors hardly had the last notes died away when the referee blew the whistle and the teams hustled to their positions grace and julia crosby faced each other beamed amiably and shook hands,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

361,5561-41616-0022,and sent it flying toward miriam who was so carefully guarded that she dared not attempt to make the basket and after a feint managed to throw it to nora who tried for the basket at long range and missed there was a general scramble for the ball and for five minutes neither team scored,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
362,5561-41616-0023,then marian barber dropped a neat field goal and soon after grace scored on a foul the junior fans howled joyfully at the good work of their team the seniors did not intend to allow them to score again in a hurry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
363,5561-41616-0024,they played such a close guarding game that try as they might the juniors made no headway then julia crosby scored on a field goal making the score three to two this spurred the junior team on to greater effort and miriam made a brilliant throw to basket that brought forth an ovation from the gallery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
364,5561-41616-0025,this ended the first half with the score five to two in favor of the juniors they'll have to work to catch up with us now said nora o'malley triumphantly to the members of the team who sat resting in the little side room off the gymnasium we have the lead but we can't afford to boast yet replied grace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

368,5561-41616-0029,then the seniors scored twice on fouls tying the score the juniors set their teeth and waded in with all their might and main setting a whirlwind pace that caused their fans to shout with wild enthusiasm and fairly dazed their opponents grace alone netted four foul goals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
369,5561-41616-0030,and the sensational playing of nora and miriam was a matter of wonder to the spectators who conceded it to be the fastest most brilliant half ever played by an oakdale team,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

537,4195-17507-0041,as if they had never known a moment's fear in their lives so the girls and their uncle climbed into the vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with his usual vigor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

548,4195-186238-0003,another hour was spent in looking in at the shop windows then suddenly noting the time uncle john started down the street at a swinging pace and presently paused before a building upon which was a sign reading isham,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

555,4195-186238-0010,uncle john had been advised by patsy where to go for a good cheap luncheon but he did not heed her admonition instead he rode in a carriage beside the banker to a splendid club where he was served with the finest dishes the chef could provide on short notice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

559,4195-186238-0014,in a moment the great broadway crowd had swallowed up john merrick and five minutes later he was thoughtfully gazing into a shop window again by and bye he bethought himself of the time and took a cab uptown,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

572,4195-186238-0027,and we sleep till eight o'clock don't we patsy asked the major of course and the eggs for breakfast i've bought them already three for a nickle you don't care for more than one do you uncle john no my dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
573,4195-186236-0000,chapter twenty three patsy adopts an uncle uncle john and mister watson did not appear at dinner being closeted in the former's room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
574,4195-186236-0001,being served by the old servants as a mere matter of routine indeed the arrangements of the household had been considerably changed by the death of its mistress and without any real head to direct them the servants were patiently awaiting the advent of a new master or mistress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
575,4195-186236-0002,but there were few tears shed for jane merrick and the new regime could not fail to be an improvement over the last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
576,4195-186236-0003,but being unaware of its import gave it but passing attention the main subject of conversation was aunt jane's surprising act in annulling her last will and forcing patricia to accept the inheritance when she did not want it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
577,4195-186236-0004,when alone with the three cousins protested that it would not be right for patsy to give him all the estate but as she was so generous he would accept enough of his uncle tom's money to educate him as an artist and provide for himself an humble home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
578,4195-186236-0005,louise and beth having at last full knowledge of their cousin's desire to increase their bequests were openly very grateful for her good will although secretly they could not fail to resent patsy's choice of the boy as the proper heir of his uncle's fortune,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
579,4195-186236-0006,the balance of power seemed to be in patricia's hands however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
580,4195-186236-0007,to offend her altogether they were all better provided for than they had feared would be the case so the little party spent a pleasant evening and separated early beth and louise to go to their rooms and canvass quietly the events of the day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
581,4195-186236-0008,and then she went to bed and slept peacefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
582,4195-186236-0009,lawyer watson and uncle john were there looking as grave as the important occasion demanded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
583,4195-186236-0010,and the subsequent finding of the will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
584,4195-186236-0011,was made subsequent to the one under which jane merrick inherited and therefore supercedes it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

586,4195-186236-0013,mister bradley having provided for that most fully for this reason the will i read to you yesterday is of no effect and kenneth forbes inherits from his uncle through his mother all of the estate blank looks followed mister watson's statement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
587,4195-186236-0014,good by to my five thousand said uncle john with his chuckling laugh but i'm much obliged to jane nevertheless don't we get anything at all asked beth with quivering lip no my dear answered the lawyer gently your aunt owned nothing to give you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
588,4195-186236-0015,patsy laughed she felt wonderfully relieved wasn't i the grand lady though with all the fortune i never had she cried merrily but twas really fine to be rich for a day and toss the money around as if i didn't have to dress ten heads of hair in ten hours to earn my bread and butter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
589,4195-186236-0016,louise smiled it was all a great farce she said i shall take the afternoon train to the city what an old fraud our dear aunt jane was and how foolish of me to return her hundred dollar check i used mine said beth bitterly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
590,4195-186236-0017,it's all i'll ever get it seems and then the thought of the professor and his debts overcame her and she burst into tears the boy sat doubled within his chair so overcome by the extraordinary fortune that had overtaken him that he could not speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
591,4195-186236-0018,nor think even clearly as yet patsy tried to comfort beth never mind dear said she we're no worse off than before we came are we and we've had a nice vacation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
592,4195-186236-0019,i'm going home today said beth angrily drying her eyes we'll all go home said patsy cheerfully for my part remarked uncle john in a grave voice i have no home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
593,4195-186236-0020,i'm wondering that myself said the little man meekly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

595,4195-186236-0022,louise smiled rather scornfully and beth scowled my mother and i live so simply in our little flat said one that we really haven't extra room to keep a cat but we shall be glad to assist uncle john as far as we are able,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
596,4195-186236-0023,father can hardly support his own family said the other but i will talk to my mother about uncle john when i get home and see what she says oh you don't need to indeed cried patsy in great indignation uncle john is my dear mother's brother and he's to come and live with the major and me as long as he cares to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

599,4195-186236-0026,and he said he hoped to see all the girls again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
600,4195-186236-0027,the lawyer who had consented to stay at the mansion for a time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
601,4195-186236-0028,that may be answered the boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
602,4195-186237-0000,chapter twenty four home again the major was at the station to meet them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
603,4195-186237-0001,the girl caught sight of him outside the gates his face red and beaming as a poppy in bloom and his snowy moustache bristling with eagerness at once she dropped her bundles and flew to the major's arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
604,4195-186237-0002,leaving the little man in her wake to rescue her belongings and follow after he could hardly see patsy at all the major wrapped her in such an ample embrace but bye and bye she escaped to get her breath and then her eyes fell upon the meek form holding her bundles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
605,4195-186237-0003,on which account said the major grasping the little man's hand most cordially i'll love uncle john like my own brother and surely he added his voice falling tenderly my dear violet's brother must be my own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
606,4195-186237-0004,welcome sir now and always to our little home it's modest sir but wherever patsy is the sun is sure to shine i can believe that said uncle john with a nod and smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
607,4195-186237-0005,and the old fellow rattled away with the eagerness of a boy telling every detail in the most whimsical manner and finding something humorous in every incident oh but it was grand patsy he exclaimed and the colonel wept on my neck when we parted and stained the collar of me best coat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
608,4195-186237-0006,his face grew grave but how about the money patsy dear he asked did you get nothing out of jane merrick's estate not a nickle dad twas the best joke you ever knew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
609,4195-186237-0007,i fought with aunt jane like a pirate and it quite won her heart when she died she left me all she had in the world look at that now said the major wonderingly which turned out to be nothing at all continued patsy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
610,4195-186237-0008,for another will was found made by mister thomas bradley which gave the money to his own nephew after aunt jane died did you ever wonderful said the major with a sigh so i was rich for half a day and then poor as ever it didn't hurt you did it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
611,4195-186237-0009,not at all daddy then don't mind it child like as not the money would be the ruination of us all eh sir appealing to uncle john,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
612,4195-186237-0010,in your case it won't matter our house is yours and there's plenty and to spare thank you said uncle john his face grave but his eyes merry oh major cried patsy suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
613,4195-186237-0011,there's danny reeves's restaurant let's get off and have our dinner now i'm as hungry as a bear so they stopped the car and descended lugging all the parcels into the little restaurant where they were piled into a chair while the proprietor and the waiters all gathered around patsy to welcome her home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
614,4195-186237-0012,my how her eyes sparkled she fairly danced for joy and ordered the dinner with reckless disregard of the bill ah but it's good to be back said the little bohemian gleefully the big house at elmhurst was grand and stately major but there wasn't an ounce of love in the cupboard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
615,4195-186237-0013,danny reeves himself came instead and made a nice little speech saying that patsy had always brought good luck to the place and this dinner was his treat to welcome her home so the major thanked him with gracious dignity and patsy kissed danny on his right cheek,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
616,4195-186237-0014,it's no palace said patsy entering to throw down the bundles as soon as the major unlocked the door but there's a cricket in the hearth and it's your home uncle john as well as ours uncle john looked around curiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
617,4195-186237-0015,the place was so plain after the comparative luxury of elmhurst and especially of the rose chamber patsy had occupied that the old man could not fail to marvel at the girl's ecstatic joy to find herself in the old tenement again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
618,4195-186237-0016,there was one good sized living room with an ancient rag carpet partially covering the floor a sheet iron stove a sofa a table and three or four old fashioned chairs that had probably come from a second hand dealer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
619,4195-186237-0017,opening from this were two closet like rooms containing each a bed and a chair with a wash basin on a bracket shelf on the wails were a few colored prints from the sunday newspapers and one large and fine photograph of a grizzled old soldier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
620,4195-186237-0018,that uncle john at once decided must represent the colonel having noted these details patsy's uncle smoothed back his stubby gray hair with a reflective and half puzzled gesture it's cozy enough my child and i thank you for my welcome said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
621,4195-186237-0019,but may i enquire where on earth you expect to stow me in this rather limited establishment where have you no eyes then she asked in astonishment it's the finest sofa in the world uncle john and you'll sleep there like a top,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
622,4195-186237-0020,where indeed ah i see said uncle john and you can wash in my chamber added the major with a grand air and hang your clothes on the spare hooks behind my door i haven't many said uncle john looking thoughtfully at his red bundle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
623,4195-186237-0021,the major coughed and turned the lamp a little higher you'll find the air fine and the neighborhood respectable he said to turn the subject our modest apartments are cool in summer and warm in winter and remarkably reasonable in price,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
624,4195-186237-0022,may i smoke of course but don't spoil the lace curtains dear answered patsy mischievously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
625,4195-186237-0023,but just to keep him out of mischief and busy he can't hang around all day and be happy i suppose i'll look around answered the major briskly as if such a job was the easiest thing in the world to procure and meantime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
626,4195-186237-0024,meantime said uncle john smiling at them i'll look around myself to be sure agreed the major between the two of us and patsy we ought to have no trouble at all there was a moment of thoughtful silence after this and then patsy said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
627,4195-186237-0025,by the bye added the major if you have any money about you which is just possible sir of course you'd better turn it over to patsy to keep and let her make you an allowance that's the way i do it's very satisfactory the major's extravagant exclaimed patsy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
628,4195-186237-0026,and if he has money he wants to treat every man he meets uncle john shook his head reproachfully at the major a very bad habit sir he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
629,4195-186237-0027,but patsy is fast curing me and after all it's a wicked city to be carrying a fat pocketbook around in as i've often observed my pocketbook is not exactly fat remarked uncle john but you've money sir for i marked you squandering it on the train said patsy severely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
630,4195-186237-0028,uncle john laughed and drew his chair up to the table then he emptied his trousers pockets upon the cloth and patsy gravely separated the keys and jackknife from the coins and proceeded to count the money seven dollars and forty two cents she announced any more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
631,4195-186237-0029,uncle john hesitated a moment and then drew from an inner pocket of his coat a thin wallet from this when she had received it from his hand the girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
632,4195-186237-0030,good gracious she cried delightedly all this wealth and you pleading poverty i never said i was a pauper returned uncle john complacently you couldn't and be truthful sir declared the girl why this will last for ages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
633,4195-186237-0031,he smokes observed the major significantly bah a pipe said patsy and bull durham is only five cents a bag and a bag ought to last a week and every saturday night sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
634,4195-186237-0032,thank you patsy said uncle john meekly and gathered up his forty two cents you've now a home and a manager sir with money in the bank of patsy and company limited,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
635,4195-186237-0033,you ought to be very contented sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
636,7511-102420-0000,camp cloudcrest october sixth nineteen fourteen dear missus coney it seems so odd to be writing you and getting no answers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
637,7511-102420-0001,i haven't one thing i told her i owed you more love than i could ever pay in a lifetime and she said writing such long letters is a mighty poor way to show it i have been neglecting you shamefully i think,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
638,7511-102420-0002,one of the main reasons i came on this hunt was to take the trip for you and to tell you things that you would most enjoy so i will spend this snowy day in writing to you on the night of september thirtieth there was the most awful thunderstorm i ever witnessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
639,7511-102420-0003,flash after flash of the most blinding lightning followed by deafening peals of thunder and as it echoed from mountain to mountain the uproar was terrifying i have always loved a storm the beat of hail and rain and the roar of wind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
640,7511-102420-0004,always appeal to me but there was neither wind nor rain just flash and roar before the echo died away among the hills another booming report would seem to shiver the atmosphere and set all our tinware jangling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
641,7511-102420-0005,we are camped so near the great pines that i will confess i was powerfully afraid had the lightning struck one of the big pines there would not have been one of us left i could hear missus o'shaughnessy murmuring her prayers when there was a lull,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
642,7511-102420-0006,we had gone to bed but i couldn't remain there so i sat on the wagon seat with jerrine beside me something struck the guy ropes of the tent and i was so frightened i was too weak to cry out i thought the big tree must have fallen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
643,7511-102420-0007,in the lulls of the storm i could hear the men's voices high and excited they too were up it seemed to me that the storm lasted for hours but at last it moved off up the valley the flashes grew to be a mere glimmer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
644,7511-102420-0008,and the thunder mere rumbling the pines began to moan and soon a little breeze whistled by so we lay down again next morning the horses could not be found the storm had frightened them and they had tried to go home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
645,7511-102420-0009,the men had to find them and as it took most of the day we had to put off our hunt we were up and about next morning in the first faint gray light while the men fed grain to the horses and saddled them we prepared a hasty breakfast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
646,7511-102420-0010,we were off before it was more than light enough for us to see the trail dawn in the mountains how i wish i could describe it to you if i could only make you feel the keen bracing air the exhilarating climb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
647,7511-102420-0011,greenish amber light and a blue gray sky far ahead of us we could see the red rim rock of a mountain above timber line the first rays of the sun turned the jagged peaks into golden points of a crown in oklahoma,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
648,7511-102420-0012,even at this season but here there are no song birds and only the snapping of twigs as our horses climbed the frosty trail broke the silence we had been cautioned not to talk but neither missus o'shaughnessy nor i wanted to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
649,7511-102420-0013,the sun was well up when we reached the little park where we picketed our horses then came a long hard climb it is hard climbing at the best and when there is a big gun to carry it is very hard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
650,7511-102420-0014,then too we had to keep up with the men and we didn't find that easy to do at last we reached the top and sat down on some boulders to rest a few minutes before we started down to the hunting ground which lay in a cuplike valley far below us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
651,7511-102420-0015,we could hear the roar of the gros ventre as it tumbled grumblingly over its rocky bed to our right rose mile after mile of red cliffs as the last of the quaking asp leaves have fallen there were no golden groves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
652,7511-102420-0016,in their places stood silvery patches against the red background of the cliffs high overhead a triangle of wild geese harrowed the blue sky i was plumb out of breath but men who are most gallant elsewhere are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
653,7511-102420-0017,absolutely heartless on a hunt i was scarcely through panting before we began to descend we received instructions as to how we should move so as to keep out of range of each other's guns then mister haynes and myself started one way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
654,7511-102420-0018,and mister struble and missus o'shaughnessy the other we were to meet where the valley terminated in a broad pass we felt sure we could get a chance at what elk there might be in the valley we were following fresh tracks and a little of the hunter's enthusiasm seized me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
655,7511-102420-0019,we had not followed them far when three cows and a spike came running out of the pines a little ahead of us instantly mister haynes's gun flew to his shoulder and a deafening report jarred our ears he ran forward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
656,7511-102420-0020,but i stood still fascinated by what i saw our side of the valley was bounded by a rim of rock over the rim was a sheer wall of rock for two hundred feet to where the gros ventre was angrily roaring below on the other side of the stream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
657,7511-102420-0021,rose the red cliffs with their jagged crags at the report of the gun two huge blocks of stone almost as large as a house detached themselves and fell at the same instant one of the quaking asp groves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
658,7511-102420-0022,began to move slowly i couldn't believe my eyes i shut them a moment but when i looked the grove was moving faster it slid swiftly and i could plainly hear the rattle of stones falling against stones until with a muffled roar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
659,7511-102420-0023,the whole hillside fell into the stream mister haynes came running back what is the matter are you hurt why didn't you shoot he asked i waved my hand weakly toward where the great mound of tangled trees and earth blocked the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
660,7511-102420-0024,not an earthquake you are as white as a ghost come on up here and see my fine elk i sat on a log watching him dress his elk we have found it best not to remove the skin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
661,7511-102420-0025,but the elk have to be quartered so as to load them on to a horse missus o'shaughnessy and mister struble came out of the woods just then they had seen a big bunch of elk headed by a splendid bull but got no shot and the elk went out of the pass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
662,7511-102420-0026,they had heard our shot and came across to see what luck what iver is the matter with ye asked missus o'shaughnessy mister haynes told her they had heard the noise but had thought it thunder mister haynes told me that if i would chirk up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
663,7511-102420-0027,he would give me his elk teeth though i don't admire them they are considered valuable however his elk was a cow and they don't have as nice teeth as do bulls we had lunch and the men covered the elk with pine boughs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
664,7511-102420-0028,to keep the camp robbers from pecking it full of holes next day the men would come with the horses and pack it in to camp we all felt refreshed so we started on the trail of those that got away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
665,7511-102420-0029,for a while walking was easy and we made pretty good time then we had a rocky hill to get over we had to use care when we got into the timber there were marshy places which tried us sorely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
666,7511-102420-0030,and windfall so thick that we could hardly get through we were obliged to pick our way carefully to avoid noise and we were all together not having come to a place where it seemed better to separate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
667,7511-102420-0031,we had about resolved to go to our horses when we heard a volley of shots that is somebody bunch shooting said mister struble they are in brewster lake park by the sound that means that the elk will pass here in a short time and we may get a shot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
668,7511-102420-0032,the elk will be here long before the men since the men have no horses so let's hurry and get placed along the only place they can get out we'll get our limit we hastily secreted ourselves along the narrow gorge through which the elk must pass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
669,7511-102420-0033,we were all on one side and mister haynes said to me rest your gun on that rock and aim at the first rib back of the shoulder if you shoot haphazard you may cripple an elk and let it get away to die in misery so make sure when you fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
670,7511-102420-0034,it didn't seem a minute before we heard the beat of their hoofs and a queer panting noise that i can't describe first came a beautiful thing with his head held high,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
671,7511-102420-0035,his eyes were startled and his shining black mane seemed to bristle i heard the report of guns and he tumbled in a confused heap he tried to rise but others coming leaped over him and knocked him down some more shots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
672,7511-102420-0036,and those behind turned and went back the way they had come mister haynes shouted to me shoot shoot why don't you shoot so i fired my krag but next i found myself picking myself up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
673,7511-102420-0037,and wondering who had struck me and for what i was so dizzy i could scarcely move but i got down to where the others were excitedly admiring the two dead elk that they said were the victims of missus o'shaughnessy's gun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
674,7511-102420-0038,she was as excited and delighted as if she had never declared she would not kill anything sure it's many a meal they'll make for little hungry mouths she said she was rubbing her shoulder ruefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
675,7511-102420-0039,i thought old goliar had hit me a biff with a blackthorn shilaley she remarked mister haynes turned to me and said you are a dandy hunter you didn't shoot at all until after the elk were gone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
676,7511-102420-0040,and the way you held your gun it is a wonder it didn't knock your head off instead of just smashing your jaw the men worked as fast as they could at the elk and we helped as much as we could but it was dark before we reached camp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
677,7511-102420-0041,supper was ready but i went to bed at once they all thought it was because i was so disappointed but it was because i was so stiff and sore i could hardly move and so tired i couldn't sleep next morning my jaw and neck were so swollen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
678,7511-102420-0042,that i hated any one to see me and my head ached for two days it has been snowing for a long time but clyde says he will take me hunting when it stops,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
679,7511-102420-0043,and go back empty handed and partly to get a rest from mister murry's everlasting accordion mister murry is an old time acquaintance of missus o'shaughnessy's he has a ranch down on the river somewhere missus o'shaughnessy has not seen him for years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
680,7511-102420-0044,didn't know he lived up here he had seen the game warden from whom she had procured her license and so hunted up our camp he is an odd looking individual with sad eyes and a drooping mouth which gives his face a most hopeless reproachful expression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
681,7511-102420-0045,his nose however seems to upset the original plan for it is long and thin and bent slightly to one side his neck is long and his adam's apple seems uncertain as to where it belongs at supper jerrine watched it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
682,7511-102420-0046,as if fascinated until i sent her from the table and went out to speak to her about gazing why mamma she said i had to look he has swallowed something that won't go either up or down and i'm fraid he'll choke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
683,7511-102420-0047,although i can't brag about mister murry's appearance i can about his taste for he admires missus o'shaughnessy it seems that in years gone by he has made attempts to marry her as he got up from supper the first night he was with us he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
684,7511-102420-0048,mary ellen i have a real treat and surprise for you just wait a few minutes an i'll bet you'll be happy we took our accustomed places around the fire while mister murry hobbled his cayuse and took an odd looking bundle from his saddle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
685,7511-102420-0049,he seated himself and took from the bundle an accordion he set it upon his knee and began pulling and pushing on it he did what mister struble said was doling a doleful tune every one took it good naturedly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

691,7511-102419-0004,the mountains on one side were crested great crags and piles of rock crowned them as far as we could see timber grew only about halfway up the trunks of the quaking aspens shone silvery in the early sunlight and their leaves were shimmering gold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
692,7511-102419-0005,and the stately pines kept whispering and murmuring it almost seemed as if they were chiding the quaking aspens for being frivolous on the other side of the road lay the river bordered by willows and grassy flats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

699,7511-102419-0012,before i was through school i was to have been married but i lost my mother just then and was left the care of my paralytic father if i had married then i should have had to take father from his familiar surroundings because wallace came west in the forestry service,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
700,7511-102419-0013,i felt that it wouldn't be right poor father couldn't speak but his eyes told me how grateful he was to stay we had our little home and father had his pension and i was able to get a small school near us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
701,7511-102419-0014,i could take care of father and teach also we were very comfortably situated and in time became really happy although i seldom heard from wallace his letters were well worth waiting for and i knew he was doing well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

704,7511-102419-0017,supposin it's married your man is wallace may have changed his mind about me but he would not marry without telling me if he is alive he is honorable then i asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
705,7511-102419-0018,if he is stationed in the bridges reserve they would be sure to know of him at any of these little places i just didn't have the courage to i should never have told you what i have only i think i owe it to you and it was easier because of the holts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
706,7511-102419-0019,i am so glad we met them so we drove along talking together we each assured the girl of our entire willingness to have her as a member of the family after a while i got on to the wagon with mister stewart and told him elizabeth's story,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
707,7511-102419-0020,and we held our breath until we emerged on the other side mister sorenson is a very capable and conscientious game warden and a very genial gentleman he rode down to meet us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
708,7511-102419-0021,to inspect our license and to tell us about our privileges and our duties as good woodsmen he also issues licenses in case hunters have neglected to secure them before coming missus o'shaughnessy had refused to get a license when we did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
709,7511-102419-0022,she said she was not going to hunt she told us we could give her a small piece of ilk and that would do so we were rather surprised when she purchased two licenses one a special which would entitle her to a bull elk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
710,7511-102419-0023,as we were starting mister stewart asked the game warden can you tell me if wallace white is still stationed here oh yes mister sorenson said wallace's place is only a few miles up the river and can be plainly seen from the road we drove on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
711,7511-102419-0024,happiness had taken a new clutch upon my heart i looked back expecting to see elizabeth all smiles but if you will believe me the foolish girl was sobbing as if her heart was broken missus o'shaughnessy drew her head down upon her shoulder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
712,7511-102419-0025,and was trying to quiet her the road along there was very rough staying on the wagon occupied all my attention for a while several miles were passed when we came in sight of a beautiful cabin half hidden in a grove of pines beyond the river,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
713,7511-102419-0026,mister stewart said we might as well noon as soon as we came to a good place and then he would ride across and see mister white just as we rounded the hill a horseman came toward us a splendid fellow he was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
714,7511-102419-0027,manly strength and grace showing in every line the road was narrow against the hillside and he had to ride quite close so i saw his handsome face plainly as soon as he saw elizabeth he sprang from his saddle and said liz'beth liz'beth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
715,7511-102419-0028,she held her hands to him and said oh just riding with friends then to missus o'shaughnessy she said this is my wallace mister stewart is the queerest man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
716,7511-102419-0029,instead of letting me enjoy the tableau he solemnly drove on saying he would not want any one gawking at him if he were the happy man anyway he couldn't urge chub fast enough to prevent my seeing and hearing what i've told you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
717,7511-102419-0030,besides that i saw that elizabeth's hat was on awry her hair in disorder and her eyes red it was disappointing after she had been so careful to look nicely missus o'shaughnessy came trotting along and we stopped for dinner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
718,7511-102419-0031,we had just got the coffee boiling when the lovers came up elizabeth in the saddle learning to ride and he walking beside her holding her hand how happy they were the rest of us were mighty near as foolish as they,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
719,7511-102419-0032,they were going to start immediately after dinner on horseback for the county seat to be married after we had eaten elizabeth selected a few things from her trunk and mister stewart and mister white drove the buckboard across the river to leave the trunk in its new home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
720,7511-102419-0033,while they were gone we helped elizabeth to dress all the while missus o'shaughnessy was admonishing her to name her first girul mary ellen or she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
721,7511-102419-0034,which was me name before i was married to me man god rest his soul dear elizabeth she was glad to get away i suspect she and her wallace made a fine couple as they rode away in the golden september afternoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
722,7511-102419-0035,i believe she is one happy bride that the sun shone on if the omen has failed everywhere else well we felt powerfully reduced in numbers but about three o'clock that afternoon we came upon mister struble and mister haynes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
723,7511-102419-0036,waiting beside the road for us they had come to pilot us into camp for there would be no road soon such a way as we came over such jolting and sliding i begged to get off and walk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
724,7511-102419-0037,but as the whole way was carpeted by strawberry vines and there were late berries to tempt me to loiter i had to stay on the wagon i had no idea a wagon could be got across such places mister struble drove for missus o'shaughnessy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
725,7511-102419-0038,and i could hear her imploring all the saints to preserve us from instant death i kept shutting my eyes trying not to see the terrifying places and opening them again to see the beauty spread everywhere until mister stewart said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
726,7511-102419-0039,it must make you nervous to ride over mountain roads don't bat your eyes so fast and you'll see more so then i stiffened my back and kept my eyes open and i did see more it had been decided to go as far as we could with the wagons and then set camp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
727,7511-102419-0040,from there the hunters would ride horseback as far up as they could and then climb it was almost sundown when we reached camp all the hunters were in and such a yowling as they set up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
728,7511-102419-0041,look who's here see who's come they yelled they went to work setting up tents and unloading wagons with a hearty good will we are camped just on the edge of the pines back of us rises a big pine clad mountain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
729,7511-102419-0042,our tents are set under some big trees on a small plateau and right below us is a valley in which grass grows knee high and little streams come from every way trout scurry up stream whenever we go near,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
730,7511-102419-0043,we call the valley paradise valley because it is the horses paradise and as in the early morning we can often see clouds rolling along the valley we call our camp cloudcrest we have a beautiful place it is well sheltered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
731,7511-102419-0044,there is plenty of wood water and feed and looking eastward down the valley snow covered crag topped mountains delight the eye the air is so bracing that we all feel equal to anything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
732,7511-102419-0045,mister struble has already killed a fine spike elk for camp eating we camped in a bunch and we have camp stoves so that in case of rain or snow we can stay indoors just now we have a huge camp fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
733,7511-102419-0046,around which we sit in the evening telling stories singing and eating nuts of the pinon pine then too the whole country is filled with those tiny little strawberries we have to gather all day to get as much as we can eat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

735,7511-102419-0048,altogether this is one of the most delightful places imaginable the men are not very anxious to begin hunting a little delay means cooler weather for the meat it is cool up here but going back across the desert it will be warm for a while yet still,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
736,7511-102419-0049,when they see elk every day it is a great temptation to try a shot one of the students told me professor glenholdt was here to get the tip end bone of the tail of a brontosaurus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

744,1898-145715-0000,once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage at length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as fairer than a fairy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
745,1898-145715-0001,than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it and either to torment her cruelly or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men the eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge this fairy was named lagree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
746,1898-145715-0002,she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
747,1898-145715-0003,she was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or ill natured tricks of the whole body of fairies with her large experience added to her native spite,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
748,1898-145715-0004,she felt a little reassured and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
749,1898-145715-0005,at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate she then gave two glass bottles into the princess's charge desiring her to take the greatest care of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
750,1898-145715-0006,and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience she vanished leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
751,1898-145715-0007,several years passed during which time the princess grew accustomed to her lonely life obeyed the fairy's orders and by degrees forgot all about the court of the king her father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
752,1898-145715-0008,she noticed that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow she stood still to admire it when to her great surprise she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
753,1898-145715-0009,the voice was that of a young man and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming but this had to be a mere matter of fancy for no one was visible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
754,1898-145715-0010,the beautiful rainbow informed fairer than a fairy that he was young the son of a powerful king and that the fairy lagree who owed his parents a grudge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
755,1898-145715-0011,had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years that she had imprisoned him in the palace where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time but now he owned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
756,1898-145715-0012,he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairer than a fairy he added many other tender speeches to this declaration and the princess to whom such remarks were a new experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
757,1898-145715-0013,could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
758,1898-145715-0014,lagree on her return soon found out the neglect and seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
759,1898-145715-0015,for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out now this locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across and especially enjoyed a chance of catching,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
760,1898-145715-0016,and eating any young girls our heroine obeyed with great sweetness and without having been able to take leave of her lover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
761,1898-145715-0017,as to certain death as she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by and to use it when needed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
762,1898-145715-0018,she took the bird's advice and in due time arrived at the house of locrinos luckily she only found his wife at home who was much struck by the princess's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
763,1898-145715-0019,she readily let fairer than a fairy have the fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
764,1898-145715-0020,convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain and fairer than a fairy carried out his plan daily with entire success every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her window sill and as soon as the sun's rays fell on the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
765,1898-145715-0021,the rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain by this means they were able to meet without losing sight of the fire or of the two bottles in which the old fairy kept her eye and her tooth at night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
766,1898-145715-0022,and for some time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe he had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot but he had no idea where he was to go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
767,1898-145715-0023,the poor young couple were in despair and only parted with the last ray of sunshine and in hopes of meeting next morning alas next day was dark and gloomy and it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
768,1898-145715-0024,fairer than a fairy eagerly ran to the window but in her haste she upset the basin and spilt all the water with which she had carefully filled it overnight no other water was at hand except that in the two bottles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
769,1898-145715-0025,it was the only chance of seeing her lover before they were separated and she did not hesitate to break the bottle and pour their contents into the basin when the rainbow appeared at once their farewells were full of tenderness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
770,1898-145715-0026,the prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations and promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dear fairer than a fairy from her captivity and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
771,1898-145715-0027,the princess on her side vowed to have no other husband and declared herself willing to brave death itself in order to rejoin him they were not allowed much time for their adieus the rainbow vanished and the princess resolved to run all risks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
772,1898-145715-0028,started off at once taking nothing with her but her dog her cat a sprig of myrtle and the stone which the wife of locrinos gave her when lagree became aware of her prisoner's flight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
773,1898-145715-0029,as she did so the sprig of myrtle she carried touched the ground and immediately a green and shady bower sprang up round her in which she hoped to sleep in peace but lagree had not given up her pursuit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
774,1898-145715-0030,and arrived just as fairer than a fairy had fallen fast asleep this time she made sure of catching her victim but the cat spied her out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
775,1898-145715-0031,she flew at lagree's face and tore out her only eye thus delivering the princess for ever from her persecutor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
776,1898-145715-0032,but no sooner had lagree been put to fight than our heroine was overwhelmed with hunger and thirst she felt as though she should certainly expire and it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as far,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
777,1898-145715-0033,which stood at no great distance here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white to match the house which apparently belonged to her and of which she seemed the only inhabitant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
778,1898-145715-0034,she gave her a nut desiring her only to open it in the most urgent need after a long and tiring journey fairer than a fairy was once more received in a house and by a lady exactly like the one she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
779,1898-145715-0035,here again she received a present with the same injunctions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
780,1898-145715-0036,that they wished their houses and garments to be equally alike their occupation consisted in helping those in misfortune and they were as gentle and benevolent as lagree had been cruel and spiteful the third fairy comforted the poor traveller,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
781,1898-145715-0037,begged her not to lose heart and assured her that her troubles should be rewarded she accompanied her advice by the gift of a crystal smelling bottle with strict orders only to open it in case of urgent need,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
782,1898-145715-0038,fairer than a fairy thanked her warmly and resumed her way cheered by pleasant thoughts after a time her road led through a wood full of soft airs and sweet odours and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
783,1898-145715-0039,fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows she had no doubt though really i cannot think why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
784,1898-145715-0040,that the moment had come in which to use the nut which had been given her she opened it and out came a diminutive hall porter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
785,1898-145715-0041,you ever saw the princess climbed up one of the silver chains holding in her hand the little porter who in spite of his minute size opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
786,1898-145715-0042,she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire castle and which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
787,1898-145715-0043,who now saw him for the first time in his real shape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
788,1898-145715-0044,on opening it found that all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof and at once began playing melodiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
789,1898-145715-0045,the prince was not completely roused but he opened his eyes a little and looked all the handsomer impatient at not being recognised fairer than a fairy now drew out her third present and on opening the crystal scent bottle a little syren flew out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
790,1898-145715-0046,at the same moment the walls of the room expanded and opened out revealing a golden throne covered with jewels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

807,1898-145724-0012,with diamond windows he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
808,1898-145724-0013,when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted the prince replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
809,1898-145724-0014,would like to enter her service this flattering speech pleased the dragons and the eldest of them said well you may come with me and i will take you to the mother dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
810,1898-145724-0015,they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls all made of gold and diamonds in the twelfth room they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond throne she was the,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
811,1898-145724-0016,and added to it all she had three heads her appearance was a great shock to the prince and so was her voice which was like the croaking of many ravens she asked him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

814,1898-145724-0019,and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate as he sat thus lost in thought he noticed an eagle flying over his head then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
815,1898-145724-0020,and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him and the king of the eagles sank at his feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
816,1898-145724-0021,the bird said you are looking for the mother dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds i will summon all the eagles of the air together and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you and with these words the king of the eagles flew away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
817,1898-145724-0022,towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them they sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
818,1898-145724-0023,who was full of wonder when she saw him and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
819,1898-145724-0024,she gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
820,1898-145724-0025,here too was the flower queen's beautiful daughter her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world and her complexion was like lilies and roses as the prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
821,1898-145724-0026,the ball came to an end at midnight and early next morning the prince again led the mother dragon's mare out into the meadow but again she vanished before his eyes then he took out his little bell and rang it twice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
822,1898-145724-0027,and again she led him to the ball room the flower queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear if you succeed again to morrow wait for me with the foal in the meadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
823,1898-145724-0028,after the ball we will fly away together on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again but once more she vanished before his eyes then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
824,1898-145724-0029,in a moment the king of the fishes appeared and said to him i know quite well what you want me to do and i will summon all the fishes of the sea together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
825,1898-145724-0030,she said to him you are a brave youth and i will make you my body servant but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
826,1898-145724-0031,the prince begged for a foal of the mare which the mother dragon at once gave him and over and above a cloak made of gold for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
827,1898-145724-0032,the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queen's dwelling but the dragons had noticed their flight and woke their brother out of his year's sleep he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
828,1898-145724-0033,and determined to lay siege to the flower queen's palace but the queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling through which no one could force a way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
829,1898-145724-0034,when the flower queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the prince she said to him i will give my consent to your marriage gladly but my daughter can only stay with you in summer in winter when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
830,1898-145724-0035,she must come and live with me in my palace underground the prince consented to this and led his beautiful bride home where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence the young couple lived happily together till winter came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
831,1898-145724-0036,when the flower queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
832,1898-145724-0037,and lasted till the approach of winter when the flower queen's daughter went back again to her mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
833,1898-145702-0000,one of them said to the others if we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows how shall we set about it the other said do you see that large cornfield there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
834,1898-145702-0001,if we were to hide ourselves in that no one could find us the army cannot come into it and to morrow it is to march on they crept into the corn but the army did not march on but remained encamped close around them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
835,1898-145702-0002,they sat for two days and two nights in the corn and grew so hungry that they nearly died but if they were to venture out it was certain death they said at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
836,1898-145702-0003,what use was it our deserting we must perish here miserably whilst they were speaking a fiery dragon came flying through the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
837,1898-145702-0004,said they then the dragon seized them in his claws took them through the air over the army and set them down on the earth a long way from it he gave them a little whip saying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
838,1898-145702-0005,then he put a book before them which he made all three of them sign i will then give you a riddle he said if you guess it you shall be free and out of my power the dragon then flew away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
839,1898-145702-0006,and they journeyed on with their little whip they had as much money as they wanted wore grand clothes and made their way into the world wherever they went they lived in merrymaking and splendour drove about with horses and carriages ate and drank but did nothing wrong,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
840,1898-145702-0007,they went into a field sat down and the two pulled long faces an old woman passed by and asked them why they were so sad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
841,1898-145702-0008,only confide your trouble in me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
842,1898-145702-0009,and how he had given them money as plentifully as blackberries but as they had signed their names they were his unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle the old woman said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
843,1898-145702-0010,if you would help yourselves one of you must go into the wood and there he will come upon a tumble down building of rocks which looks like a little house he must go in and there he will find help the two melancholy ones thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
844,1898-145702-0011,that won't save us and they remained where they were but the third and merry one jumped up and went into the wood till he found the rock hut in the hut sat a very old woman who was the dragon's grandmother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
845,1898-145702-0012,she asked him how he came and what was his business there he told her all that happened and because she was pleased with him she took compassion on him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
846,1898-145702-0013,i will tell you this in the north sea lies a dead sea cat that shall be their roast meat and the rib of a whale that shall be their silver spoon and the hollow foot of a dead horse that shall be their wineglass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
847,1898-145702-0014,i know enough and can help myself splendidly then he went by another way through the window secretly and in all haste back to his comrades he told them how the dragon had been outwitted by his grandmother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
848,1898-145702-0015,and how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle then they were all delighted and in high spirits took out their whip and cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground when the seven years had quite gone the fiend came with his book and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
849,1898-145702-0016,pointing at the signatures said i will take you underground with me you shall have a meal there if you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat you shall be free,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
850,1898-145702-0017,then said the first soldier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
851,1898-145702-0018,the dragon made a face and growled again three times hum,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
852,1898-145702-0019,do you know what your wineglass shall be an old horse's hoof shall be our wineglass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
853,1898-145720-0000,far away in north america where the red indians dwell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
854,1898-145720-0001,many of the young braves sought her in marriage but she would listen to one only a handsome chief who had taken her fancy some years before so they were to be married and great rejoicings were made,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
855,1898-145720-0002,but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid thinking of his happiness that was buried there at last after many days a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
856,1898-145720-0003,he remembered having heard from the old old people of the tribe that there was a path that led to the land of souls that if you sought carefully you could find it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
857,1898-145720-0004,so the next morning he got up early and put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders for he knew not how long his journey would take nor what sort of country he would have to go through only one thing he knew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
858,1898-145720-0005,one of the old men say that the land of souls lay to the south and so filled with new hope and courage he set his face southwards for many many miles the country looked the same as it did round his own home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
859,1898-145720-0006,but grew less and less the farther he went south till it disappeared altogether soon the trees put forth their buds and flowers sprang up under his feet and instead of thick clouds there was blue sky over his head and everywhere the birds were singing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
860,1898-145720-0007,and on the top of these he found a hut or wigwam an old man clothed in skins and holding a staff in his hand stood in the doorway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
861,1898-145720-0008,rest in my hut as she also rested and i will tell you what you ask and whither you should go on hearing these words the young man entered the hut but his heart was too eager within him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
862,1898-145720-0009,to suffer him to rest and when he arose the old man rose too and stood with him at the door look he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
863,1898-145720-0010,at the water which lies far out yonder and the plains which stretch beyond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
864,1898-145720-0011,but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
865,1898-145720-0012,instead of hiding as he approached and birds circled round him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
866,1898-145720-0013,very soon he noticed with wonder that neither rocks nor trees barred his path he passed through them without knowing it for indeed they were not rocks and trees at all but only the souls of them for this was the land of shadows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

935,2436-2476-0025,i answered her greeting and met george prince's casual gaze he too smiled as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service i had done her or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when i chased him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

946,2436-2476-0036,he had come into the salon with a swagger his sword ornament clanking a pleasant voyage so far he said to me as he started his meal his voice had the heavy throaty rasp characteristic of the martian he spoke perfect english,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

991,405-130895-0003,what fine oxygen let master have no fears about breathing there's enough for everyone as for ned land he didn't say a word but his wide open jaws would have scared off a shark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
992,405-130895-0004,and what powerful inhalations the canadian drew like a furnace going full blast our strength returned promptly and when i looked around i saw that we were alone on the platform no crewmen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
993,405-130895-0005,those strange seamen on the nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air the first words i pronounced were words of appreciation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
994,405-130895-0006,and gratitude to my two companions ned and conseil had kept me alive during the final hours of our long death throes but no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
995,405-130895-0007,good lord professor ned land answered me don't mention it what did we do that's so praiseworthy not a thing it was a question of simple arithmetic your life is worth more than ours so we had to save it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
996,405-130895-0008,and you my gallant conseil you suffered a great deal not too much to be candid with master i was lacking a few throatfuls of air but i would have gotten by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
997,405-130895-0009,it took my breath away in a manner of confounded by this lapse into banality conseil left his sentence hanging my friends i replied very moved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
998,405-130895-0010,we're bound to each other forever and i'm deeply indebted to you which i'll take advantage of the canadian shot back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
999,405-130895-0011,conseil put in yes ned land went on you can repay your debt by coming with me when i leave this infernal nautilus by the way conseil said are we going in a favorable direction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1000,405-130895-0012,yes i replied because we're going in the direction of the sun and here the sun is due north sure ned land went on but it remains to be seen whether we'll make for the atlantic or the pacific,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1001,405-130895-0013,but if we returned to the pacific far from every populated shore what would happen to ned land's plans we would soon settle this important point the nautilus traveled swiftly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1002,405-130895-0014,soon we had cleared the antarctic circle plus the promontory of cape horn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1003,405-130895-0015,by then all our past sufferings were forgotten the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds we had thoughts only of the future,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1004,405-130895-0016,now then that evening it became obvious much to my satisfaction that we were returning north by the atlantic route i shared the results of my observations with the canadian and conseil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1005,405-130895-0017,that's good news the canadian replied but where's the nautilus going i'm unable to say ned after the south pole,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1006,405-130895-0018,we'll never regret having known him especially once we've left him ned land shot back the next day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1007,405-130895-0019,when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon we raised land to the west,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1008,405-130895-0020,the land of fire a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives huts this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1009,405-130895-0021,its coastline looked flat but high mountains rose in the distance i even thought i glimpsed mt sarmiento,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1010,405-130895-0022,a pyramid shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit which depending on whether it's clear or veiled in vapor predicts fair weather or foul as ned land told me a first class barometer my friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1011,405-130895-0023,yes sir a natural barometer that didn't let me down when i navigated the narrows of the strait of magellan just then its peak appeared before us standing out distinctly against the background of the skies this forecast fair weather,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1012,405-130895-0024,bulb bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens with their smooth viscous filaments they measured as much as three hundred meters long genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1013,405-130895-0025,it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks for crabs and cuttlefish here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal mixing meat from fish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1014,405-130895-0026,with vegetables from the sea like the english with their irish stews the nautilus passed over these lush luxuriant depths with tremendous speed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1015,405-130895-0027,in these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae in particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the world's best mussels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1016,405-130895-0028,as for fish i specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the goby genus especially some gudgeon two decimeters long sprinkled with whitish and yellow spots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1017,405-130895-0029,i likewise marveled at the numerous medusas including the most beautiful of their breed the compass jellyfish unique to the falkland seas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1018,405-130895-0030,some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons others looked like,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1019,405-130895-0031,upside down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1020,405-130895-0032,shadows illusions melting and evaporating outside their native element when the last tips of the falkland islands had disappeared below the horizon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1021,405-130895-0033,between twenty and twenty five meters and went along the south american coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1022,405-130895-0034,didn't put in an appearance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1023,405-130895-0035,keeping to its northerly heading it followed the long windings of south america by then we had fared sixteen thousand leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1024,405-130895-0036,near eleven o'clock in the morning we cut the tropic of capricorn on the thirty seventh meridian passing well out from cape frio much to ned land's displeasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1025,405-130895-0037,captain nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of brazil's populous shores because he shot by with dizzying speed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1026,405-130894-0000,chapter sixteen shortage of air consequently above below and around the nautilus there were impenetrable frozen walls we were the ice bank's prisoners the canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1027,405-130894-0001,conseil kept still i stared at the captain his face had resumed its usual emotionlessness he crossed his arms he pondered the nautilus did not stir the captain then broke into speech gentlemen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1028,405-130894-0002,he said in a calm voice there are two ways of dying under the conditions in which we're placed this inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor working out a problem for his pupils the first way he went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1029,405-130894-0003,is death by crushing the second is death by asphyxiation i don't mention the possibility of death by starvation because the nautilus's provisions will certainly last longer than we will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1030,405-130894-0004,therefore let's concentrate on our chances of being crushed or asphyxiated as for asphyxiation captain i replied that isn't a cause for alarm because the air tanks are full true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1031,405-130894-0005,but they'll supply air for only two days now then we've been buried beneath the waters for thirty six hours and the nautilus's heavy atmosphere already needs renewing in another forty eight hours our reserve air will be used up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1032,405-130894-0006,well then captain let's free ourselves within forty eight hours we'll try to at least by cutting through one of these walls surrounding us which one i asked borings will tell us that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1033,405-130894-0007,i'm going to ground the nautilus on the lower shelf then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the thinnest of these ice walls can the panels in the lounge be left open without ill effect we're no longer in motion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1034,405-130894-0008,hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks the nautilus slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of three hundred fifty meters the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1035,405-130894-0009,my friends i said we're in a serious predicament but i'm counting on your courage and energy sir the canadian replied this is no time to bore you with my complaints,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1036,405-130894-0010,he can use me any way he wants he won't turn down your assistance come along ned i led the canadian to the room where the nautilus's men were putting on their diving suits i informed the captain of ned's proposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1037,405-130894-0011,which was promptly accepted the canadian got into his underwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1038,405-130894-0012,after ned was dressed i reentered the lounge whose windows had been uncovered stationed next to conseil i examined the strata surrounding and supporting the nautilus some moments later we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1039,405-130894-0013,before digging into the ice the captain had to obtain borings to insure working in the best direction long bores were driven into the side walls but after fifteen meters the instruments were still impeded by the thickness of those walls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1040,405-130894-0014,more than four hundred meters high,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1041,405-130894-0015,there we were separated from the sea by a ten meter barrier that's how thick the iceberg was from this point on it was an issue of cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the nautilus's waterline this meant detaching about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1042,405-130894-0016,six thousand five hundred cubic meters to dig a hole through which the ship could descend below this tract of ice work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity instead of digging all around the nautilus which would have entailed even greater difficulties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1043,405-130894-0017,then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter and huge chunks were loosened from its mass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1044,405-130894-0018,these chunks weighed less than the water and by an unusual effect of specific gravity each chunk took wing as it were to the roof of the tunnel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1045,405-130894-0019,but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner after two hours of energetic work ned land reentered exhausted he and his companions were replaced by new workmen including conseil and me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1046,405-130894-0020,the nautilus's chief officer supervised us the water struck me as unusually cold but i warmed up promptly while wielding my pick my movements were quite free although they were executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1047,405-130894-0021,and the nautilus's atmosphere which was already charged with carbon dioxide the air hadn't been renewed in forty eight hours and its life giving qualities were considerably weakened meanwhile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1048,405-130894-0022,after twelve hours had gone by we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick hence about six hundred cubic meters assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1049,405-130894-0023,before the nautilus could return to the surface of the waves couldn't we all die of asphyxiation were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice it was a dreadful state of affairs but we faced it head on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1050,405-130894-0024,each one of us determined to do his duty to the end during the night in line with my forecasts a new one meter slice was removed from this immense socket but in the morning wearing my diving suit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1051,405-130894-0025,when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other the liquid strata farthest from the trench not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools were showing a tendency to solidify in the face of this imminent new danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1052,405-130894-0026,there was no point in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous rescue work but when i returned on board,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1053,405-130894-0027,i know he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook couldn't change it's one more danger but i don't know any way of warding it off our sole chance for salvation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1054,405-130894-0028,is to work faster than the water solidifies we've got to get there first that's all get there first by then i should have been used to this type of talk for several hours that day i wielded my pick doggedly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1055,405-130894-0029,the work kept me going besides working meant leaving the nautilus which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by our equipment which meant leaving the thin foul air behind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1056,405-130894-0030,near evening one more meter had been dug from the trench when i returned on board i was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon dioxide saturating the air oh if only we had the chemical methods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1057,405-130894-0031,there was no lack of oxygen all this water contained a considerable amount,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1058,405-130894-0032,this life giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us i had thought it all out but to no avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship to absorb it we would need to fill containers with potassium hydroxide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1059,405-130894-0033,and shake them continually but this substance was missing on board and nothing else could replace it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1060,405-130894-0034,without this precaution we wouldn't have awakened the following morning the next day march twenty sixth i returned to my miner's trade working to remove the fifth meter the ice bank's side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1061,405-130894-0035,obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free for an instant i was gripped by despair my pick nearly slipped from my hands what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1062,405-130894-0036,a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster jaws irresistibly closing supervising our work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1063,405-130894-0037,working himself captain nemo passed near me just then i touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our prison the starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four meters from the nautilus's hull,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1064,405-130894-0038,the captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him we returned on board my diving suit removed i went with him to the lounge professor aronnax he told me this calls for heroic measures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1065,405-130894-0039,or we'll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement yes i said but what can we do oh he exclaimed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1066,405-130894-0040,if only my nautilus were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed well i asked not catching the captain's meaning don't you understand he went on that the congealing of this water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1067,405-130894-0041,could come to our rescue don't you see that by solidifying it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us just as its freezing can burst the hardest stones aren't you aware that this force could be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1068,405-130894-0042,i know it sir so we can't rely on nature to rescue us only our own efforts we must counteract this solidification we must hold it in check not only are the side walls closing in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1069,405-130894-0043,but there aren't ten feet of water ahead or astern of the nautilus all around us this freeze is gaining fast how long i asked will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to breathe on board the captain looked me straight in the eye,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1070,405-130894-0044,it was now the twenty sixth we had lived off the ship's stores for five days and all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen even today as i write these lines my sensations are so intense,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1071,405-130894-0045,that an involuntary terror sweeps over me and my lungs still seem short of air meanwhile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1072,405-130894-0046,boiling water i exclaimed yes sir we're shut up in a relatively confined area if the nautilus's pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space wouldn't that raise its temperature and delay its freezing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1073,405-130894-0047,it's worth trying i said resolutely so let's try it professor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1074,405-130894-0048,captain nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at work supplying drinking water via evaporation the mechanism was loaded with water and the full electric heat of our batteries was thrown into coils awash in liquid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1075,405-130894-0049,in a few minutes the water reached one hundred degrees centigrade it was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process the heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply going through the mechanism water drawn cold from the sea arrived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1076,405-130894-0050,boiling hot at the body of the pump the steaming water was injected into the icy water outside and after three hours had passed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1077,405-130894-0051,that was one degree gained,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1078,405-130894-0052,after i monitored the operation's progress double checking it with many inspections i told the captain it's working i think so he answered me we've escaped being crushed now we have only asphyxiation to fear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1079,405-130894-0053,the injections couldn't get it to go a single degree higher,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1080,405-130894-0054,i was finally assured that there was no danger of it solidifying by the next day march twenty seventh six meters of ice had been torn from the socket only four meters were left to be removed that still meant forty eight hours of work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1081,405-130894-0055,the air couldn't be renewed in the nautilus's interior accordingly that day it kept getting worse an unbearable heaviness weighed me down near three o'clock in the afternoon this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1082,405-130894-0056,yawns dislocated my jaws my lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing now growing scarcer and scarcer my mind was in a daze i lay outstretched strength gone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1083,405-130894-0057,nearly unconscious my gallant conseil felt the same symptoms suffered the same sufferings yet never left my side he held my hand he kept encouraging me and i even heard him mutter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1084,405-130894-0058,to leave more air for master it brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words since conditions inside were universally unbearable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1085,405-130894-0059,picks rang out on that bed of ice arms grew weary hands were rubbed raw but who cared about exhaustion what difference were wounds life sustaining air reached our lungs we could breathe we could breathe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1086,405-130894-0060,and yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted him his shift over each man surrendered to a gasping companion the air tank that would revive him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1087,405-130894-0061,when his time was up he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on board always calm unflinching and uncomplaining that day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1088,405-130894-0062,over the whole surface area only two meters were left to be removed only two meters separated us from the open sea but the ship's air tanks were nearly empty the little air that remained had to be saved for the workmen not an,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1089,405-130894-0063,atom for the nautilus when i returned on board i felt half suffocated what a night i'm unable to depict it such sufferings are indescribable the next day i was short winded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1090,405-130894-0064,headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me reel like a drunk my companions were experiencing the same symptoms some crewmen were at their last gasp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1091,405-130894-0065,and he decided to crush this layer the man had kept his energy and composure he had subdued physical pain with moral strength he could still think plan and act at his orders the craft was eased off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1092,405-130894-0066,in other words it was raised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity when it was afloat the crew towed it leading it right above the immense trench outlined to match the ship's waterline next the ballast tanks filled with water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1093,405-130894-0067,the boat sank and was fitted into its socket just then the whole crew returned on board and the double outside door was closed by this point the nautilus was resting on a bed of ice only one meter thick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1094,405-130894-0068,we listened we forgot our sufferings we hoped once more we had staked our salvation on this one last gamble despite the buzzing in my head i soon could hear vibrations under the nautilus's hull we tilted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1095,405-130894-0069,the ice cracked with an odd ripping sound like paper tearing and the nautilus began settling downward we're going through conseil muttered in my ear i couldn't answer him i clutched his hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1096,405-130894-0070,i squeezed it in an involuntary convulsion all at once carried away by its frightful excess load the nautilus sank into the waters like a cannonball in other words dropping as if in a vacuum,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1097,405-130894-0071,our full electric power was then put on the pumps which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks after a few minutes we had checked our fall the pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1098,405-130894-0072,brought to full speed the propeller made the sheet iron hull tremble down to its rivets and we sped northward but how long would it take to navigate under the ice bank to the open sea another day i would be dead first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1099,405-130894-0073,my muscles had no power to contract i'm unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way but i was aware that my death throes had begun i realized that i was about to die suddenly i regained consciousness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1100,405-130894-0074,a few whiffs of air had entered my lungs had we risen to the surface of the waves had we cleared the ice bank no ned and conseil my two gallant friends were sacrificing themselves to save me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1101,405-130894-0075,instead of breathing it themselves they had saved it for me and while they were suffocating they poured life into me drop by drop i tried to push the device away they held my hands and for a few moments i could breathe luxuriously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1102,405-130894-0076,my eyes flew toward the clock it was eleven in the morning it had to be march twenty eighth the nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of forty miles per hour it was writhing in the waters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1103,405-130894-0077,had he perished had his companions died with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1104,405-130894-0078,separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice could we break through it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1105,4137-11701-0000,and now said coronel we'd better decide what to do but i don't mind what we do now said hyacinth happily she may have the throne and father and udo and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1106,4137-11701-0001,that's what makes it so jolly we can do what we like and it doesn't matter if it doesn't come off so just for fun let's think of something to pay her out i feel i don't want to hurt anybody to day all right we won't hurt her we'll humour her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1107,4137-11701-0002,we will be her most humble obedient servants she shall have everything she wants including prince udo smiled hyacinth that's a splendid idea we'll make her have udo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1108,4137-11701-0003,it will annoy your father but one can't please everybody oh i can see myself enjoying this they got up and wandered back along wiggs's path hand in hand i'm almost afraid to leave the forest said hyacinth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1109,4137-11701-0004,in case something happens what should happen i don't know but all our life together has been in the forest and i'm just a little afraid of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1110,4137-11701-0005,be very close coronel she whispered and then they walked out together if any of the servants at the palace were surprised to see coronel they did not show it after all that was their business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1111,4137-11701-0006,prince coronel will be staying here said the princess prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both and if they discussed those things in the servants halls of those days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1112,4137-11701-0007,no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth bless her pretty face had found her man at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1113,4137-11701-0008,but i get no assistance from roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders i say said coronel as they went up the grand staircase i am not a prince you know don't say i have deceived you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1114,4137-11701-0009,you are my prince said hyacinth proudly my dear i am a king among men to day and you are my queen but that's in our own special country of two if you are so particular said hyacinth with a smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1115,4137-11701-0010,father will make you a proper prince directly he comes back will he that's what i'm wondering you see he doesn't know yet about our little present to the countess but it is quite time we got back to belvane we have left her alone too long,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1116,4137-11701-0011,it was more than udo did just now he was with her in her garden telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with a dragon apparently in its dotage to which belvane was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1117,4137-11701-0012,and then said udo i jumped quickly to the right and whirling my no wait a bit that was later i jumped quickly to my left yes i remember it now it was my left i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1118,4137-11701-0013,he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvane's face she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him why whoever is this she said getting to her feet before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1119,4137-11701-0014,the princess and coronel were upon them ah countess i thought we should find you together said hyacinth archly let me present to you my friend the duke coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1120,4137-11701-0015,udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bewildered highness on the back aren't you udo and i can think of no one more suitable in every way he bowed again and turned back to the prince well udo you're looking splendid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1121,4137-11701-0016,a different thing countess from when i last saw him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1122,4137-11701-0017,ah what a miracle worker true love is i think one of the things which made belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1123,4137-11701-0018,meanwhile udo of course blundered along gaily we aren't exactly princess i mean what are you doing here coronel i didn't know princess that you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1124,4137-11701-0019,the countess and i were just having a little i was just telling her what you said about how did you get here coronel shall we tell him said coronel with a smile at hyacinth hyacinth nodded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1125,4137-11701-0020,i rode said coronel it's a secret he added,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1126,4137-11701-0021,explained hyacinth and hearing that there was to be a wedding added coronel belvane made up her mind coronel was evidently a very different man from udo if he stayed in euralia as adviser,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1127,4137-11701-0022,more than adviser she guessed to hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt and as for the king it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1128,4137-11701-0023,we didn't want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our secret your royal highness she looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1129,4137-11701-0024,udo and i here she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronel's took udo's boldly without any more maidenly nonsense udo and i love each other say something udo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1130,4137-11701-0025,prompted coronel er yes said udo very unwillingly and deciding he would explain it all afterwards whatever his feelings for the countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage oh i'm so glad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1131,4137-11701-0026,said hyacinth i felt somehow that it must be coming because you've seen so much of each other lately wiggs and i have often talked about it together what has happened to the child thought belvane she isn't a child at all she's grown up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1132,4137-11701-0027,there's no holding udo once he begins volunteered coronel he's the most desperate lover in araby my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1133,4137-11701-0028,you know of course that his majesty comes back to morrow with all his army she did not swoon or utter a cry she did not plead the vapours or the megrims,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1134,4137-11701-0029,she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace she said if your royal highness will excuse me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1135,4137-11701-0030,and with a curtsey she was gone coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth i'm enjoying this he seemed to say well she announced i must be going in too there'll be much to see about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1136,4137-11701-0031,and now said the prince tell me what you are doing here coronel put his arm in udo's and walked him up and down the flagged path your approaching marriage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1137,4137-11701-0032,he said is the talk of araby naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was like my dear udo she's charming i congratulate you don't be a fool coronel i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1138,4137-11701-0033,there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1139,4137-11701-0034,yes i think you may take our word for it that it's true i haven't the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1140,4137-11701-0035,oh very well if you're going to drop all your former friends go on then but when i'm married there will always be a place for understand once and for all said udo angrily that i am not getting married no don't take my arm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1141,4137-11701-0036,we can talk quite well like this i am sorry udo said coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position it wasn't in the least compromising,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1142,4137-11701-0037,protested udo indignantly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1143,4137-11701-0038,ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1144,4137-11701-0039,once more i am not going to marry her well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story poor innocent girl well let's forget about it and now tell me how do you like euralia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1145,4137-11701-0040,said udo stiffly well perhaps you're right i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way udo who was about to enter the palace turned round with a startled look what do you mean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1146,4137-11701-0041,you never told me your precious countess whom you expect me to marry how very unkind of her a nasty person to annoy he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1147,4137-11701-0042,udo evidently hadn't thought of this he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened she couldn't do anything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1148,4137-11701-0043,yes but of course the chance might come again you'd have the thing hanging over you always she's clever you know and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy lovely flowers aren't they what's the name of this one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1149,4137-11701-0044,udo dropped undecidedly into a seat this wanted thinking out the countess what was wrong with her after all and she evidently adored him of course that was not surprising the question was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1150,4137-11701-0045,was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for after all he had been no more gallant than was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1151,4137-11701-0046,of course he ought to have left euralia long ago but he had stayed on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that and he had certainly neglected the princess a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1152,4137-11701-0047,after all again why not marry the countess it was absurd to suppose there was anything in coronel's nonsense but one never knew not that he was marrying her out of fear no certainly not it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1153,4137-11701-0048,the poor woman had misunderstood him and she should not be disappointed she seems fond of flowers said coronel you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you now understand clearly coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1154,4137-11701-0049,i'm not in the least frightened by the countess my dear udo what a speech for a lover of course you're not after all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1155,4137-11701-0050,i must ask you not to refer to it if i marry the countess you'll be a very lucky man put in coronel i happen to know that the king of euralia however she's chosen you it seems,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1156,4137-11701-0051,personally i can't make out what she sees in you what is it i should have thought it was quite obvious said udo with dignity well coronel i think perhaps you are right and that it's my duty to marry her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1157,4137-11701-0052,coronel shook him solemnly by the hand i congratulate your royal highness i will announce your decision to the princess she will be much amu much delighted and he turned into the palace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1159,4137-11702-0001,so far as is known this was her only work but she built up some reputation on it and belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius to be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1174,4137-11702-0016,in honour of our great victory i decree that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout euralia terrific cheering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1175,4137-11702-0017,here he turned and embraced his daughter again and if his eye travelled over her shoulder in the direction of belvane's garden it is a small matter and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1176,4137-11702-0018,there was another storm of cheers the battle cry of euralia ho ho merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes hyacinth and merriwig went into the palace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1177,4137-11702-0019,now father said hyacinth later on when merriwig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself you've got to tell me all about it i can hardly believe it's really over yes yes it's all over,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1178,4137-11702-0020,said merriwig heartily we shan't have any trouble in that direction again i fancy do tell me did the king of barodia apologise he did better than that he abdicated why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1179,4137-11702-0021,well said merriwig remembering just in time i er killed him oh father how rough of you i don't think it hurt him very much my dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1180,4137-11702-0022,see i have brought these home for you he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper oh how exciting whatever can it be merriwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1181,4137-11702-0023,neatly tied up with blue ribbon father he picked out the left one fons et origo if he had known any latin of the war and held it up for hyacinth's inspection there you can see the place where henry smallnose's arrow bent it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1182,4137-11702-0024,by the way he added henry is marrying and settling down in barodia it is curious he went on how after a war one's thoughts turn to matrimony he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1183,4137-11702-0025,but she was still engrossed with the whiskers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1184,4137-11702-0026,i can't plant them in the garden i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia isn't that a little unkind now that the poor man's dead merriwig looked round him to see that there were no eavesdroppers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1185,4137-11702-0027,can you keep a secret he asked mysteriously of course said hyacinth deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told coronel well then listen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1186,4137-11702-0028,he told her of his secret journey to the king of barodia's tent he told her of the king of barodia's letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1187,4137-11702-0029,and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1188,4137-11702-0030,to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings and by and by the moment came of which coronel had spoken and now said merriwig,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1189,4137-11702-0031,nothing much i suppose he waited nervously wondering if hyacinth would realise that all was meant to include more particularly belvane hyacinth drew a stool up to her father's chair and sat down very close to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1190,4137-11702-0032,father she said stroking his hand where it rested on his knee i have got some news for you nothing about the coun nothing serious i hope said merriwig in alarm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1191,4137-11702-0033,it's rather serious but it's rather nice father dear would you mind very much if i got married soon my dear you shall get married as soon as you like let me see there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1192,4137-11702-0034,i sent them off on adventures of some kind but dear me yes they ought to have been back by now i suppose you haven't heard anything of them no father said hyacinth with a little smile ah well no doubt they were unsuccessful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1193,4137-11702-0035,no matter dear we can easily find you plenty more suitors indeed the subject has been very near my thoughts lately we'll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighbouring countries there'll be no lack of candidates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1194,4137-11702-0036,let me see there's that seven headed bull he's getting a little old now but he was good enough for the last one we might i don't want a suitor said hyacinth softly i have one merriwig leant forward with eagerness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1195,4137-11702-0037,my dear this is indeed news tell me all about it upon what quest did you send him hyacinth had felt this coming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1196,4137-11702-0038,what is his income a man must prove his worth in some way i haven't sent him away at all yet she said he's only just come he's been very kind to me and i'm sure you'll love him well well we'll arrange something for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1197,4137-11702-0039,by the way who is he he comes from araby and his name is udo of course why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement my dear it isn't udo i'm afraid father it's coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1198,4137-11702-0040,and who might coronel be said the king rather sternly he's he's well he's here he is father she ran up to him impulsively as he came in at the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1199,4137-11702-0041,oh coronel you're just in time do tell father who you are coronel bowed profoundly to the king before i explain myself your majesty he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1200,4137-11702-0042,may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the barodians from the little i have gathered outside it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred but of course i am longing to hear the full story from your majesty's own lips,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1201,4137-11702-0043,is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of barodia's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1202,4137-11702-0044,he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure an adventure after his own heart merriwig was in an awkward position he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room leave us my child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1203,4137-11702-0045,he would say these are matters for men to discuss but hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell coronel the truth of the matter afterwards it really looked as if coronel would have to be let into the secret too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1204,4137-11702-0046,there are certain state reasons he said with dignity why that story has been allowed to get about pardon your majesty i have no wish to but as you know so much you may as well know all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1205,4137-11702-0047,it happened like this once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the king's letter to him but your majesty cried coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1206,4137-11702-0048,so you like it said merriwig trying to look modest i love it i knew he'd love it put in hyacinth it's just the sort of story that coronel would love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1207,4137-11702-0049,tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war and how you pretended to be a swineherd and how could any father have resisted in a little while hyacinth and coronel were seated eagerly at his feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1208,4137-11702-0050,and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures well well said the king at the end of it when he had received their tribute of admiration those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in war time he turned to coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1209,4137-11702-0051,and so you i understand wish to marry my daughter does that surprise your majesty well no it doesn't and she i understand wishes to marry you yes please father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1210,4137-11702-0052,that said coronel simply is much more surprising merriwig however was not so sure of that he liked the look of coronel he liked his manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1211,4137-11702-0053,and he saw at once that he knew a good story when he heard one of course he said you'll have to win her anything your majesty sets me to do it's as well he added with a disarming smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1212,4137-11702-0054,that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia there is only one man who could have got those truly an excellent young man well we'll arrange something said merriwig looking pleased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1213,4137-11702-0055,perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor too hyacinth and coronel interchanged a smile alas father she said his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1214,4137-11702-0056,wait till he has seen them my dear said merriwig with a chuckle he has seen them father what you invited him here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1215,4137-11702-0057,he came to stay with you and he never his royal highness put in coronel has given his affections to another aha so that's the secret now i wonder if i can guess who she is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1216,4137-11702-0058,what do you say to the princess elvira of tregong i know his father had hopes in that direction hyacinth looked round at coronel as if appealing for his support he took a step towards her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1217,4137-11702-0059,no it's not the princess elvira said hyacinth a little nervously the king laughed good humouredly ah well you must tell me he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1218,4137-11702-0060,hyacinth put out her hand and coronel pressed it encouragingly his royal highness prince udo she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1219,8419-286676-0000,the clever water adder none of the pond people were alone more than the water adders the snapping turtle was left to himself a great deal until the day when he and belostoma drove away the boys after that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1220,8419-286676-0001,his neighbors began to understand him better and he was less grumpy so that those who wore shells were soon quite fond of him belostoma did not have many friends among the smaller people and only a few among the larger ones they said that he was cruel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1221,8419-286676-0002,and that he had a bad habit of using his stout sucking tube to sting with still belostoma did not care he said a giant water bug does not always live in the water i shall have my wings soon and leave the water and marry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1222,8419-286676-0003,after that i shall fly away on my wedding trip missus belostoma may go with me if she feels like doing so after laying her eggs here i shall go anyway and i shall flutter and sprawl around the light and sting people who bother me and have a happy time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1223,8419-286676-0004,that was belostoma's way he would sting people who bothered him but then he always said that they need not have bothered him and perhaps that was so with the water adders it was different they were good natured enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1224,8419-286676-0005,yet the mud turtles and snapping turtle were the only ones who ever called upon them and found them at home the small people without shells were afraid of them and the clams and pond snails never called upon any one the minnows said they could not bear the looks of the adders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1225,8419-286676-0006,they had such ugly mouths and such quick motions the larger fishes kept away on account of their children who were small and tender one might think that the sand hill cranes the fish hawks and the other shore families would have been good friends for them but when they called,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1226,8419-286676-0007,the adders were always away people said that the adders were afraid of them the yellow brown frog wished that the adders could be scared badly scared some time so scared that a chilly feeling would run down their backs from their heads clear to the tips of their tails,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1227,8419-286676-0008,i wish said he that the chilly feeling would be big enough to go way through to their bellies their bellies are only the front side of their backs anyway he added because they are so thin of course this was a dreadful wish to make,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1228,8419-286676-0009,but people said that one of the adders had frightened the yellow brown frog so that he never got over it and this was the reason he felt so the water adders were certainly the cleverest people in the pond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1229,8419-286676-0010,she could do almost anything and she knew it she talked about it too and that showed bad taste and was one reason why she was not liked better she could swim very fast could creep glide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1230,8419-286676-0011,catch hold of things with her tail hang herself from the branch of a tree lift her head far into the air leap dart bound and dive all her family could do these things but she could do them a little the best one day she was hanging over the pond in a very graceful position,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1231,8419-286676-0012,with her tail twisted carelessly around a willow branch the snapping turtle and a mud turtle father were in the shallow water below her her slender forked tongue was darting in and out of her open mouth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1232,8419-286676-0013,it is useful in feeling of things she said and then i have always thought it quite becoming she could see herself reflected in the still water below her and she noticed how prettily the dark brown of her back shaded into the white of her belly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1233,8419-286676-0014,you see she was vain as well as clever the snapping turtle felt cross to day and had come to see if a talk with her would not make him feel better the mud turtle was tired of having the children sprawl around him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1234,8419-286676-0015,and of missus mud turtle telling about the trouble she had to get the right kind of food the clever water adder spoke first of the weather it must be dreadfully hot for the shore people she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1235,8419-286676-0016,and fly around in the sunshine to find food for their children ah yes said the mud turtle how they must wish for shells humph said the snapping turtle what for to fly with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1236,8419-286676-0017,let them come in swimming with their children if they are warm and tired the water adder laughed in her snaky way and showed her sharp teeth i have heard she said that when the wild ducks bring their children here to swim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1237,8419-286676-0018,they do not always take so many home as they brought the snapping turtle became very much interested in his warty right foreleg and did not seem to hear what she said the mud turtle smiled i have heard she went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1238,8419-286676-0019,that when young ducks dive head first they are quite sure to come up again but that when they dive feet first they never come up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1239,8419-286676-0020,asked the snapping turtle and he was snappy about it oh nothing replied the water adder swinging her head back and forth and looking at the scales on her body i know what you mean said the snapping turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1240,8419-286676-0021,and you know what you mean but i have to eat something and if i am swimming under the water and a duckling paddles along just above me and sticks his foot into my mouth i am likely to swallow him before i think the water adder saw that he was provoked by what she had said so she talked about something else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1241,8419-286676-0022,i think the ducks spoil their children said she they make such a fuss over them and they are not nearly so bright as my children why mine hatch as soon as the eggs are laid and go hunting at once they are no trouble at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1242,8419-286676-0023,i never worry about mine said the mud turtle although their mother thinks it is not safe for them all to sleep at once as they do on a log in the sunshine it isn't said the adder decidedly i never close my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1243,8419-286676-0024,most of them remarked the turtles all of them she said except us adders and the turtles i even think that some of the turtles are a little queer don't you we have thought so said the mud turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1244,8419-286676-0025,they certainly are agreed the snapping turtle who was beginning to feel much better natured what did you say asked the adder who like all her family was a little deaf ouch exclaimed the snapping turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1245,8419-286676-0026,ouch ouch what is the matter asked the mud turtle then he began to slap the water with his short stout tail and say ouch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1246,8419-286676-0027,two naughty young water boatmen had swum quietly up on their backs and stung the turtles on their tails then they swam away pushing themselves quickly through the water with swift strokes of their hairy oar legs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1247,8419-286676-0028,and he backed into the mud knowing that fine soft mud is the best thing in the world for stings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1248,8419-286676-0029,if i could only reach my tail with my head or even with one of my hind feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1249,8419-286676-0030,asked the water adder in her sweetest voice nothing is easier and she wound herself around the willow branch in another graceful position and took the tip of her tail daintily between her teeth humph said the snapping turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1250,8419-286676-0031,and he pulled his tail out of the mud and swam away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1251,8419-286676-0032,said the mud turtle and he swam away with the snapping turtle what a rude person she is they said always trying to show how much more clever she is than other people we would rather be stupid and polite after a while the snapping turtle said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1252,8419-286676-0033,but then you know we are not stupid of course not replied the mud turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1253,8419-286667-0000,the dance of the sand hill cranes one fine day in spring a great flock of sand hill cranes came from the south they were flying high and quietly because the weather was bright if it had been stormy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1254,8419-286667-0001,or if they had been flying by night as they usually did they would have stayed nearer the ground and their leader would have trumpeted loudly to let his followers know which way he was going they would also have trumpeted but more softly to tell him that they were coming after,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1255,8419-286667-0002,they were a fine company to look upon orderly strong and dignified their long necks were stretched out straight ahead their long legs straight behind and they beat the air with slow regular strokes of the strong wings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1256,8419-286667-0003,as they came near the pond they flew lower and lower until all swept down to the earth and alighted tall and stately by the edge of the water they had eaten nothing for several days and were soon hunting for food some on land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1257,8419-286667-0004,and some in the water for they had stopped to feed and rest those who hunted in the water did so very quietly a crane would stand on one leg with his head against his breast so quietly that one might think him asleep but as soon as anything eatable came near,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1258,8419-286667-0005,he would bend his body stretch out his neck open his long slender bill and swallow it at one gulp then he would seem to fall asleep again while most of the cranes were still feeding some of them were stalking through the woods and looking this way and that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1259,8419-286667-0006,they were those who thought of staying there for the summer when the flock arose to fly on again eight cranes stayed behind they watched their friends fly away and stood on the ground with their necks and bills uplifted and mouths open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1260,8419-286667-0007,while they trumpeted or called out good bye stop for us in the fall the flying cranes trumpeted back we will don't forget us that night they slept near together as they had done when with the large flock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1261,8419-286667-0008,and one crane kept awake to watch for danger while the others tucked their heads under their wings they were fine looking even when they slept and some people never look well unless they are awake they were brownish gray with no bright markings at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1262,8419-286667-0009,and their long legs gave them a very genteel look the tops of their heads were covered with warty red skin from which grew short black feathers that looked more like hairs one morning when the cranes awakened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1263,8419-286667-0010,a fine young fellow began to strut up and down before the rest bowing low and leaping high into the air and every now and then whooping as loudly as he could the gulls who had spent the winter by the pond screamed to each other the crane dance has begun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1264,8419-286667-0011,even the frogs who are afraid of cranes crept quietly near to look on it was not long before another young crane began to skip and hop and circle around drooping his wings and whooping as he went,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1265,8419-286667-0012,every crane danced brothers and sisters and all and as they did so they looked lovingly at each other and admired the fine steps and enjoyed the whooping this went on until they were so tired they could hardly stand and had to stop to eat and rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1266,8419-286667-0013,when they were eating the young fellow who had begun the dance stalked up to the sister of one of his friends as she stood in the edge of the pond gracefully balanced on one leg she did not turn her head towards him although having such a long and slender neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1267,8419-286667-0014,she stood with her head on her breast and looked at the water after a while he trumpeted softly as though he were just trying his voice then she gave a pretty little start and said oh are you here how you did frighten me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1268,8419-286667-0015,i am sorry he said i did not want to frighten you and he looked at her admiringly it was just for a minute she answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1269,8419-286667-0016,then they stood and fished for a long time without saying anything when she flew away she said that is a very pleasant fishing place he stood on the other leg for a while and thought how sweet her voice sounded as she said it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1270,8419-286667-0017,then he thought that if she liked the place so well she might come there again the next day he wondered why he could not come too although everybody knows that a crane catches more if he fishes alone the next morning when the cranes danced,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1271,8419-286667-0018,he bowed to her oftener than to any of the rest and he thought she noticed it they danced until they were almost too tired to move,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1272,8419-286667-0019,as she stalked off toward the pond she passed him and she said over her shoulder i should think you would be hungry i am almost starved after she had gone he wondered why she had said that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1273,8419-286667-0020,if he had been an older crane and understood the ways of the world a little better he would have known that she meant aren't you coming to that fishing place i am going now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1274,8419-286667-0021,still although he was such a young crane and had never danced until this year he began to think that she liked him and enjoyed having him near so he flew off to the fishing place where he had seen her the day before and he stalked along to where she was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1275,8419-286667-0022,he pitied short necked people then he said pooh i can take bigger mouthfuls than that you ought to see what big mouthfuls i can take she changed and stood on her other leg i saw you dancing this morning she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1276,8419-286667-0023,for all the eight cranes had danced together but he thought it very wonderful did you notice to whom i bowed he asked he was so excited that his knees shook and he had to stand on both legs at once to keep from falling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1277,8419-286667-0024,when a crane is as much excited as that it is pretty serious to my sister she asked carelessly as she drew one of her long tail feathers through her beak no said he i bowed to her sister,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1278,8419-286667-0025,and she said she couldn't remember that she never could remember what she had forgotten it made him feel very badly to have her leave him so he wanted a chance to tell her something yet whenever he tried to it seemed to stick in his bill he began to fear that she didn't like him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1279,8419-286667-0026,and the next time the cranes danced he didn't bow to her so much but he strutted and leaped and whooped even more and she strutted and leaped and whooped almost as loudly as he when they were all tired out and had stopped dancing she said to him i am so tired,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1280,8419-286667-0027,let us go off into the woods and rest you may be very sure he was glad to go and as he stalked off with her he led the way to a charming nesting place he didn't know just how to tell what he wanted to but he had seen another crane bowing to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1281,8419-286667-0028,and was afraid she might marry him if he was not quick now he pointed with one wing to this nesting place and said how would you like to build a nest there she looked where he had pointed i she said why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1282,8419-286667-0029,it is a lovely place but i could never have a nest alone let me help you he said i want to marry and have a home why said she as she preened her feathers that is a very good plan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1283,8419-286667-0030,when did you think of it so they were married and missus sand hill crane often told her friends afterward that mister crane was so much in love with her that she just had to marry him they were very very happy and after a while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1284,8419-293473-0000,the dignified walking sticks three walking sticks from the forest had come to live in the big maple tree near the middle of the meadow nobody knew exactly why they had left the forest where all their sisters and cousins and aunts lived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1285,8419-293473-0001,perhaps they were not happy with their relatives but then if one is a walking stick you know one does not care so very much about one's family these walking sticks had grown up the best way they could with no father or mother to care for them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1286,8419-293473-0002,they had never been taught to do anything useful or to think much about other people when they were hungry they ate some leaves and never thought what they should eat the next time that they happened to be hungry when they were tired they went to sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1287,8419-293473-0003,and when they had slept enough they awakened they had nothing to do but to eat and sleep and they did not often take the trouble to think they felt that they were a little better than those meadow people who rushed and scrambled and worked from morning until night and they showed very plainly how they felt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1288,8419-293473-0004,they said it was not genteel to hurry no matter what happened one day the tree frog was under the tree when the large brown walking stick decided to lay some eggs he saw her dropping them carelessly around on the ground and asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1289,8419-293473-0005,do you never fix a place for your eggs a place said the brown walking stick waving her long and slender feelers to and fro a place oh no i think they will hatch where they are it is too much trouble to find a place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1290,8419-293473-0006,some mothers do not think it too much trouble to be careful where they lay eggs that may be said the brown walking stick but they do not belong to our family she spoke as if those who did not belong to her family might be good but could never be genteel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1291,8419-293473-0007,she had once told her brother the five legged walking stick that she would not want to live if she could not be genteel she thought the meadow people very common the five legged walking stick looked much like his sister he had the same long slender body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1292,8419-293473-0008,the same long feelers and the same sort of long slender legs if you had passed them in a hay field you would surely have thought each a stem of hay unless you happened to see them move the other walking stick their friend was younger and green,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1293,8419-293473-0009,he knew just what to expect so when the nuthatch set him down on the bark to look at him he unhooked his feet from the bark and tumbled to the ground the nuthatch tried to catch him and broke off one of his legs but she never found him again although she looked and looked and looked and looked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1294,8419-293473-0010,that was because he crawled into a clump of ferns and kept very still his sister came and looked at him and said now if you were only a spider it would not be long before you would have six legs again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1295,8419-293473-0011,of course you know spiders never do have a hundred and a walking stick wouldn't be walking without any but that was just his way of speaking and it showed what kind of insect he was his relatives all waved their feelers one at a time and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1296,8419-293473-0012,ah he has the true walking stick spirit then they paid no more attention to him and after a while he and his sister and their green little friend left the forest for the meadow on the day when the grass was cut they had sat quietly in their trees and looked genteel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1297,8419-293473-0013,their feelers were held quite close together and they did not move their feet at all only swayed their bodies gracefully from side to side now they were on the ground hunting through the flat piles of cut grass for some fresh and juicy bits to eat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1298,8419-293473-0014,the ants were scrambling around as busy as ever and life went on quite as though neither men nor horses had ever entered the meadow see cried a spider who was busily looking after her web there comes a horse drawing something and the farmer sitting on it and driving,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1299,8419-293473-0015,when the horse was well into the meadow the farmer moved a bar and the queer looking machine began to kick the grass this way and that with its many stiff and shining legs a frisky young grasshopper kicked in the same way and happened just happened of course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1300,8419-293473-0016,then there was a great scrambling and the crickets frolicked with them the young walking stick thought it looked like great fun and almost wished herself some other kind of insect so that she could tumble around in the same way she did not quite wish it you understand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1301,8419-293473-0017,and would never have thought of it if she had turned brown ah said the five legged walking stick what scrambling how very common yes indeed said his sister why can't they learn to move slowly and gracefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1302,8419-293473-0018,perhaps they can't help being fat but they might at least act genteel what is it to be genteel asked a grasshopper suddenly he had heard every word that the walking stick said why said the five legged walking stick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1303,8419-293473-0019,it is just to be genteel to act as you see us act and to just here the hay tedder passed over them and every one of the walking sticks was sent flying through the air and landed on his back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1304,8419-293473-0020,the walking sticks looked very uncomfortable and the brother and sister could not think of anything to say it was the young green one who spoke at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1305,8419-293469-0000,in all the meadow there was nobody who could tell such interesting stories as the old tree frog even the garter snake who had been there the longest and the old cricket who had lived in the farm yard could tell no such exciting tales as the tree frog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1306,8419-293469-0001,all the wonderful things of which he told had happened before he came to the meadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1307,8419-293469-0002,none of his friends had known him then but he was an honest fellow and they were sure that everything he told was true besides they must be true for how could a body ever think out such remarkable tales from his own head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1308,8419-293469-0003,when he first came to his home by the elm tree he was very thin and looked as though he had been sick the katydids who stayed near said that he croaked in his sleep and that you know is not what well and happy frogs should do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1309,8419-293469-0004,one day when many of the meadow people were gathered around him he told them his story when i was a little fellow he said i was strong and well and could leap farther than any other frog of my size,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1310,8419-293469-0005,i was hatched in the pond beyond the farm house and ate my way from the egg to the water outside like any other frog perhaps i ought to say like any other tadpole for of course i began life as a tadpole,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1311,8419-293469-0006,i played and ate with my brothers and sisters and little dreamed what trouble was in store for me when i grew up we were all in a hurry to be frogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1312,8419-293469-0007,oh how happy we were then i remember the day when my hind legs began to grow and how the other tadpoles crowded around me in the water and swam close to me to feel the two little bunches that were to be legs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1313,8419-293469-0008,my fore legs did not grow until later and these bunches came just in front of my tail your tail cried a puzzled young cricket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1314,8419-293469-0009,i did have when i was a tadpole said the tree frog i had a beautiful wiggly little tail with which to swim through the waters of the pond but as my legs grew larger and stronger my tail grew littler and weaker until there wasn't any tail left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1315,8419-293469-0010,the knobs on the ends of my toes were sticky so that i could climb a tree and then i was ready to start on my travels some of the other frogs started with me but they stopped along the way and at last i was alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1316,8419-293469-0011,i was a bold young fellow and when i saw a great white thing among the trees up yonder i made up my mind to see what it was there was a great red thing in the yard beside it but i liked the white one better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1317,8419-293469-0012,i hopped along as fast as i could for i did not then know enough to be afraid i got close up to them both and saw strange big creatures going in and out of the red thing the barn as i afterward found it was called,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1318,8419-293469-0013,the largest creatures had four legs and some of them had horns the smaller creatures had only two legs on which to walk and two other limbs of some sort with which they lifted and carried things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1319,8419-293469-0014,the queerest thing about it was that the smaller creatures seemed to make the larger ones do whatever they wanted them to they even made some of them help do their work you may not believe me but what i tell you is true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1320,8419-293469-0015,as you may guess i stayed there a long time watching these strange creatures work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1321,8419-293469-0016,there were some bright colored flowers near the house and i crawled in among them there i rested until sunset and then began my evening song while i was singing one of the people from the house came out and found me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1322,8419-293469-0017,she picked me up and carried me inside oh how frightened i was my heart thumped as though it would burst and i tried my best to get away from her she didn't hurt me at all but she would not let me go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1323,8419-293469-0018,she put me in a very queer prison at first when she put me down on a stone in some water i did not know that i was in prison i tried to hop away and bump went my head against something,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1324,8419-293469-0019,wonderful indeed and at the top continued the tree frog was something white over the doorway into my prison in the bottom were water and a stone and from the bottom to the top was a ladder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1325,8419-293469-0020,i had enough to eat but anybody who has been free cannot be happy shut in i watched my chance and three times i got out when the little door was not quite closed twice i was caught and put back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1326,8419-293469-0021,in the pleasant weather of course i went to the top of the ladder and when it was going to rain i would go down again every time that i went up or down those dreadful creatures would put their faces up close to my prison,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1327,8419-293469-0022,and i could hear a roaring sound which meant they were talking and laughing the last time i got out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1328,8419-293469-0023,after they stopped hunting the wind blew the door open and i hopped out you don't say exclaimed a grasshopper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1329,8419-293469-0024,but for a long time i could not sleep without dreaming that i was back in prison and i would croak in my sleep at the thought of it i heard you cried the katydid and i wondered what was the matter matter enough said the tree frog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1330,8419-293469-0025,it makes my skin dry to think of it now and friends the best way i can ever repay your kindness to me is to tell you to never never never never go near the farm house and they all answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1331,3699-19402-0000,could have vented such an insinuation he was however frank and generous in his nature and at all times open to conviction so that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1332,3699-19402-0001,when his conscience smote him my mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted under his right in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1333,3699-19402-0002,she raised her fingers and let them fall it could scarce be call'd a tap or if it was a tap,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1334,3699-19402-0003,whether twas a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession my father who was all sensibilities from head to foot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1335,3699-19402-0004,conscience redoubled her blow he turn'd his face suddenly the other way and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards by a cross movement of her right leg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1336,3699-19402-0005,a thin blue chill pellucid chrystal with all its humours so at rest the least mote or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of it had it existed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1337,3699-19402-0006,my mother madam was so at no time either by nature by institution or example a temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of the year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1338,3699-19402-0007,which having little or no meaning in them nature is oft times obliged to find one and as for my father's example twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1339,3699-19402-0008,that twas the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head nature had done her part to have spared him this trouble and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1340,3699-19402-0009,and here am i sitting this twelfth day of august seventeen sixty six in a purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers without either wig or cap on a most tragicomical completion of his prediction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1341,3699-19402-0010,for certainly key holes were made for other purposes and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a key hole to be what it was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1342,3699-19402-0011,it became a violation of nature and was so far you see criminal it is for this reason an please your reverences that key holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1343,3699-19402-0012,though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle toby's great ramallie wig into pipes yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1344,3699-19402-0013,twould have cost her ladyship a smile it curl'd every where but where the corporal would have it and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it honour he could as soon have raised the dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1345,3699-19402-0014,such it was or rather such would it have seem'd upon any other brow but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle toby's assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1347,3699-19402-0016,in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made by a total inactivity in my uncle toby's life for he seldom went further than the bowling green,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1348,3699-19402-0017,and to shorten all description they shone so bright against the sun that morning and had so metallick and doughty an air with them that had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armour nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1350,3699-19402-0019,a whiff of military pride had puff'd out his shirt at the wrist and upon that in a black leather thong clipp'd into a tassel beyond the knot hung the corporal's stick my uncle toby carried his cane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1352,3699-19402-0021,my uncle toby turn'd his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal and the corporal as oft as he did it gave a slight flourish with his stick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1353,3699-19402-0022,but not vapouringly and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement bid his honour never fear now my uncle toby did fear and grievously too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1365,3699-175950-0003,you must mean your uncle's replied my great grandmother my great grandfather was convinced he untwisted the paper and signed the article,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1366,3699-175950-0004,so that my father had the jointure to pay a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly on michaelmas and lady day during all that time no man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1368,3699-175950-0006,inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his wig look'd at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1370,3699-175950-0008,so that the whimsicality of my father's brain was far from having the whole honour of this as it had of almost all his other strange notions for in a great measure he might be said to have suck'd this in with his mother's milk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1371,3699-175950-0009,that he did not conceive how the greatest family in england could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses and for the contrary reason he would generally add,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1372,3699-175950-0010,that it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life where the same number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct line,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1373,3699-175950-0011,i mean the external organ of smelling or that part of man which stands prominent in his face and which painters say in good jolly noses and well proportioned faces should comprehend a full third that is measured downwards from the setting on of the hair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1374,3699-175950-0012,did he read such books and observe such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him change sides now my father as i told you last year detested all this he pick'd up an opinion sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1380,3699-175950-0018,they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting as in the case above so that they might well and truly be said to be of his own goods and chattels accordingly he held fast by em both by teeth and claws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1381,3699-175950-0019,would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on and in a word would intrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breast works as my uncle toby would a citadel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1382,3699-175950-0020,by the trotting of my lean horse the thing is incredible and i am quite lost in my understanding when i am considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon worse subjects,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1383,3699-175950-0021,what was to be had however he set the greater store by and though my father would oft times sport with my uncle toby's library which by the bye was ridiculous enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1384,3699-175950-0022,but that was not thy transgression my dear uncle here but why here rather than in any other part of my story i am not able to tell but here it is my heart stops me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1386,3699-175950-0024,devouredst no man's bread gently with faithful trim behind thee didst thou amble round the little circle of thy pleasures jostling no creature in thy way for each one's sorrows thou hadst a tear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1388,3699-19401-0000,my father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations thrusting and ripping and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1389,3699-19401-0001,for that the taylor in ripping them up in order to turn them had found they had been turn'd before then turn them again brother said my father rapidly for there will be many a turning of em yet before all's done in the affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1390,3699-19401-0002,they are as rotten as dirt said the corporal then by all means said my father bespeak a new pair brother for though i know continued my father turning himself to the company,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1391,3699-19401-0003,that widow wadman has been deeply in love with my brother toby for many years and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion yet now that she has caught him her fever will be pass'd its height,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1393,3699-19401-0005,the hypothesis like the rest of my father's was plausible enough and my uncle toby had but a single word to object to it in which trim stood ready to second him but my father had not drawn his conclusion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1394,3699-19401-0006,for this reason continued my father stating the case over again notwithstanding all the world knows that missus wadman affects my brother toby and my brother toby contrariwise affects missus wadman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1396,3699-19401-0008,we have taken our measures badly quoth my uncle toby looking up interrogatively in trim's face i would lay my montero cap said trim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1397,3699-19401-0009,now trim's montero cap as i once told you was his constant wager and having furbish'd it up that very night in order to go upon the attack it made the odds look more considerable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1401,3699-19401-0013,and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter skelter upon the whole order of nuns and beguines a set of silly fusty baggages slop could not stand it and my uncle toby having some measures to take about his breeches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1404,3699-19401-0016,though i perceive from a glow in my cheek that i blush as i begin to speak to thee upon the subject as well knowing notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy how few of its offices thou neglectest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1405,3699-19401-0017,yet i would remind thee of one during the continuance of thy courtship in a particular manner which i would not have omitted and that is never to go forth upon the enterprize whether it be in the morning or the afternoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1407,3699-19401-0019,once at least every four or five days but oftner if convenient lest in taking off thy wig before her thro absence of mind she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by time how much by trim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1408,3699-19401-0020,whatever thou hast to say be it more or less forget not to utter it in a low soft tone of voice silence and whatever approaches it weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1409,3699-19401-0021,for this cause if thou canst help it never throw down the tongs and poker avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1410,3699-19401-0022,they are all books which excite laughter and thou knowest dear toby that there is no passion so serious as lust stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou enterest her parlour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1411,3699-19401-0023,there is nothing further for thee which occurs to me at present unless the breaking out of a fresh war so wishing every thing dear toby for best i rest thy affectionate brother walter shandy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1412,3699-19401-0024,whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions my uncle toby and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack as the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside at least for the present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1413,3699-19401-0025,there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning so accordingly it was resolv'd upon for eleven o'clock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1414,3699-19401-0026,but the account of this is worth more than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth alluding to the first edition volume of such a work as this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1415,3699-47246-0000,chapter four i am by no means sure that if the good people of milby had known the truth about the countess czerlaski they would not have been considerably disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1416,3699-47246-0001,nice distinctions are troublesome it is so much easier to say that a thing is black than to discriminate the particular shade of brown blue or green to which it really belongs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1417,3699-47246-0002,besides think of all the virtuous declamation all the penetrating observation which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position that the countess was a very objectionable person indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1418,3699-47246-0003,and which would be utterly overturned and nullified by the destruction of that premiss missus phipps the banker's wife and missus landor the attorney's wife had invested part of their reputation for acuteness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1419,3699-47246-0004,had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the other lady's manifest superiority in personal charms miss phipps's stumpy figure and unsuccessful attire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1420,3699-47246-0005,instead of looking down from a mount of virtue with an aureole round its head would then be seen on the same level and in the same light as the countess czerlaski's diana like form and well chosen drapery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1421,3699-47246-0006,miss phipps for her part didn't like dressing for effect she had always avoided that style of appearance which was calculated to create a sensation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1422,3699-47246-0007,then what amusing innuendoes of the milby gentlemen over their wine would have been entirely frustrated and reduced to nought if you had told them that the countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanours which demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1423,3699-47246-0008,had subsequently given dancing lessons in the metropolis that mister bridmain was neither more nor less than her half brother who by unimpeached integrity and industry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1424,3699-47246-0009,had won a partnership in a silk manufactory and thereby a moderate fortune that enabled him to retire as you see to study politics the weather and the art of conversation at his leisure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1425,3699-47246-0010,mister bridmain in fact quadragenarian bachelor as he was felt extremely well pleased to receive his sister in her widowhood and to shine in the reflected light of her beauty and title,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1426,3699-47246-0011,every man who is not a monster a mathematician or a mad philosopher is the slave of some woman or other mister bridmain had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister and though his soul was a very little one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1427,3699-47246-0012,of the smallest description indeed he would not have ventured to call it his own he might be slightly recalcitrant now and then as is the habit of long eared pachyderms under the thong of the fair countess's tongue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1428,3699-47246-0013,and there was always the possibility that mister bridmain's first nuptials might occur before the countess was quite sure of her second as it was however he submitted to all his sister's caprices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1429,3699-47246-0014,as personages on the debatable ground between aristocracy and commonalty instead of settling in some spot where his five hundred a year might have won him the definite dignity of a parochial magnate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1430,3699-47246-0015,whom he initiated into the mysteries of the pas de bas and the lancers quadrilles she had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with czerlaski who had taken her to paris and germany,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1431,3699-47246-0016,not indeed any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom but much external polish and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1432,3699-47246-0017,one of these conclusions was that there were things more solid in life than fine whiskers and a title and that in accepting a second husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1433,3699-47246-0018,was difficult to be met with at watering places which were already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauties and were chiefly stocked with men whose whiskers might be dyed and whose incomes were still more problematic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1434,3699-47246-0019,so she had determined on trying a neighbourhood where people were extremely well acquainted with each other's affairs and where the women were mostly ill dressed and ugly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1435,3699-47246-0020,and give him at least a sort of cousinship to the quarter sessions all this which was the simple truth would have seemed extremely flat to the gossips of milby who had made up their minds to something much more exciting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1436,3699-47246-0021,there was nothing here so very detestable it is true the countess was a little vain a little ambitious a little selfish a little shallow and frivolous a little given to white lies but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1437,3699-47246-0022,who considers such slight blemishes such moral pimples as these disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1438,3699-47246-0023,the severest ladies in milby would have been perfectly aware that these characteristics would have created no wide distinction between the countess czerlaski and themselves and since it was clear there was a wide distinction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1439,3699-47246-0024,why it must lie in the possession of some vices from which they were undeniably free hence it came to pass that milby respectability refused to recognize the countess czerlaski,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1440,3699-47246-0025,in spite of her assiduous church going and the deep disgust she was known to have expressed at the extreme paucity of the congregations on ash wednesdays,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1441,3699-47246-0026,so she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighbourhood where people are well acquainted with each other's private affairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1442,3699-47246-0027,and shuns a coldly satirical eye as she would shun a gorgon and she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship not merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1443,3699-47246-0028,and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that quarter she had serious intentions of becoming quite pious without any reserves when she had once got her carriage and settlement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1444,3699-47246-0029,the countess did not quote sophocles but she said to herself only this little bit of pretence and vanity and then i will be quite good and make myself quite safe for another world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1445,3699-47246-0030,for you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the countess was absorbingly devoted and to whose desires she made everything else subservient namely caroline czerlaski nee bridmain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1446,3699-47246-0031,thus there was really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and attentions to mister and missus barton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1447,3699-47246-0032,still their friendship by no means adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to milby and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1448,229-130880-0000,right off i observed a cluster of mountains about two thousand feet high whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted after our position fix i reentered the lounge and when our bearings were reported on the chart i saw that we were off the island of ceylon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1449,229-130880-0001,that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula i went looking in the library for a book about this island one of the most fertile in the world sure enough i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1450,229-130880-0002,reentering the lounge i first noted the bearings of ceylon on which antiquity lavished so many different names,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1451,229-130880-0003,its length is two hundred seventy five miles its maximum width one hundred fifty miles its circumference nine hundred miles its surface area twenty four thousand four hundred forty eight square miles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1452,229-130880-0004,in other words a little smaller than that of ireland just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared the captain glanced at the chart then turning to me the island of ceylon he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1453,229-130880-0005,is famous for its pearl fisheries would you be interested professor aronnax,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1454,229-130880-0006,certainly captain fine it's easily done only when we see the fisheries we'll see no fishermen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1455,229-130880-0007,and we'll arrive there late tonight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1456,229-130880-0008,who went out immediately soon the nautilus reentered its liquid element and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet with the chart under my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1457,229-130880-0009,i found it by the ninth parallel off the northwestern shores of ceylon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1458,229-130880-0010,to reach it we had to go all the way up ceylon's west coast professor captain nemo then told me there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal the seas of the east indies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1459,229-130880-0011,the seas of china and japan plus those seas south of the united states the gulf of panama and the gulf of california but it's off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards no doubt we'll be arriving a little early,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1460,229-130880-0012,only during the month of march and for thirty days some three hundred boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen the latter divide into two groups,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1461,229-130880-0013,dive in rotation and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat you mean i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1462,229-130880-0014,that such primitive methods are still all that they use all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1463,229-130880-0015,although these fisheries belong to the most industrialized people in the world the english,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1464,229-130880-0016,yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work yes since those poor fishermen can't stay long underwater on his voyage to ceylon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1465,229-130880-0017,the englishman percival made much of a kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface but i find that hard to believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1466,229-130880-0018,i know that some divers can last up to fifty seven seconds and highly skillful ones to eighty seven but such men are rare,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1467,229-130880-0019,i believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1468,229-130880-0020,their vision weakens ulcers break out on their eyes sores form on their bodies and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor yes i said it's a sad occupation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1469,229-130880-0021,and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion but tell me captain how many oysters can a boat fish up in a workday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1470,229-130880-0022,it's even said that in eighteen fourteen when the english government went fishing on its own behalf its divers worked just twenty days and brought up seventy six million oysters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1471,229-130880-0023,the fishermen are well paid aren't they hardly professor in panama they make just one dollar per week in most places they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl and they bring up so many that have none,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1472,229-130880-0024,only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich that's atrocious on that note professor captain nemo told me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1473,229-130880-0025,and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early well we can watch him at work that suits me captain by the way professor aronnax you aren't afraid of sharks are you sharks i exclaimed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1474,229-130880-0026,this struck me as a pretty needless question to say the least well captain nemo went on i admit captain i'm not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish we're used to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1475,229-130880-0027,the rest of us captain nemo answered and in time you will be too anyhow we'll be armed and on our way we might hunt a man eater or two it's a fascinating sport so professor i'll see you tomorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1476,229-130880-0028,bright and early this said in a carefree tone captain nemo left the lounge if you're invited to hunt bears in the swiss mountains you might say oh good i get to go bear hunting tomorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1477,229-130880-0029,if you're invited to hunt lions on the atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of india you might say ha now's my chance to hunt lions and tigers but if you're invited to hunt sharks in their native element,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1478,229-130880-0030,you might want to think it over before accepting as for me i passed a hand over my brow where beads of cold sweat were busy forming let's think this over i said to myself and let's take our time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1479,229-130880-0031,hunting otters in underwater forests as we did in the forests of crespo island is an acceptable activity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1480,229-130880-0032,that's another story i know that in certain countries particularly the andaman islands negroes don't hesitate to attack sharks dagger in one hand and noose in the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1481,229-130880-0033,but i also know that many who face those fearsome animals don't come back alive besides i'm not a negro and even if i were a negro in this instance i don't think a little hesitation on my part would be out of place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1482,229-130880-0034,and there i was fantasizing about sharks envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half i could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1483,229-130880-0035,and how i resented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1484,229-130880-0036,thank heavens i said to myself conseil will never want to come along and that'll be my excuse for not going with the captain as for ned land i admit i felt less confident of his wisdom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1485,229-130880-0037,danger however great held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature i went back to reading sirr's book but i leafed through it mechanically between the lines i kept seeing fearsome wide open jaws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1486,229-130880-0038,just then conseil and the canadian entered with a calm even gleeful air little did they know what was waiting for them ye gods sir ned land told me your captain nemo the devil take him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1487,229-130880-0039,has just made us a very pleasant proposition oh i said you know about with all due respect to master conseil replied the nautilus's commander has invited us together with master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1488,229-130880-0040,for a visit tomorrow to ceylon's magnificent pearl fisheries he did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman he didn't tell you anything else nothing sir the canadian replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1489,229-130880-0041,he said you'd already discussed this little stroll indeed i said but didn't he give you any details on not a one mister naturalist you will be going with us right me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1490,229-130880-0042,why yes certainly of course i can see that you like the idea mister land yes it will be a really unusual experience and possibly dangerous i added in an insinuating tone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1491,229-130880-0043,dangerous ned land replied a simple trip to an oysterbank assuredly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1492,229-130880-0044,for my part i stared at them with anxious eyes as if they were already missing a limb or two should i alert them yes surely but i hardly knew how to go about it would master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1493,229-130880-0045,conseil said to me give us some background on pearl fishing on the fishing itself i asked or on the occupational hazards that on the fishing the canadian replied before we tackle the terrain it helps to be familiar with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1494,229-130880-0046,all right sit down my friends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1495,229-130880-0047,ned and conseil took seats on a couch and right off the canadian said to me sir just what is a pearl exactly my gallant ned i replied for poets a pearl is a tear from the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1496,229-130880-0048,for orientals it's a drop of solidified dew for the ladies it's a jewel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1497,229-130880-0049,necks and ears that's oblong in shape glassy in luster and formed from mother of pearl for chemists it's a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protein,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1498,229-130880-0050,and finally for naturalists it's a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother of pearl in certain bivalves branch mollusca conseil said class,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1499,229-130880-0051,acephala order testacea correct my scholarly conseil now then those testacea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abalone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1500,229-130880-0052,turbo snails giant clams and saltwater scallops briefly all those that secrete mother of pearl in other words that blue azure violet or white substance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1501,229-130880-0053,lining the insides of their valves are mussels included too the canadian asked yes the mussels of certain streams in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1502,229-130880-0054,good the canadian replied from now on we'll pay closer attention to em but i went on for secreting pearls the ideal mollusk is the pearl oyster meleagrina margaritifera,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1503,229-130880-0055,that valuable shellfish pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape either they stick to the oyster's shell or they become embedded in the creature's folds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1504,229-130880-0056,on the valves a pearl sticks fast on the flesh it lies loose but its nucleus is always some small hard object say a sterile egg or a grain of sand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1505,229-130880-0057,around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin concentric layers over several years in succession can one find several pearls in the same oyster conseil asked yes my boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1506,229-130880-0058,they even mention one oyster about which i remain dubious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1507,229-130880-0059,ned land yelped did i say sharks i exclaimed hastily i meant one hundred fifty pearls sharks wouldn't make sense indeed conseil said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1508,229-130880-0060,but will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls one proceeds in several ways and often when pearls stick to the valves fishermen even pull them loose with pliers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1509,229-130880-0061,thus they die in the open air and by the end of ten days they've rotted sufficiently next they're immersed in huge tanks of salt water then they're opened up and washed at this point the sorters begin their twofold task,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1510,229-130880-0062,first they remove the layers of mother of pearl which are known in the industry by the names legitimate silver bastard white or bastard black,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1511,229-130880-0063,then they remove the oyster's meaty tissue boil it and finally strain it in order to extract even the smallest pearls do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size conseil asked not only on their size i replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1512,229-130880-0064,but also according to their shape their water in other words their color and their orient in other words that dappled shimmering glow that makes them so delightful to the eye the finest pearls are called virgin pearls or paragons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1513,229-130880-0065,they form in isolation within the mollusk's tissue they're white often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency and usually spherical or pear shaped the spherical ones are made into bracelets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1514,229-130880-0066,the pear shaped ones into earrings and since they're the most valuable they're priced individually the other pearls that stick to the oyster's shell are more erratically shaped and are priced by weight finally classed in the lowest order,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1515,229-130880-0067,the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls they're priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments but it must be a long hard job sorting out these pearls by size,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1516,229-130880-0068,the canadian said no my friend that task is performed with eleven strainers or sieves that are pierced with different numbers of holes those pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first order,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1517,229-130880-0069,those not slipping through the sieves pierced with one hundred to eight hundred holes are in the second order finally those pearls for which one uses strainers pierced with nine hundred to one thousand holes make up the seed pearls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1518,229-130880-0070,how ingenious conseil said to reduce dividing and classifying pearls to a mechanical operation and could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters according to sirr's book i replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1519,229-130880-0071,these ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of three million man eaters francs conseil rebuked yes francs three million francs i went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1520,229-130880-0072,but i don't think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did similarly the central american fisheries,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1521,229-130880-0073,but now they bring in only two thirds of that amount all in all it's estimated that nine million francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl harvesting industry but conseil asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1522,229-130880-0074,haven't certain famous pearls been quoted at extremely high prices yes my boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1523,229-130880-0075,i've even heard stories the canadian said about some lady in ancient times who drank pearls in vinegar cleopatra conseil shot back it must have tasted pretty bad ned land added abominable ned my friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1524,229-130880-0076,conseil replied but when a little glass of vinegar is worth one million five hundred thousand francs its taste is a small price to pay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1525,229-130880-0077,ned land married to cleopatra conseil exclaimed but i was all set to tie the knot conseil the canadian replied in all seriousness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1526,229-130880-0078,i even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancee kate tender but she married somebody else instead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1527,229-130880-0079,but you can absolutely trust me on this professor its pearls were so big,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1528,229-130880-0080,my gallant ned i replied laughing those were artificial pearls ordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with essence of orient wow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1529,229-130880-0081,that essence of orient must sell for quite a large sum as little as zero it comes from the scales of a european carp it's nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia it's worthless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1530,229-130880-0082,maybe that's why kate tender married somebody else replied mister land philosophically but i said getting back to pearls of great value i don't think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by captain nemo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1531,229-130880-0083,this one conseil said pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case exactly and i'm certainly not far off when i estimate its value at two million uh francs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1532,229-130880-0084,conseil said quickly yes i said two million francs and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up ha ned land exclaimed during our stroll tomorrow who says we won't run into one just like it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1534,229-130880-0086,shaking his head in fact i said mister land is right and if we ever brought back to europe or america a pearl worth millions it would make the story of our adventures more authentic and much more rewarding that's how i see it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1535,229-130880-0087,the canadian said but said conseil who perpetually returned to the didactic side of things is this pearl fishing ever dangerous no i replied quickly especially if one takes certain precautions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1536,229-130880-0088,what risks would you run in a job like that ned land said swallowing a few gulps of salt water whatever you say ned then trying to imitate captain nemo's carefree tone i asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1537,229-130880-0089,by the way gallant ned are you afraid of sharks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1538,229-130880-0090,the canadian replied i'm a professional harpooner it's my job to make a mockery of them it isn't an issue i said of fishing for them with a swivel hook hoisting them onto the deck of a ship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1539,229-130880-0091,opening the belly ripping out the heart and tossing it into the sea so it's an issue of yes precisely in the water in the water ye gods just give me a good harpoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1540,229-130880-0092,you see sir these sharks are badly designed they have to roll their bellies over to snap you up and in the meantime ned land had a way of pronouncing the word snap,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1541,229-130880-0093,well how about you conseil what are your feelings about these man eaters me conseil said i'm afraid i must be frank with master good for you i thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1542,60-121082-0000,the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced on his wife's request m de villefort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1543,60-121082-0001,was the first to give the signal of departure he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1544,60-121082-0002,as for m danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1545,60-121082-0003,he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1546,60-121082-0004,without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel chateau renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m de villefort's carriage danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1547,60-121082-0005,had offered him a seat in his carriage andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1548,60-121082-0006,was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1549,60-121082-0007,amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king's attorney then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1550,60-121082-0008,and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1551,60-121082-0009,he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major's little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1552,60-121082-0010,then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his forty eight thousand francs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1553,60-121082-0011,were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker's servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon one thing above all the rest heightened the respect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1554,60-121082-0012,nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1555,60-121082-0013,by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught then he had eaten some without saying a word more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1556,60-121082-0014,danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1557,60-121082-0015,by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1558,60-121082-0016,to morrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1559,60-121082-0017,if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1560,60-121082-0018,and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1561,60-121082-0019,who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son sixty thousand francs a year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1562,60-121082-0020,as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1563,60-121082-0021,giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1564,60-121082-0022,who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step at that moment a hand touched his shoulder the young man turned round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1565,60-121082-0023,and had returned just as they were starting but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1566,60-121082-0024,and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf's or jackal's a red handkerchief encircled his gray head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1567,60-121082-0025,torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man's shoulder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1568,60-121082-0026,and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1569,60-121082-0027,or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1570,60-121082-0028,he asked pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you you have no right to beg at night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1571,60-121082-0029,said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1572,60-121082-0030,i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1573,60-121082-0031,speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1574,60-121082-0032,i can scarcely stand the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity tell me he said tell me what you want well then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1575,60-121082-0033,i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back andrea turned pale but said nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1576,60-121082-0034,yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1577,60-121082-0035,at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1578,60-121082-0036,there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea oh as for that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1579,60-121082-0037,i'll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horse's bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for any one to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1581,60-121082-0039,come step in said the young man it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1582,60-121082-0040,andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1583,60-121082-0041,andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1585,60-121082-0043,but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1586,60-121082-0044,you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1642,1578-6379-0003,as they came to a stop they were besieged by a crowd of blue coated girls it was afternoon recreation and the whole school was abroad the welcome that she received would have led an onlooker to infer that patty had been gone three months instead of three days she and her two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1647,1578-6379-0008,miss jellings was insistent that recreation should be actively pursued out of doors the two could easily have obtained permission to greet patty's return inside but it was the policy of the trio never to ask permission in minor matters it wasted one's credit unnecessarily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1672,1578-6379-0033,before patty resumed her chronicle and uncle tom made me tell about the suit case at the dinner table everybody laughed it made a very exciting story i told them about the whole school going to the glee club and falling in love in a body with the third man from the end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1673,1578-6379-0034,and how we all cut his picture out of the program and pasted it in our watches and then about my sitting across from him in the train and changing suit cases mister harper the man next to me said it was the most romantic thing he'd ever heard in his life that louise's marriage was nothing to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1676,1578-6379-0037,and she hoped he was a gentleman and would take it nicely she telephoned to the baggage man that it was here but she couldn't send martin with it this afternoon because he had to go to the farm for some eggs recreation was over and the girls came trooping in to gather books and pads and pencils for the approaching study hour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1685,1578-6379-0046,while the others in a flutter of excitement thrust in the coat and relocked the suit case they crowded after her in a body and hung over the banisters at a perilous angle straining their ears in the direction of the drawing room nothing but a murmur of voices floated up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1686,1578-6379-0047,punctuated by an occasional deep bass laugh when they heard the front door close with one accord they invaded harriet gladden's room which commanded the walk and pressed their noses against the pane a short thick set man of german build was waddling toward the gate and the trolley car,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1687,1578-6379-0048,they gazed with wide horrified eyes and turned without a word to meet patty as she trudged upstairs lugging her errant suit case a glance told her that they had seen and dropping on the top step she leaned her head against the railing and laughed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1692,1578-140049-0004,what have you got in the pocket of that new dress that makes it sag down so it's my nuts and raisins from dinner replied rebecca who never succeeded in keeping the most innocent action a secret from her aunt miranda they're just what you gave me on my plate why didn't you eat them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1693,1578-140049-0005,they were your own rebecca interposed aunt jane and if you chose to save them to give away it is all right we ought never to let this day pass without giving our neighbors something to be thankful for instead of taking all the time to think of our own mercies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1694,1578-140049-0006,the burnham sisters nodded approvingly as rebecca went out and remarked that they had never seen a child grow and improve so fast in so short a time there's plenty of room left for more improvement as you'd know if she lived in the same house with you answered miranda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1697,1578-140049-0009,this time it was a full set of furs for missus ladd and to think we can remember the time he was a barefoot boy without two shirts to his back it is strange he hasn't married with all his money and him so fond of children that he always has a pack of them at his heels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1698,1578-140049-0010,there's hope for him still though said miss jane smilingly for i don't s'pose he's more than thirty he could get a wife in riverboro if he was a hundred and thirty remarked miss miranda adam's aunt says he was so taken with the little girl that sold the soap clara belle did you say her name was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1699,1578-140049-0011,that he declared he was going to bring her a christmas present continued miss ellen well there's no accountin for tastes exclaimed miss miranda clara belle's got cross eyes and red hair but i'd be the last one to grudge her a christmas present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1700,1578-140049-0012,for this one couldn't have been cross eyed i remember missus ladd saying adam remarked about this child's handsome eyes he said it was her eyes that made him buy the three hundred cakes missus ladd has it stacked up in the shed chamber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1702,1578-140049-0014,and changed the subject much to jane's gratitude for she had been nervous and ill at ease for the last fifteen minutes what child in riverboro could be described as remarkable and winning save rebecca what child had wonderful eyes except the same rebecca,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1703,1578-140049-0015,and finally was there ever a child in the world who could make a man buy soap by the hundred cakes save rebecca meantime the remarkable child had flown up the road in the deepening dusk but she had not gone far before she heard the sound of hurrying footsteps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1704,1578-140049-0016,and saw a well known figure coming in her direction in a moment she and emma jane met and exchanged a breathless embrace something awful has happened panted emma jane don't tell me it's broken exclaimed rebecca no oh no not that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1706,1578-140049-0018,but what's the trouble the simpsons have no kerosene and no wicks i guess they thought a banquet lamp was something that lighted itself and burned without any help seesaw has gone to the doctor's to try if he can borrow a wick and mother let me have a pint of oil but she says she won't give me any more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1707,1578-140049-0019,we never thought of the expense of keeping up the lamp rebecca no we didn't but let's not worry about that till after the party i have a handful of nuts and raisins and some apples i have peppermints and maple sugar said emma jane they had a real thanksgiving dinner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1710,1578-140049-0022,on it stood the sacred the adored the long desired object almost as beautiful and nearly half as large as the advertisement the brass glistened like gold and the crimson paper shade glowed like a giant ruby,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1711,1578-140049-0023,in the wide splash of light that it flung upon the floor sat the simpsons in reverent and solemn silence emma jane standing behind them hand in hand with rebecca there seemed to be no desire for conversation the occasion was too thrilling and serious for that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1712,1578-140049-0024,the lamp it was tacitly felt by everybody was dignifying the party and providing sufficient entertainment simply by its presence being fully as satisfactory in its way as a pianola or a string band i wish father could see it said clara belle loyally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1715,1578-140049-0027,mister tubbs brought it over from north riverboro and said somebody sent an order by mail for it rebecca squeezed emma jane's arm and emma jane gave a rapturous return squeeze,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1716,1578-140049-0028,it was mister aladdin whispered rebecca as they ran down the path to the gate seesaw followed them and handsomely offered to see them apiece down the road but rebecca declined his escort with such decision that he did not press the matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1717,1578-140049-0029,but went to bed to dream of her instead in his dreams flashes of lightning proceeded from both her eyes and she held a flaming sword in either hand rebecca entered the home dining room joyously the burnham sisters had gone and the two aunts were knitting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1718,1578-140049-0030,it was a heavenly party she cried taking off her hat and cape go back and see if you have shut the door tight and then lock it said miss miranda in her usual austere manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1719,1578-140049-0031,and oh aunt jane aunt miranda if you'll only come into the kitchen and look out of the sink window you can see the banquet lamp shining all red just as if the simpsons house was on fire and probably it will be before long observed miranda i've got no patience with such foolish goin's on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1720,1578-140049-0032,jane accompanied rebecca into the kitchen although the feeble glimmer which she was able to see from that distance did not seem to her a dazzling exhibition she tried to be as enthusiastic as possible rebecca who was it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1721,1578-140049-0033,that sold the three hundred cakes of soap to mister ladd in north riverboro mister who exclaimed rebecca mister ladd in north riverboro is that his real name queried rebecca in astonishment i didn't make a bad guess and she laughed softly to herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1722,1578-140049-0034,i asked you who sold the soap to adam ladd resumed miss jane adam ladd then he's a ladd too what fun answer me rebecca oh excuse me aunt jane i was so busy thinking emma jane and i sold the soap to mister ladd,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1723,1578-140049-0035,he needed the soap dreadfully as a present for his aunt miss jane still looked a little unconvinced though she only said i hope your aunt miranda won't mind but you know how particular she is rebecca and i really wish you wouldn't do anything out of the ordinary without asking her first for your actions are very queer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1724,1578-140049-0036,there can't be anything wrong this time rebecca answered confidently emma jane sold her cakes to her own relations and to uncle jerry cobb and i went first to those new tenements near the lumber mill and then to the ladds mister ladd bought all we had and made us promise to keep the secret until the premium came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1725,1578-140049-0037,rebecca's hair was loosened and falling over her forehead in ruffled waves her eyes were brilliant her cheeks crimson there was a hint of everything in the girl's face of sensitiveness and delicacy as well as of ardor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1726,1578-140049-0038,there was the sweetness of the mayflower and the strength of the young oak but one could easily divine that she was one of the souls by nature pitched too high by suffering plunged too low,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1727,1578-140045-0000,the stirring of the powers rebecca's visit to milltown was all that her glowing fancy had painted it except that recent readings about rome and venice disposed her to believe that those cities might have an advantage over milltown,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1728,1578-140045-0001,in the matter of mere pictorial beauty so soon does the soul outgrow its mansions that after once seeing milltown her fancy ran out to the future sight of portland for that having islands and a harbor and two public monuments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1729,1578-140045-0002,must be far more beautiful than milltown which would she felt take its proud place among the cities of the earth by reason of its tremendous business activity rather than by any irresistible appeal to the imagination,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1730,1578-140045-0003,i tell you harriet beecher stowe herself couldn't a done it better justice i took it all in responded mister cobb who was pleased that mother agreed with him about rebecca i ain't sure but she's goin to turn out somethin remarkable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1731,1578-140045-0004,land no mother there ain't no home'path bout miss parks she drives all over the country i can't see rebecca as a lady doctor somehow mused missus cobb her gift o gab is what's goin to be the makin of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1732,1578-140045-0005,or recite pieces like that portland elocutionist that come out here to the harvest supper i guess she'll be able to write down her own pieces said mister cobb confidently she could make em up faster n she could read em out of a book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1733,1578-140045-0006,rebecca made a poor hand at composition writing at this time miss dearborn gave her every sort of subject that she had ever been given herself cloud pictures abraham lincoln nature philanthropy slavery intemperance joy and duty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1734,1578-140045-0007,solitude but with none of them did rebecca seem to grapple satisfactorily write as you talk rebecca insisted poor miss dearborn who secretly knew that she could never manage a good composition herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1735,1578-140045-0008,now in your last one on solitude you haven't said anything very interesting and you've made it too common and every day to sound well there are too many yous and yours in it you ought to say one now and then to make it seem more like good writing one opens a favorite book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1736,1578-140045-0009,one's thoughts are a great comfort in solitude and so on i don't know any more about solitude this week than i did about joy and duty last week grumbled rebecca you tried to be funny about joy and duty said miss dearborn reprovingly so of course you didn't succeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1737,1578-140045-0010,of recollection joy and duty had been the inspiring subject given to the older children for a theme to be written in five minutes rebecca had wrestled struggled perspired in vain when her turn came to read,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1738,1578-140045-0011,she was obliged to confess she had written nothing you have at least two lines rebecca insisted the teacher for i see them on your slate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1739,1578-140045-0012,read what you have good or bad little or much i am excusing nobody rebecca rose overcome with secret laughter dread and mortification then in a low voice she read the couplet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1740,1578-140045-0013,and the training of the young idea seldom appealed to the sense of humor you must stay after school and try again rebecca she said but she said it smilingly your poetry hasn't a very nice idea in it for a good little girl who ought to love duty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1741,1578-140045-0014,it wasn't my idea said rebecca apologetically i had only made the first line when i saw you were going to ring the bell and say the time was up i had clash written and i couldn't think of anything then but hash or rash or smash i'll change it to this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1742,1578-140045-0015,having been instructed in the use of the indefinite pronoun one as giving a refined and elegant touch to literary efforts rebecca painstakingly rewrote her composition on solitude giving it all the benefit of miss dearborn's suggestion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1743,1578-140045-0016,it then appeared in the following form which hardly satisfied either teacher or pupil solitude it would be false to say that one could ever be alone when one has one's lovely thoughts to comfort one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1744,1578-140045-0017,one sits by one's self it is true but one thinks one opens one's favorite book and reads one's favorite story one speaks to one's aunt or one's brother fondles one's cat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1745,1578-140045-0018,does one ever feel bereft when one picks up one's chips to light one's fire for one's evening meal or when one washes one's milk pail before milking one's cow one would fancy not r r r,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1746,1578-140045-0019,don't you think calling supper one's evening meal is pretty and isn't bereft a nice word yes that part of it does very well it is the cat the chips and the milk pail that i don't like,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1747,1578-140045-0020,yes i don't like a cow in a composition said the difficult miss dearborn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1748,1578-140045-0021,for the next week minnie smellie's mother told miranda sawyer that she'd better look after rebecca for she was given to swearing and profane language that she had been heard saying something dreadful that very afternoon saying it before emma jane and living perkins who only laughed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1749,1578-140045-0022,don't be ugly and obstinate but think real hard when did they chase you up the road and what were you doing a sudden light broke upon rebecca's darkness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1750,1578-140045-0023,emma jane living and i were walking along and i was ahead i saw the water streaming over the road towards the ditch and it reminded me of uncle tom's cabin at milltown when eliza took her baby and ran across the mississippi on the ice blocks pursued by the bloodhounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1751,1578-140045-0024,we couldn't keep from laughing after we came out of the tent because they were acting on such a small platform that eliza had to run round and round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1752,1578-140045-0025,and part of the time she had to pursue the dog i knew living would remember too so i took off my waterproof and wrapped it round my books for a baby,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1753,1578-140045-0026,just like that the same as eliza did in the play then i leaped from puddle to puddle and living and emma jane pursued me like the bloodhounds it's just like that stupid minnie smellie who doesn't know a game when she sees one and eliza wasn't swearing when she said my god the river,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1754,1578-140045-0027,it was more like praying well you've got no call to be prayin any more than swearin in the middle of the road said miranda but i'm thankful it's no worse you're born to trouble as the sparks fly upward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1755,1578-140045-0028,an i'm afraid you allers will be till you learn to bridle your unruly tongue i wish sometimes that i could bridle minnie's murmured rebecca as she went to set the table for supper i declare she is the beatin'est child said miranda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1756,1578-140045-0029,but whether it's for the better or the worse i can't hardly tell till she grows up she's got the making of most anything in her rebecca has but i feel sometimes as if we were not fitted to cope with her stuff an nonsense said miranda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1757,7264-92314-0000,i say that the few newspaper controllers govern and govern abominably i am right but they only do so as do all new powers by at once alliance with and treason against the old witness harmsworth and the politicians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1758,7264-92314-0001,this connection has developed in the great capitalist papers a certain character which can be best described by the term official under certain forms of arbitrary government in continental europe ministers once made use of picked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1759,7264-92314-0002,and rare newspapers to express their views and these newspapers came to be called the official press it was a crude method and has been long abandoned even by the simpler despotic forms of government nothing of that kind exists now of course in the deeper corruption of modern europe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1760,7264-92314-0003,least of all in england what has grown up here is a press organization of support and favour to the system of professional politics which colours the whole of our great capitalist papers to day in england this gives them so distinct a character of parliamentary falsehood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1761,7264-92314-0004,and that falsehood is so clearly dictated by their connection with executive power that they merit the title official the regime under which we are now living is that of a plutocracy which has gradually replaced the old aristocratic tradition of england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1762,7264-92314-0005,this plutocracy a few wealthy interests in part controls in part is expressed by is in part identical with the professional politicians and it has in the existing capitalist press an ally similar to that official press,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1763,7264-92314-0006,which continental nations knew in the past but there is this great difference that the official press of continental experiments never consisted in more than a few chosen organs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1764,7264-92314-0007,the character of which was well known and the attitude of which contrasted sharply with the rest but our official press for it is no less covers the whole field it has in the region of the great newspapers no competitor indeed it has no competitors at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1765,7264-92314-0008,if any one doubts that this adjective official can properly be applied to our capitalist press to day let him ask himself first what the forces are which govern the nation and next whether those forces that government or regime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1766,7264-92314-0009,could be better served even under a system of permanent censorship than it is in the great dailies of london and the principal provincial capitals is not everything which the regime desires to be suppressed suppressed is not everything which it desires suggested suggested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1767,7264-92314-0010,and is there any public question which would weaken the regime and the discussion of which is ever allowed to appear in the great capitalist journals there has not been such a case for at least twenty years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1768,7264-92314-0011,never deals with matters vital to its prestige on the contrary it deliberately side tracks any vital discussion that sincere conviction may have forced upon the public and spoils the scent with false issues,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1769,7264-92314-0012,one paper not a little while ago was clamouring against the excess of lawyers in government its remedy was an opposition to be headed by a lawyer another was very serious upon secret trading with the enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1770,7264-92314-0013,it suppressed for months all reference to the astounding instance of that misdemeanour by the connections of a very prominent professional politician early in the war and refused to comment on the single reference made to this crime in the house of commons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1771,7264-92314-0014,another clamours for the elimination of enemy financial power in the affairs of this country and yet says not a word upon the auditing of the secret party funds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1772,7264-92314-0015,i say that the big daily papers have now not only those other qualities dangerous to the state which i have described but that they have become essentially official that is insincere and corrupt in their interested support of that plutocratic complex which in the decay of aristocracy governs england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1773,7264-92314-0016,they are not independent where power is concerned they do not really criticize they serve a clique whom they should expose and denounce and betray the generality that is the state for whose sake the salaried public servants should be perpetually watched with suspicion and sharply kept in control,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1774,7264-92314-0017,the result is that the mass of englishmen have ceased to obtain or even to expect information upon the way they are governed they are beginning to feel a certain uneasiness they know that their old power of observation over public servants has slipped from them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1775,7264-92314-0018,they suspect that the known gross corruption of public life and particularly of the house of commons is entrenched behind a conspiracy of silence on the part of those very few who have the power to inform them but as yet they have not passed the stage of such suspicion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1776,7264-92314-0019,they have not advanced nearly as far as the discovery of the great newspaper owners and their system they are still for the most part duped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1777,7264-92314-0020,is a very great evil it warps and depletes public information it prevents the just criticism of public servants above all it gives immense and irresponsible power to a handful of wealthy men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1778,7264-92314-0021,and especially to the one most wealthy and unscrupulous among them whose wealth is an accident of speculation whose origins are repulsive and whose characters have as a rule the weakness and baseness developed by this sort of adventures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1779,7264-92314-0022,there are among such gutter snipes thousands whose luck ends in the native gutter half a dozen whose luck lands them into millions one or two at most who on the top of such a career go crazy with the ambition of the parvenu and propose to direct the state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1780,7264-92314-0023,even when gambling adventurers of this sort are known and responsible as they are in professional politics their power is a grave danger possessing as the newspaper owners do every power of concealment and at the same time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1781,7264-92314-0024,no shred of responsibility to any organ of the state they are a deadly peril the chief of these men are more powerful to day than any minister nay they do as i have said and it is now notorious make and unmake ministers and they may yet in our worst hour decide the national fate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1782,7264-92314-0025,now to every human evil of a political sort that has appeared in history to every evil that is affecting the state and proceeding from the will of man not from ungovernable natural forces outside man there comes a term and a reaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1783,7264-92314-0026,side by side with what i have called the official press in our top heavy plutocracy there has arisen a certain force for which i have a difficulty in finding a name but which i will call for lack of a better name the free press i might call it the independent press,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1784,7264-92314-0027,were it not that such a word would connote as yet a little too much power though i do believe its power to be rising and though i am confident that it will in the near future change our affairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1785,7264-92314-0028,i am not acquainted with any other modern language than french and english but i read this free press french and english colonial and american regularly and it seems to me the chief intellectual phenomenon of our time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1786,7264-92314-0029,in france and in england and for all i know elsewhere there has arisen in protest against the complete corruption and falsehood of the great capitalist papers a crop of new organs which are in the strictest sense of the word organs of opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1787,7264-92314-0030,the new age was i think the pioneer in the matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1788,7264-92314-0031,scotland one or two their number will increase with this i pass from the just denunciation of evil to the exposition of what is good,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1789,7264-92310-0000,let us halt at this phase in the development of the thing to consider certain other changes which were on the point of appearance and why they were on the point of appearance in the first place if advertisement had come to be the stand by of a newspaper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1790,7264-92310-0001,the capitalist owning the sheet would necessarily consider his revenue from advertisement before anything else he was indeed compelled to do so unless he had enormous revenues from other sources and ran his paper as a luxury costing a vast fortune a year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1791,7264-92310-0002,for in this industry the rule is either very great profits or very great and rapid losses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1792,7264-92310-0003,where a great daily paper is concerned he was compelled then to respect his advertisers as his paymasters to that extent therefore his power of giving true news and of printing sound opinion was limited even though his own inclinations should lean towards such news and such opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1793,7264-92310-0004,an individual newspaper owner might for instance have the greatest possible dislike for the trade in patent medicines he might object to the swindling of the poor which is the soul of that trade he might himself have suffered acute physical pain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1794,7264-92310-0005,but he certainly could not print an article against them nor even an article describing how they were made without losing a great part of his income directly and perhaps indirectly the whole of it from the annoyance caused to other advertisers who would note his independence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1795,7264-92310-0006,and fear friction in their own case he would prefer to retain his income persuade his readers to buy poison and remain free personally from touching the stuff he recommended for pay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1796,7264-92310-0007,the proprietor was always at the choice of publishing matter which did not affect him and saving his fortune or refusing it and jeopardizing his fortune he chose the former course in the second place there was an even more serious development advertisement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1797,7264-92310-0008,having become the stand by of the newspaper the large advertiser,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1798,7264-92310-0009,could not but regard his giving of an advertisement as something of a favour there is always this psychological or if you will artistic element in exchange in pure economics exchange is exactly balanced by the respective advantages of the exchangers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1799,7264-92310-0010,just as in pure dynamics you have the parallelogram of forces in the immense complexity of the real world material friction and a million other things affect the ideal parallelogram of forces and in economics other conscious passions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1800,7264-92310-0011,besides those of mere avarice affect exchange there are a million half conscious and sub conscious motives at work as well the large advertiser still mainly paid for advertisement according to circulation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1801,7264-92310-0012,he would not advertise in papers which he thought might by their publication of opinion ultimately hurt capitalism as a whole still less in those whose opinions might affect his own private fortune adversely stupid like all people given up to gain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1802,7264-92310-0013,he was muddle headed about the distinction between a large circulation and a circulation small but appealing to the rich he would refuse advertisements of luxuries to a paper read by half the wealthier class if he had heard in the national liberal club,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1803,7264-92310-0014,or some such place that the paper was in bad taste not only was there this negative power in the hands of the advertiser that of refusing the favour or patronage of his advertisements there was also a positive one though that only grew up later,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1804,7264-92310-0015,the advertiser came to see that he could actually dictate policy and opinion and that he had also another most powerful and novel weapon in his hand which was the suppression of news,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1805,7264-92310-0016,we must not exaggerate this element for one thing the power represented by the great capitalist press was a power equal with that of the great advertisers for another there was no clear cut distinction between the capitalism that owned newspapers and the capitalism that advertised,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1806,7264-92310-0017,the same man who owned the daily times was a shareholder in jones's soap or smith's pills the man who gambled and lost on the howl was at the same time gambling and winning on a bucket shop advertised in the howl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1807,7264-92310-0018,there was no antagonism of class interest one against the other and what was more they were of the same kind and breed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1808,7264-92310-0019,was exactly the same kind of man as he who bought a peerage out of a combine in music halls or cut his throat when his bluff in indian silver was called the type is the common modern type parliament is full of it and it runs newspapers only as one of its activities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1809,7264-92310-0020,all of which need the suggestion of advertisement the newspaper owner and the advertiser then were intermixed but on the balance the advertising interest being wider spread was the stronger and what you got was a sort of imposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1810,7264-92310-0021,often quite conscious and direct of advertising power over the press and this was as i have said not only negative that was long obvious but at last positive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1811,7264-92310-0022,both combatants are of a low cunning and unintelligent type minor friction due to the same cause is constantly taking place sometimes the victory falls to the newspaper proprietor more often to the advertiser never to the public,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1812,7264-92310-0023,so far we see the growth of the press marked by these characteristics one it falls into the hands of a very few rich men and nearly always of men of base origin and capacities two it is in their hands a mere commercial enterprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1813,7264-92310-0024,three it is economically supported by advertisers who can in part control it but these are of the same capitalist kind in motive and manner with the owners of the papers their power does not therefore clash in the main with that of the owners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1814,7264-92310-0025,but the fact that advertisement makes a paper has created a standard of printing and paper such that no one save at a disastrous loss can issue regularly to large numbers news and opinion which the large capitalist advertisers disapprove,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1815,7264-92310-0026,there would seem to be for any independent press no possible economic basis because the public has been taught to expect for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1816,7264-92310-0027,the difference being paid by the advertisement subsidy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1817,7264-92310-0028,it is the advent of the great newspaper owner as the true governing power in the political machinery of the state superior to the officials in the state nominating ministers and dismissing them imposing policies and in general usurping sovereignty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1818,7264-92310-0029,all this secretly and without responsibility it is the chief political event of our time and is the peculiar mark of this country to day its full development has come on us suddenly and taken us by surprise in the midst of a terrible war,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1819,7264-92310-0030,it was undreamt of but a few years ago it is already to day the capital fact of our whole political system a prime minister is made or deposed by the owner of a group of newspapers not by popular vote or by any other form of open authority,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1820,7264-92310-0031,no policy is attempted until it is ascertained that the newspaper owner is in favour of it few are proffered without first consulting his wishes many are directly ordered by him we are if we talk in terms of real things as men do in their private councils at westminster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1821,7264-92310-0032,mainly governed to day not even by the professional politicians nor even by those who pay them money but by whatever owner of a newspaper trust is for the moment the most unscrupulous and the most ambitious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1822,7264-92316-0000,the motive of propaganda which began to work much the earliest of the three concerned religions and also certain racial enthusiasms or political doctrines which by their sincerity and readiness for sacrifice had half the force of religions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1823,7264-92316-0001,men found that the great papers in their final phase refused to talk about anything really important in religion they dared do nothing but repeat very discreetly the vaguest ethical platitudes they hardly dared do even that they took for granted a sort of invertebrate common opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1824,7264-92316-0002,and there was an end of it great bodies of men who cared intensely for a definite creed found that expression for it was lacking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1825,7264-92316-0003,the organs of opinion professed a genteel ignorance of that idea which was most widespread most intense and most formative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1826,7264-92316-0004,there was nothing to distinguish a large daily paper owned by a jew from one owned by an agnostic or a catholic necessity of expression compelled the creation of a free press in connection with this one motive of religion men came across very little of this in england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1827,7264-92316-0005,because england was for long virtually homogeneous in religion and that religion was not enthusiastic during the years in which the free press arose but such a free press in defence of religion the pioneer of all the free press arose in ireland and in france and elsewhere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1828,7264-92316-0006,but it asserted the necessity of specially emphasizing its particular point of view in its own columns for religion affects all life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1829,7264-92316-0007,a generation ago and more great numbers of men were persuaded that a solution for the whole complex of social injustice was to be found in what they called nationalizing the means of production distribution and exchange,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1830,7264-92316-0008,that is of course in plain english putting land houses and machinery and stores of food and clothing into the hands of the politicians for control in use and for distribution in consumption,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1831,7264-92316-0009,this creed was held with passionate conviction by men of the highest ability in every country of europe and a socialist press began to arise which was everywhere free and soon in active opposition to the official press,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1832,7264-92316-0010,again of a religious temper in their segregation conviction and enthusiasm there began to appear when the oppressor was mild the small papers defending the rights of oppressed nationalities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1833,7264-92316-0011,religion then and cognate enthusiasms were the first breeders of the free press it is exceedingly important to recognize this because it has stamped the whole movement with a particular character to which i shall later refer when i come to its disabilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1834,7264-92316-0012,felt no particular animosity against the debats for instance his particular catholic enthusiasm recognized itself as exceptional and was content to accept the humble or at any rate inferior position which admitted eccentricity connotes later,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1835,7264-92316-0013,these founders of the free press seemed to say we may convert the mass to our views but for the moment we are admittedly a clique an exceptional body with the penalties attaching to such,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1836,7264-92316-0014,they said this although the whole life of france is at least as catholic as the life of great britain is plutocratic or the life of switzerland democratic and they said it because they arose after the capitalist press neutral in religion as in every vital thing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1837,7264-92316-0015,had captured the whole field the first propagandists then did not stand up to the official press as equals they crept in as inferiors or rather as open ex centrics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1838,7264-92316-0016,for victorian england and third empire france falsely proclaimed the representative quality of the official press to the honour of the socialist movement the socialist free press was the first to stand up as an equal against the giants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1839,7264-92316-0017,to papers like the daily telegraph or the times with the epithet capitalist put after them in brackets i thought then it was the giving of an abnormal epithet to a normal thing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1840,7264-92316-0018,but i now know that these small socialist free papers were talking the plainest common sense when they specifically emphasized as capitalist the falsehoods and suppressions of their great contemporaries,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1841,7264-92316-0019,from the socialist point of view the leading fact about the insincerity of the great official papers is that this insincerity is capitalist just as from a catholic point of view the leading fact about it was and is that it is anti catholic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1842,7264-92316-0020,though however certain of the socialist free papers thus boldly took up a standpoint of moral equality with the others their attitude was exceptional,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1843,7264-92316-0021,the great dailies were thought grey not wicked only general and vague the free press in its beginnings did not attack as an enemy it only timidly claimed to be heard it regarded itself as a speciality it was humble and there went with it a mass of ex centric stuff,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1844,7264-92316-0022,if one passes in review all the free press journals which owed their existence in england and france alone to this motive of propaganda one finds many side shows as it were beside the main motives of local or race patriotism religion or socialist conviction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1845,7264-92316-0023,you have the single tax papers you have the teetotal papers and really it is a wonder that you have not yet also had the iconoclasts and the diabolists producing papers the rationalist and the atheist propaganda i reckon among the religious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1846,7264-92316-0024,we may take it then that propaganda was in order of time the first motive of the free press and the first cause of its production now from this fact arises a consideration of great importance to our subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1847,7264-92316-0025,i mean that the free press has had stamped upon it the character of disparate particularism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1848,7264-92316-0026,but i know that wherever i get hold of such an organ it will be very strongly coloured with the opinion or even fanaticism of some minority the free press as a whole,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1849,7264-92316-0027,if you add it all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement against another does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live the official press to day gives you an absurdly false one everywhere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1850,7264-92316-0028,no one of them is in any sense general or really national the free press gives you the truth but only in disjointed sections for it is disparate and it is particularist it is marked with isolation and it is so marked because its origin lay in various and most diverse propaganda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1851,7264-92316-0029,because it came later than the official press of capitalism and was in its origins but a reaction against it b the second motive that of indignation against falsehood came to work much later than the motive of propaganda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1852,7264-92316-0030,men gradually came to notice that one thing after another of great public interest sometimes of vital public interest was deliberately suppressed in the principal great official papers and that positive falsehoods were increasingly suggested or stated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1853,7264-92316-0031,there was more than this for long the owner of a newspaper had for the most part been content to regard it as a revenue producing thing the editor was supreme in matters of culture and opinion true the editor being revocable and poor could not pretend to full political power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1854,7264-92316-0032,but it was a sort of dual arrangement which yet modified the power of the vulgar owner i myself remember that state of affairs the editor who was a gentleman and dined out the proprietor who was a lord and nervous when he met a gentleman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1855,7264-92316-0033,the editor became and now is a mere mouthpiece of the proprietor editors succeed each other rapidly of great papers to day the editor's name of the moment is hardly known,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1856,7264-92316-0034,but not a cabinet minister that could not pass an examination in the life vices vulnerability fortune investments and favours of the owner the change was rapidly admitted it came quickly but thoroughly at last like most rapid developments it exceeded itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1857,7264-92316-0035,men owning the chief newspapers could be heard boasting of their power in public as an admitted thing and as this power was recognized and as it grew with time and experiment it bred a reaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1858,7264-92316-0036,why should this or that vulgarian men began to say exercise and boast of the power to keep the people ignorant upon matters vital to us all to distort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1859,7264-92316-0037,to lie the sheer necessity of getting certain truths told which these powerful but hidden fellows refused to tell was a force working at high potential and almost compelling the production of free papers side by side with the big official ones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1860,7264-92316-0038,that is why you nearly always find the free press directed by men of intelligence and cultivation of exceptional intelligence and cultivation and that is where it contrasts most with its opponents c,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1861,7264-92316-0039,but only a little later than this second motive of indignation against falsehood and acting with equal force though upon fewer men was the third motive of freedom of indignation against arbitrary power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1862,7264-92316-0040,but it is intolerable that similar power should reside in the hands of obscure nobodies about whom no illusion could possibly exist whose tyranny is not admitted or public at all who do not even take the risk of exposing their features and to whom no responsibility whatever attaches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1863,7264-92316-0041,the knowledge that this was so provided the third and perhaps the most powerful motive for the creation of a free press,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1864,7264-92316-0042,unfortunately it could affect only very few men with the mass even of well educated and observant men the feeling created by the novel power of the great papers was little more than a vague ill ease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1865,7264-92316-0043,they had a general conception that the owner of a widely circulated popular newspaper could and did blackmail the professional politician make or unmake the professional politician by granting or refusing him the limelight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1866,7264-92316-0044,dispose of cabinets nominate absurd ministers but the particular vivid concrete instances that specially move men to action were hidden from them only a small number of people were acquainted with such particular truths,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1867,7264-92316-0045,but that small number knew very well that we were thus in reality governed by men responsible to no one and hidden from public blame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1868,4397-15668-0000,you may walk the deserts of the great basin in the bloom time of the year all the way across from the snowy sierra to the snowy wahsatch and your eyes will be filled with many a gay malva and poppy and abronia and cactus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1869,4397-15668-0001,but you may not see a single true lily and only a very few liliaceous plants of any kind not even in the cool fresh glens of the mountains will you find these favorite flowers though some of these desert ranges almost rival the sierra in height,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1870,4397-15668-0002,nevertheless in the building and planting of this grand territory the lilies were not forgotten far back in the dim geologic ages when the sediments of the old seas were being gathered and outspread in smooth sheets like leaves of a book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1871,4397-15668-0003,and when these sediments became dry land and were baked and crumbled into the sky as mountain ranges when the lava floods of the fire period were being lavishly poured forth from innumerable rifts and craters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1872,4397-15668-0004,when the ice of the glacial period was laid like a mantle over every mountain and valley throughout all these immensely protracted periods in the throng of these majestic operations nature kept her flower children in mind she considered the lilies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1873,4397-15668-0005,and while planting the plains with sage and the hills with cedar she has covered at least one mountain with golden erythroniums and fritillarias as its crowning glory as if willing to show what she could do in the lily line even here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1874,4397-15668-0006,looking southward from the south end of salt lake the two northmost peaks of the oquirrh range are seen swelling calmly into the cool sky without any marked character excepting only their snow crowns,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1875,4397-15668-0007,and a few weedy looking patches of spruce and fir the simplicity of their slopes preventing their real loftiness from being appreciated gray sagey plains circle around their bases and up to a height of a thousand feet or more their sides are tinged with purple,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1876,4397-15668-0008,and over all the smooth crown of snow while standing at their feet the other day shortly after my memorable excursion among the salt waves of the lake i said now i shall have another baptism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1877,4397-15668-0009,i will bathe in the high sky among cool wind waves from the snow from the more southerly of the two peaks a long ridge comes down bent like a bow one end in the hot plains the other in the snow of the summit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1878,4397-15668-0010,after carefully scanning the jagged towers and battlements with which it is roughened i determined to make it my way though it presented but a feeble advertisement of its floral wealth this apparent barrenness however made no great objection just then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1879,4397-15668-0011,i was animated by a mountaineer's eagerness to get my feet into the snow once more and my head into the clear sky after lying dormant all winter at the level of the sea but in every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1880,4397-15668-0012,i had not gone more than a mile from lake point ere i found the way profusely decked with flowers mostly compositae and purple leguminosae a hundred corollas or more to the square yard with a corresponding abundance of winged blossoms above them moths and butterflies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1881,4397-15668-0013,two liliaceous plants in particular erythronium grandiflorum and fritillaria pudica are marvelously beautiful and abundant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1882,4397-15668-0014,never before in all my walks have i met so glorious a throng of these fine showy liliaceous plants the whole mountainside was aglow with them from a height of fifty five hundred feet to the very edge of the snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1883,4397-15668-0015,on the upper side where the bushes were more open but a company composed of the two lilies i have mentioned were blooming on the lower side and though they were as yet out of sight i suddenly changed my mind and went down to meet them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1884,4397-15668-0016,as if attracted by the ringing of their bells they were growing in a small nestlike opening between the rock and the bushes and both the erythronium and the fritillaria were in full flower these were the first of the species i had seen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1885,4397-15668-0017,and i need not try to tell the joy they made they are both lowly plants lowly as violets the tallest seldom exceeding six inches in height so that the most searching winds that sweep the mountains scarce reach low enough to shake their bells,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1886,4397-15668-0018,the petals being strongly recurved like those of lilium superbum occasionally a specimen is met which has from two to five flowers hung in a loose panicle people oftentimes travel far to see curious plants like the carnivorous darlingtonia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1887,4397-15668-0019,the fly catcher the walking fern et cetera i hardly know how the little bells i have been describing would be regarded by seekers of this class but every true flower lover who comes to consider these utah lilies will surely be well rewarded however long the way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1888,4397-15668-0020,pushing on up the rugged slopes i found many delightful seclusions moist nooks at the foot of cliffs and lilies in every one of them not growing close together like daisies but well apart with plenty of room for their bells to swing free and ring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1889,4397-15668-0021,i found hundreds of them in full bloom within two feet of the snow in winter only the bulbs are alive sleeping deep beneath the ground like field mice in their nests then the snow flowers fall above them lilies over lilies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1952,4397-15666-0000,the greater portion of the calendar springtime of utah has been winter in all the upper canyons of the mountains the snow is now from five to ten feet deep or more and most of it has fallen since march,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1953,4397-15666-0001,almost every other day during the last three weeks small local storms have been falling on the wahsatch and oquirrh mountains while the jordan valley remained dry and sun filled but on the afternoon of thursday the seventeenth ultimo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1954,4397-15666-0002,wind rain and snow filled the whole basin driving wildly over valley and plain from range to range bestowing their benefactions in most cordial and harmonious storm measures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1956,4397-15666-0004,the beginning of the outpouring of the treasured wrath of the lord upon the gentiles for the killing of joseph smith to me it seemed a cordial outpouring of nature's love but it is easy to differ with salt latter days in everything storms wives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1957,4397-15666-0005,politics and religion about an hour before the storm reached the city i was so fortunate as to be out with a friend on the banks of the jordan enjoying the scenery clouds with peculiarly restless and self conscious gestures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1958,4397-15666-0006,were marshaling themselves along the mountain tops and sending out long overlapping wings across the valley and even where no cloud was visible an obscuring film absorbed the sunlight giving rise to a cold bluish darkness nevertheless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1959,4397-15666-0007,and their marvelous profusion of ornate sculpture were most impressively manifest one would fancy that a man might be clearly seen walking on the snow at a distance of twenty or thirty miles while we were reveling in this rare ungarish grandeur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1960,4397-15666-0008,turning from range to range studying the darkening sky and listening to the still small voices of the flowers at our feet some of the denser clouds came down crowning and wreathing the highest peaks and dropping long gray fringes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1961,4397-15666-0009,whose smooth linear structure showed that snow was beginning to fall of these partial storms there were soon ten or twelve arranged in two rows while the main jordan valley between them lay as yet in profound calm at four thirty p m,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1962,4397-15666-0010,a dark brownish cloud appeared close down on the plain towards the lake extending from the northern extremity of the oquirrh range in a northeasterly direction as far as the eye could reach its peculiar color and structure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1963,4397-15666-0011,excited our attention without enabling us to decide certainly as to its character but we were not left long in doubt for in a few minutes it came sweeping over the valley in a wild uproar a torrent of wind thick with sand and dust,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1964,4397-15666-0012,advancing with a most majestic front rolling and overcombing like a gigantic sea wave scarcely was it in plain sight ere it was upon us racing across the jordan over the city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1965,4397-15666-0013,and up the slopes of the wahsatch eclipsing all the landscapes in its course the bending trees the dust streamers and the wild onrush of everything movable giving it an appreciable visibility that rendered it grand and inspiring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1966,4397-15666-0014,the crystal flakes falling in the foul streets was a pitiful sight notwithstanding the vaunted refining influences of towns purity of all kinds pure hearts pure streams pure snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1968,4397-15666-0016,even roses and lilies in gardens most loved are tainted with a thousand impurities as soon as they unfold i heard brigham young in the tabernacle the other day warning his people that if they did not mend their manners angels would not come into their houses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1969,4397-15666-0017,though perchance they might be sauntering by with little else to do than chat with them possibly there may be salt lake families sufficiently pure for angel society but i was not pleased with the reception they gave the small snow angels that god sent among them the other night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1970,4397-15666-0018,only the children hailed them with delight the old latter days seemed to shun them i should like to see how mister young the lake prophet would meet such messengers but to return to the storm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1971,4397-15666-0019,toward the evening of the eighteenth it began to wither the snowy skirts of the wahsatch mountains appeared beneath the lifting fringes of the clouds and the sun shone out through colored windows producing one of the most glorious after storm effects i ever witnessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1972,4397-15666-0020,looking across the jordan the gray sagey slopes from the base of the oquirrh mountains were covered with a thick plushy cloth of gold soft and ethereal as a cloud not merely tinted and gilded like a rock with autumn sunshine but deeply muffled beyond recognition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1973,4397-15666-0021,surely nothing in heaven nor any mansion of the lord in all his worlds could be more gloriously carpeted other portions of the plain were flushed with red and purple and all the mountains and the clouds above them were painted in corresponding loveliness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1974,4397-15666-0022,earth and sky round and round the entire landscape was one ravishing revelation of color infinitely varied and interblended i have seen many a glorious sunset beneath lifting storm clouds on the mountains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1975,4397-15666-0023,but nothing comparable with this i felt as if new arrived in some other far off world the mountains the plains the sky all seemed new other experiences seemed but to have prepared me for this as souls are prepared for heaven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1976,4397-15666-0024,trailed their lustrous fringes through the pines as if taking a last view of their accomplished work then came darkness and the glorious day was done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1977,4397-15666-0025,they are covered with common sunshine down here on the banks of the jordan larks and redwings are swinging on the rushes the balmy air is instinct with immortal life the wild flowers the grass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1978,4397-15666-0026,and the farmers grain are fresh as if like the snow they had come out of heaven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1979,298-126791-0000,the morning found them all restored in some measure to their former ease of body with the exception of the youthful captain of dragoons who had been so deeply regretted by dunwoodie the wound of this officer was severe though the surgeon persevered in saying that it was without danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1980,298-126791-0001,and doctor sitgreaves removed all further apprehensions by confidently pronouncing that he would be a well man within a fortnight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1981,298-126791-0002,he breakfasted in his own room and notwithstanding certain significant smiles of the man of science,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1982,298-126791-0003,and the latter advanced promptly and laid his fingers on the pulse of the youth beckoning to him to be silent while he muttered growing symptoms of a febrile pulse no no my dear george you must remain quiet and dumb though your eyes look better and your skin has even a moisture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1983,298-126791-0004,nay my dear sitgreaves said the youth taking his hand you see there is no fever about me look is there any of jack lawton's hoarfrost on my tongue no indeed said the surgeon clapping a spoon in the mouth of the other forcing it open and looking down his throat as if disposed to visit the interior in person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1984,298-126791-0005,the tongue is well and the pulse begins to lower again ah the bleeding did you good phlebotomy is a sovereign specific for southern constitutions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1985,298-126791-0006,why george your case is becoming singular continued the doctor instinctively throwing aside his wig your pulse even and soft your skin moist but your eye fiery and cheek flushed oh i must examine more closely into these symptoms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1986,298-126791-0007,softly my good friend softly said the youth falling back on his pillow and losing some of that color which alarmed his companion i believe in extracting the ball you did for me all that is required i am free from pain and only weak i do assure you captain singleton said the surgeon with heat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1987,298-126791-0008,it is presumptuous in you to pretend to tell your medical attendant when you are free from pain if it be not to enable us to decide in such matters of what avail the lights of science for shame george for shame even that perverse fellow john lawton could not behave with more obstinacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1988,298-126791-0009,his patient smiled as he gently repulsed his physician in an attempt to undo the bandages and with a returning glow to his cheeks inquired,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1989,298-126791-0010,if anyone interferes with my patients cried the doctor hastily i will teach them spirit or no spirit what it is to meddle with another man's concerns tut my dear fellow there was no interference made nor any intended see exhibiting the bandages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1990,298-126791-0011,everything is as you left it but it glided about the room with the grace of a fairy and the tenderness of an angel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1991,298-126791-0012,as he inquired with a brevity that would have honored lieutenant mason had it petticoats george i saw nothing but its heavenly eyes its bloom its majestic step its grace replied the young man with rather more ardor than his surgeon thought consistent with his debilitated condition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1992,298-126791-0013,hem with something of the kind of step you speak of a very complacent eye and as to the bloom i dare say offices of charity can summon as fine a color to her cheeks as glows in the faces of her more youthful nieces nieces has she nieces then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1993,298-126791-0014,the angel i saw may be a daughter a sister or a niece but never an aunt hush george hush your talking has brought your pulse up again you must observe quiet and prepare for a meeting with your own sister who will be here within an hour what isabella and who sent for her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1994,298-126791-0015,the major considerate dunwoodie murmured the exhausted youth sinking again on his pillow where the commands of his attendant compelled him to remain silent even captain lawton had been received with many and courteous inquiries after the state of his health,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1995,298-126791-0016,from all the members of the family when he made his morning entrance but an invisible spirit presided over the comforts of the english colonel sarah had shrunk with consciousness from entering the room yet she knew the position of every glass and had with her own hands supplied the contents of every bowl that stood on his table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1996,298-126791-0017,at the time of our tale we were a divided people and sarah thought it was no more than her duty to cherish the institutions of that country to which she yet clung as the land of her forefathers but there were other and more cogent reasons for the silent preference she was giving to the englishman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1997,298-126791-0018,it is true he wanted the personal excellence of peyton dunwoodie but his pretensions were far from contemptible sarah had moved about the house during the morning casting frequent and longing glances at the door of wellmere's apartment anxious to learn the condition of his wounds and yet ashamed to inquire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1998,298-126791-0019,conscious interest kept her tongue tied until her sister with the frankness of innocence had put the desired question to doctor sitgreaves colonel wellmere said the operator gravely is in what i call a state of free will madam he is ill or he is well as he pleases,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1999,298-126791-0020,his case young lady exceeds my art to heal and i take it sir henry clinton is the best adviser he can apply to though major dunwoodie has made the communication with his leech rather difficult frances smiled but averted her face while sarah moved with the grace of an offended juno from the apartment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2000,298-126791-0021,her own room however afforded her but little relief and in passing through the long gallery that communicated with each of the chambers of the building she noticed the door of singleton's room to be open the wounded youth seemed sleeping and was alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2001,298-126791-0022,and possibly dreaming that these little feminine offices were performed for another her natural bloom was heightened by the insinuation of the surgeon nor was the luster of her eye in any degree diminished the sound of the approaching footsteps of sitgreaves hastened her retreat down a private stairway to the side of her sister,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2002,298-126791-0023,the sisters then sought the fresh air on the piazza and as they pursued their walk arm in arm the following dialogue took place there is something disagreeable about this surgeon of dunwoodie said sarah that causes me to wish him away most heartily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2003,298-126791-0024,frances fixed her laughing eyes on her sister but forbearing to speak the other readily construed their expression and hastily added but i forget he is one of your renowned corps of virginians and must be spoken of reverently as respectfully as you please my dear sister,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2004,298-126791-0025,there is but little danger of exceeding the truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2005,298-126791-0026,but i think mister dunwoodie has taken a liberty that exceeds the rights of consanguinity he has made our father's house a hospital we ought to be grateful that none of the patients it contains are dearer to us your brother is one true true interrupted frances blushing to the eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2006,298-126791-0027,but he leaves his room and thinks his wound lightly purchased by the pleasure of being with his friends if she added with a tremulous lip this dreadful suspicion that is affixed to his visit were removed i could consider his wound of little moment you now have the fruits of rebellion brought home to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2007,298-126791-0028,a brother wounded and a prisoner and perhaps a victim your father distressed his privacy interrupted and not improbably his estates torn from him on account of his loyalty to his king frances continued her walk in silence while facing the northern entrance to the vale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2008,298-126791-0029,her eyes were uniformly fastened on the point where the road was suddenly lost by the intervention of a hill and at each turn as she lost sight of the spot she lingered until an impatient movement of her sister quickened her pace to an even motion with that of her own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2009,298-126791-0030,at length a single horse chaise was seen making its way carefully among the stones which lay scattered over the country road that wound through the valley and approached the cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2010,298-126791-0031,the color of frances changed as the vehicle gradually drew nearer and when she was enabled to see a female form in it by the side of a black in livery her limbs shook with an agitation that compelled her to lean on sarah for support in a few minutes the travelers approached the gate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2011,298-126791-0032,it was thrown open by a dragoon who followed the carriage and who had been the messenger dispatched by dunwoodie to the father of captain singleton miss peyton advanced to receive their guest and the sisters united in giving her the kindest welcome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2012,298-126791-0033,still frances could with difficulty withdraw her truant eyes from the countenance of their visitor she was young and of a light and fragile form but of exquisite proportions her eyes were large full black piercing and at times a little wild her hair was luxuriant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2013,298-126791-0034,and as it was without the powder it was then the fashion to wear it fell in raven blackness a few of its locks had fallen on her cheek giving its chilling whiteness by the contrast a more deadly character,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2014,298-126791-0035,doctor sitgreaves supported her from the chaise and when she gained the floor of the piazza she turned an expressive look on the face of the practitioner your brother is out of danger and wishes to see you miss singleton said the surgeon the lady burst into a flood of tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2015,298-126791-0036,frances had stood contemplating the action and face of isabella with a kind of uneasy admiration but she now sprang to her side with the ardor of a sister and kindly drawing her arm within her own led the way to a retired room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2016,298-126791-0037,the feeling was communicated to all the spectators and they dispersed in pursuit of their usual avocations isabella yielded to the gentle influence of frances without resistance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2017,298-126791-0038,and having gained the room where the latter conducted her wept in silence on the shoulder of the observant and soothing girl until frances thought her tears exceeded the emotion natural to the occasion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2018,298-126791-0039,the sobs of miss singleton for a time were violent and uncontrollable until with an evident exertion she yielded to a kind observation of her companion and succeeded in suppressing her tears raising her face to the eyes of frances she rose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2019,298-126791-0040,more composed than her previous agitation had given reason to expect isabella found her brother looking better and in less danger than her sensitive imagination had led her to suppose her spirits rose in proportion from despondency she passed to something like gayety,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2020,298-126791-0041,her beautiful eyes sparkled with renovated brilliancy and her face was lighted with smiles so fascinating that frances who in compliance with her earnest entreaties had accompanied her to the sick chamber sat gazing on a countenance that possessed so wonderful variability,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2021,298-126791-0042,impelled by a charm that was beyond her control the youth had thrown an earnest look at frances as soon as his sister raised herself from his arms and perhaps it was the first glance at the lovely lineaments of our heroine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2022,298-126791-0043,when the gazer turned his eyes from the view in disappointment he seemed bewildered rubbed his forehead like a man awaking from a dream and mused where is dunwoodie isabella he said the excellent fellow is never weary of kind actions after a day of such service as that of yesterday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2023,298-126791-0044,he has spent the night in bringing me a nurse whose presence alone is able to raise me from my couch the expression of the lady's countenance changed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2024,298-126791-0045,but isabella the meeting has been too much for you you tremble isabella made no reply she stretched her hand towards the table which held the nourishment of the captain and the attentive frances comprehended her wishes in a moment a glass of water in some measure revived the sister who was enabled to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2025,298-126791-0046,doubtless it is his duty twas said above a royal party was moving on the river though i passed the troops but two miles from this spot the latter part of the sentence was hardly audible and it was spoken more in the manner of a soliloquy than as if for the ears of her companions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2026,298-126791-0047,on the march isabella eagerly inquired her brother no dismounted and seemingly at rest was the reply the wondering dragoon turned his gaze on the countenance of his sister who sat with her eye bent on the carpet in unconscious absence but found no explanation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2027,298-126791-0048,his look was changed to the face of frances who startled by the earnestness of his expression arose and hastily inquired if he would have any assistance if you can pardon the rudeness said the wounded officer making a feeble effort to raise his body i would request to have captain lawton's company for a moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2028,298-126791-0049,frances hastened instantly to communicate his wish to that gentleman and impelled by an interest she could not control she returned again to her seat by the side of miss singleton lawton said the youth impatiently as the trooper entered hear you from the major,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2029,298-126791-0050,the eye of the sister was now bent on the face of the trooper who made his salutations to the lady with ease blended with the frankness of a soldier his man has been here twice he said to inquire how we fared in the lazaretto and why not himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2030,298-126791-0051,that is a question the major can answer best but you know the redcoats are abroad and dunwoodie commands in the county these english must be looked to true said singleton slowly as if struck with the other's reasons but how is it that you are idle when there is work to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2031,298-126791-0052,my sword arm is not in the best condition and roanoke has but a shambling gait this morning besides there is another reason i could mention if it were not that miss wharton would never forgive me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2032,298-126791-0053,speak i beg without dread of my displeasure said frances returning the good humored smile of the trooper with the archness natural to her own sweet face the odors of your kitchen then cried lawton bluntly forbid my quitting the domains until i qualify myself to speak with more certainty concerning the fatness of the land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2033,298-126791-0054,oh aunt jeanette is exerting herself to do credit to my father's hospitality said the laughing girl and i am a truant from her labors as i shall be a stranger to her favor unless i proffer my assistance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2034,298-126791-0055,frances withdrew to seek her aunt musing deeply on the character and extreme sensibility of the new acquaintance chance had brought to the cottage the wounded officer followed her with his eyes as she moved with infantile grace through the door of his apartment and as she vanished from his view he observed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2035,298-126791-0056,a good motherly lady but as to love that is a matter of taste a few years younger with deference to her prudence and experience would accord better with my fancy she must be under twenty said the other quickly it depends on the way you count if you begin at the heel of life well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2036,298-126791-0057,but if you reckon downward as is most common i think she is nearer forty you have mistaken an elder sister for the aunt said isabella laying her fair hand on the mouth of the invalid you must be silent your feelings are beginning to affect your frame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2037,298-126791-0058,the entrance of doctor sitgreaves who in some alarm noticed the increase of feverish symptoms in his patient enforced this mandate and the trooper withdrew to pay a visit of condolence to roanoke who had been an equal sufferer with himself in their last night's somersault,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2038,298-126791-0059,to his great joy his man pronounced the steed to be equally convalescent with the master and lawton found that by dint of rubbing the animal's limbs several hours without ceasing he was enabled to place his feet in what he called systematic motion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2039,298-126791-0060,orders were accordingly given to be in readiness to rejoin the troop at the four corners as soon as his master had shared in the bounty of the approaching banquet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2040,298-126791-0061,and by his sympathy succeeded in restoring the colonel to his own good graces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2041,298-126791-0062,wharton knew that their misfortune as they both termed their defeat was owing to the other's rashness but he forbore to speak of anything except the unfortunate accident which had deprived the english of their leader and to which he good naturedly ascribed their subsequent discomfiture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2042,298-126791-0063,in short wharton said the colonel putting one leg out of bed it may be called a combination of untoward events your own ungovernable horse prevented my orders from being carried to the major in season to flank the rebels very true replied the captain kicking a slipper towards the bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2043,298-126791-0064,had we succeeded in getting a few good fires upon them in flank we should have sent these brave virginians to the right about aye and that in double quick time cried the colonel making the other leg follow its companion then it was necessary to rout the guides you know and the movement gave them the best possible opportunity to charge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2044,298-126791-0065,yes said the other sending the second slipper after the first and this major dunwoodie never overlooks an advantage i think if we had the thing to do over again continued the colonel raising himself on his feet we might alter the case very materially though the chief thing the rebels have now to boast of is my capture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2045,298-126791-0066,they were repulsed you saw in their attempt to drive us from the wood at least they would have been had they made an attack said the captain throwing the rest of his clothes within reach of the colonel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2046,298-126791-0067,true true cried the colonel with animation had i been there to have improved that advantage we might have turned the table on the yankees saying which he displayed still greater animation in completing his toilet and he was soon prepared to make his appearance fully restored to his own good opinion and fairly persuaded that his capture was owing to casualties absolutely beyond the control of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2047,298-126790-0000,the family at the locusts had slept or watched through all the disturbances at the cottage of birch in perfect ignorance of their occurrence the attacks of the skinners were always made with so much privacy as to exclude the sufferers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2048,298-126790-0001,but frequently through a dread of future depredations from the commiseration of their neighbors also additional duties had drawn the ladies from their pillows at an hour somewhat earlier than usual and captain lawton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2049,298-126790-0002,notwithstanding the sufferings of his body had risen in compliance with a rule from which he never departed of sleeping but six hours at a time this was one of the few points in which the care of the human frame was involved on which the trooper and the surgeon of horse were ever known to agree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2050,298-126790-0003,the doctor had watched during the night by the side of the bed of captain singleton without once closing his eyes occasionally he would pay a visit to the wounded englishman who being more hurt in the spirit than in the flesh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2051,298-126790-0004,tolerated the interruptions with a very ill grace and once for an instant he ventured to steal softly to the bed of his obstinate comrade and was near succeeding in obtaining a touch of his pulse when a terrible oath sworn by the trooper in a dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2052,298-126790-0005,startled the prudent surgeon and warned him of a trite saying in the corps that captain lawton always slept with one eye open this group had assembled in one of the parlors as the sun made its appearance over the eastern hill dispersing the columns of fog which had enveloped the lowland,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2053,298-126790-0006,miss peyton was looking from a window in the direction of the tenement of the peddler and was expressing a kind anxiety after the welfare of the sick man when the person of katy suddenly emerged from the dense covering of an earthly cloud whose mists were scattering before the cheering rays of the sun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2054,298-126790-0007,and was seen making hasty steps towards the locusts there was that in the air of the housekeeper which bespoke distress of an unusual nature and the kind hearted mistress of the locusts opened the door of the room with the benevolent intention of soothing a grief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2055,298-126790-0008,that seemed so overwhelming a nearer view of the disturbed features of the visitor confirmed miss peyton in her belief and with the shock that gentle feelings ever experience at a sudden and endless separation from even the meanest of their associates she said hastily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2056,298-126790-0009,katy is he gone no ma'am replied the disturbed damsel with great bitterness he is not yet gone but he may go as soon as he pleases now for the worst is done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2057,298-126790-0010,and those he has on are none of the best i can tell you how exclaimed the other astonished could anyone have the heart to plunder a man in such distress hearts repeated katy catching her breath men like them have no bowels at all plunder and distress indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2058,298-126790-0011,why ma'am there were in the iron pot in plain sight fifty four guineas of gold besides what lay underneath which i couldn't count without handling and i didn't like to touch it for they say that another's gold is apt to stick so judging from that in sight there wasn't less than two hundred guineas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2059,298-126790-0012,besides what might have been in the deerskin purse but harvey is little better now than a beggar and a beggar miss jeanette is the most awfully despisable of all earthly creatures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2060,298-126790-0013,the countenance of katy changed from the natural expression of concern to the set form of melancholy as she answered he is happily removed from the cares of the world the chinking of the money made him get out of his bed and the poor soul found the shock too great for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2061,298-126790-0014,he died about two hours and ten minutes before the cock crowed as near as we can say she was interrupted by the physician who approaching inquired with much interest the nature of the disorder glancing her eye over the figure of this new acquaintance katy instinctively adjusting her dress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2062,298-126790-0015,replied twas the troubles of the times and the loss of property that brought him down he wasted from day to day and all my care and anxiety were lost for now harvey is no better than a beggar and who is there to pay me for what i have done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2063,298-126790-0016,god will reward you for all the good you have done said miss peyton mildly yes interrupted the spinster hastily and with an air of reverence that was instantly succeeded by an expression that denoted more of worldly care,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2064,298-126790-0017,but then i have left my wages for three years past in the hands of harvey and how am i to get them my brothers told me again and again to ask for my money but i always thought accounts between relations were easily settled were you related then to birch asked miss peyton observing her to pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2065,298-126790-0018,why returned the housekeeper hesitating a little i thought we were as good as so i wonder if i have no claim on the house and garden though they say now it is harvey's it will surely be confiscated turning to lawton who had been sitting in one posture with his,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2066,298-126790-0019,piercing eyes lowering at her through his thick brows in silence perhaps this gentleman knows he seems to take an interest in my story madam said the trooper bowing very low both you and the tale are extremely interesting katy smiled involuntarily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2067,298-126790-0020,but my humble knowledge is limited to the setting of a squadron in the field and using it when there i beg leave to refer you to doctor archibald sitgreaves a gentleman of universal attainments and unbounded philanthropy the very milk of human sympathies and a mortal foe to all indiscriminate cutting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2068,298-126790-0021,the surgeon drew up and employed himself in whistling a low air as he looked over some phials on a table but the housekeeper turning to him with an inclination of the head continued i suppose sir a woman has no dower in her husband's property unless they be actually married,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2069,298-126790-0022,it was a maxim with doctor sitgreaves that no species of knowledge was to be despised and consequently he was an empiric in everything but his profession at first indignation at the irony of his comrade kept him silent but suddenly changing his purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2070,298-126790-0023,he answered the applicant with a good natured smile i judge not if death has anticipated your nuptials i am fearful you have no remedy against his stern decrees to katy this sounded well although she understood nothing of its meaning but death and nuptials,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2071,298-126790-0024,to this part of his speech then she directed her reply i did think he only waited the death of the old gentleman before he married said the housekeeper looking on the carpet but now he is nothing more than despisable or what's the same thing a peddler without house pack or money,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2072,298-126790-0025,it might be hard for a man to get a wife at all in such a predicary don't you think it would miss peyton i seldom trouble myself with such things said the lady gravely during this dialogue captain lawton had been studying the countenance and manner of the housekeeper with a most ludicrous gravity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2073,298-126790-0026,and fearful the conversation would cease he inquired with an appearance of great interest you think it was age and debility that removed the old gentleman at last and the troublesome times trouble is a heavy pull down to a sick bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2074,298-126790-0027,but i suppose his time had come and when that happens it matters but little what doctor's stuff we take let me set you right in that particular interrupted the surgeon we must all die it is true but it is permitted us to use the lights of science in arresting dangers as they occur until,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2075,298-126790-0028,we can die secundem artem cried the trooper to this observation the physician did not deign to reply but deeming it necessary to his professional dignity that the conversation should continue he added perhaps in this instance judicious treatment might have prolonged the life of the patient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2076,298-126790-0029,who administered to the case no one yet said the housekeeper with quickness i expect he has made his last will and testament the surgeon disregarded the smile of the ladies and pursued his inquiries it is doubtless wise to be prepared for death but under whose care was the sick man during his indisposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2077,298-126790-0030,under mine answered katy with an air of a little importance and care thrown away i may well call it for harvey is quite too despisable to be any sort of compensation at present the mutual ignorance of each other's meaning made very little interruption to the dialogue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2078,298-126790-0031,i doctored him mostly with yarbs said the housekeeper smiling as if conscious of error with simples returned the surgeon they are safer in the hands of the unlettered than more powerful remedies but why had you no regular attendant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2079,298-126790-0032,i'm sure harvey has suffered enough already from having so much concerns with the rig'lars replied the housekeeper he has lost his all and made himself a vagabond through the land and i have reason to rue the day i ever crossed the threshold of his house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2080,298-126790-0033,doctor sitgreaves does not mean a rig'lar soldier but a regular physician madam said the trooper oh cried the maiden again correcting herself for the best of all reasons there was none to be had so i took care of him myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2081,298-126790-0034,for my part i am clear for doctoring though harvey says i am killing myself with medicines,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2082,298-126790-0035,therein you show your sense said the surgeon approaching the spinster who sat holding the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet to the genial heat of a fine fire making the most of comfort amid all her troubles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2083,298-126790-0036,you appear to be a sensible discreet woman and some who have had opportunities of acquiring more correct views might envy you your respect for knowledge and the lights of science although the housekeeper did not altogether comprehend the other's meaning she knew he used a compliment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2084,298-126790-0037,and as such was highly pleased with what he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2085,298-126790-0038,it was always said of me that i wanted nothing but opportunity to make quite a physician myself so long as before i came to live with harvey's father they called me the petticoat doctor more true than civil i dare say returned the surgeon losing sight of the woman's character in his admiration of her respect for the healing art,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2086,298-126790-0039,in the absence of more enlightened counselors the experience of a discreet matron is frequently of great efficacy in checking the progress of disease under such circumstances madam it is dreadful to have to contend with ignorance and obstinacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2087,298-126790-0040,harvey is as obstinate about such things as a dumb beast one would think the care i took of his bedridden father might learn him better than to despise good nursing but some day he may know what it is to want a careful woman in his house though now i am sure he is too despisable himself to have a house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2088,298-126790-0041,indeed i can easily comprehend the mortification you must have felt in having one so self willed to deal with returned the surgeon glancing his eyes reproachfully at his comrade but you should rise superior to such opinions and pity the ignorance by which they are engendered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2089,298-126790-0042,the housekeeper hesitated a moment at a loss to comprehend all that the surgeon expressed yet she felt it was both complimentary and kind therefore suppressing her natural flow of language a little she replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2090,298-126790-0043,i tell harvey his conduct is often condemnable and last night he made my words good but the opinions of such unbelievers is not very consequential yet it is dreadful to think how he behaves at times now when he threw away the needle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2091,298-126790-0044,what said the surgeon interrupting her does he affect to despise the needle but it is my lot to meet with men daily who are equally perverse and who show a still more culpable disrespect for the information that flows from the lights of science,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2092,2289-152258-0000,a great number of people in asia and africa and much of those in turkey in europe profess the mo ham'me dan religion they are called mohammedans mus'sul mans or moslems,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2093,2289-152258-0001,and the proper name for their religion is islam which means obedience or submission,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2094,2289-152258-0002,a city of arabia his parents were poor people though it is said they were descended from arabian princes they died when mohammed was a child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2095,2289-152258-0003,and brought him up when the boy grew old enough he took care of his uncle's sheep and camels sometimes he went on journeys with his uncle to different parts of arabia to help him in his business as a trader on these journeys mohammed used to ride on a camel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2096,2289-152258-0004,and he soon became a skillful camel driver mohammed was very faithful and honest in all his work he always spoke the truth and never broke a promise i have given my promise he would say and i must keep it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2097,2289-152258-0005,that people gave him the name of el amin which means the truthful at this time he was only sixteen years of age but the rich traders had so much confidence in him that they gave him important business to attend to and trusted him with large sums of money,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2098,2289-152258-0006,and sold there the goods carried by the camels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2099,2289-152258-0007,and faithfully paid over to the owners of the goods the money he had received mohammed had no school education he could neither read nor write but he was not ignorant he knew well how to do the work intrusted to him and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2100,2289-152258-0008,this woman was a widow who was carrying on the business left her by her husband as soon as the camel driver saw mohammed he stopped him and said my mistress wishes to see you before noon i think she intends to engage you to take charge of her caravans,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2101,2289-152258-0009,as quickly as possible he went to the house of khadijah for he was well pleased at the thought of being employed in so important a service,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2102,2289-152258-0010,she said i have heard much of you among the traders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2103,2289-152258-0011,are you willing to take charge of my caravans and give your whole time and service to me mohammed was delighted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2104,2289-152258-0012,khadijah then engaged him as the manager of her business and he served her well and faithfully she thought a great deal of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2105,2289-152258-0013,and soon they came to love one another and were married as he was now the husband of a rich woman he did not need to work very hard he still continued to attend to his wife's business but he did not make so many journeys as before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2106,2289-152258-0014,and christianity but he was not satisfied with either of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2107,2289-152258-0015,worshiped idols very few of them were christians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2108,2289-152258-0016,in a cave on mount hira near mecca he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious meditation he declared that while praying in his cave he often had visions of god and heaven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2109,2289-152258-0017,he said that many times the angel gabriel appeared to him and revealed to him the religion which he afterwards taught his followers as he himself could not write he committed to memory all that the angel told him and had it written in a book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2110,2289-152258-0018,this book is called the koran which means like our own word bible the book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2111,2289-152258-0019,three when mohammed returned home after the angel had first spoken to him he told his wife of what he had seen and heard she at once believed and so became a convert to the new religion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2112,2289-152258-0020,she fell upon her knees at the feet of her husband and cried out there is but one god mohammed is god's prophet mohammed then told the story to other members of his family some of them believed and became his first followers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2113,2289-152258-0021,soon afterwards he began to preach to the people he spoke in the market and other public places,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2114,2289-152258-0022,laughed at what he told them but some poor people and a few slaves believed him and adopted the new religion others said he was a dreamer and a fool mohammed however paid no heed to the insults he received,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2115,2289-152258-0023,he went on telling about the appearance of gabriel and preaching the doctrines which he said the angel had ordered him to teach the people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2116,2289-152258-0024,at such times his face grew pale as death his eyes became red and staring he spoke in a loud voice and his body trembled violently then he would tell what he had seen in his vision,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2117,2289-152258-0025,people came from distant parts of arabia and from neighboring countries to hear him one day six of the chief men of me di'na,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2183,2289-152254-0019,but he first marched his men across the alps through gaul and down to the seaport of carthagena in spain where his fleet was stationed he took this route because he expected to add to his forces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2184,2289-152254-0020,as he went along before sailing with his army for carthage he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people the vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was generally believed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2185,2289-152254-0021,and entertained him hospitably not knowing that he was the emperor majorian of course peace was not made the emperor left carthage after having got as much information as he could,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2186,2289-152254-0022,but genseric did not wait for the roman fleet to come to attack him in his capital when he got word that it was in the bay of carthagena he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single day burned or sank nearly all the roman ships,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2187,2289-152254-0023,after this the vandals became more than ever the terror of the mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it every year their ships went round the coasts from asia minor to spain attacking and plundering cities on their way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2188,2289-152254-0024,and carrying off prisoners all the efforts of the romans failed to put a stop to these ravages the emperor leo who ruled over the eastern division of the empire fitted out a great fleet at constantinople,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2189,2289-152254-0025,to make another attempt to suppress the pirates there were more than a thousand ships in this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2190,2289-152254-0026,the brother of emperor leo's wife basilicus sailed with his ships to africa and landed the army not far from carthage genseric asked for a truce for five days to consider terms of peace and the truce was granted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2191,2289-152254-0027,but the cunning vandal was not thinking of peace he only wanted time to carry out a plan he had made to destroy the roman fleet one dark night during the truce he filled the largest of his ships,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2192,2289-152254-0028,in among the roman ships towing behind them large boats filled with material that would easily burn these boats were set on fire and floated against the roman vessels which also were soon on fire the flames quickly spread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2193,2289-152254-0029,and in a very short time a great part of the roman fleet was destroyed basilicus fled with as many ships as he could save and returned to constantinople this was the last attempt of the romans to conquer the vandals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2194,2289-152257-0000,in the time of clovis the country now called bulgaria was inhabited by goths one day a poor shepherd boy about sixteen years of age left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of constantinople which was many miles away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2195,2289-152257-0001,but he was determined to go even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live on fruits that he could gather by the way he was a bright clever boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village but was now eager to go out into the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2196,2289-152257-0002,to seek his fortune some years before this boy's uncle who was named justin had gone to constantinople and joined the roman army he was so brave and so good a soldier that he soon came to be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2197,2289-152257-0003,commander of the imperial guard which attended the emperor the poor shepherd boy had heard of the success of his uncle and this was the reason why he resolved to set off for the big city so he started down the mountain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2198,2289-152257-0004,and trudged along the valley in high hope feeling certain that he would reach the end of his journey in safety,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2199,2289-152257-0005,and to cross rivers and high hills but at last one afternoon in midsummer he walked through the main gate of constantinople proud and happy that he had accomplished his purpose he had no trouble in finding his uncle justin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2200,2289-152257-0006,and gave him the best education that could be had in the city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2201,2289-152257-0007,richly dressed he was well liked at the emperor's court and was respected by everybody on account of his learning two one day a great change came for both uncle and nephew the emperor died,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2202,2289-152257-0008,in ruling the empire justinus agreed to this proposal for he was now old and in feeble health and not able himself to attend to the important affairs of government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2203,2289-152257-0009,justinian reigned for nearly forty years and did so many important things that he was afterwards called justinian the great he had many wars during his reign but he himself did not take part in them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2204,2289-152257-0010,he was fortunate enough however to have two great generals to lead his armies one of them was named belisarius and the other narses belisarius was one of the greatest soldiers that ever lived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2205,2289-152257-0011,he gained wonderful victories for justinian and conquered some of the old roman provinces that had been lost for many years the victories of these two generals largely helped to make the reign of justinian remarkable in history,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2206,2289-152257-0012,that were carried on a fleet of six hundred ships it took this fleet three months to make the voyage from constantinople to africa the same voyage may now be made in a very few days but in the time of belisarius there were no steamships,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2207,2289-152257-0013,and nothing was known of the power of steam for moving machinery the ships or galleys were sailing vessels and when there was no wind they could make no progress except by rowing when belisarius reached africa,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2208,2289-152257-0014,he left five men as a guard in each vessel and with the body of his army he marched for some days along the coast the people received him in a friendly way for they had grown tired of the rule of the vandals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2209,2289-152257-0015,and preferred to be under the government of the romans about ten miles from carthage he met a large army led by the brother of gelimer a battle immediately took place and the vandals were utterly defeated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2210,2289-152257-0016,gelimer gave himself up to belisarius who took him to constantinople justinian set apart an estate for him to live upon and the conquered king passed the rest of his life in peaceful retirement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2211,2289-152257-0017,after conquering the vandals justinian resolved to conquer italy which was then held by the ostrogoths a large army was got together and put under the command of belisarius and narses who immediately set out for italy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2212,2289-152257-0018,when they arrived there they marched straight to rome and after some fighting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2213,2289-152257-0019,but in a few months vit'i ges king of the goths appeared with an army before the gates and challenged belisarius and narses to come out and fight the roman generals however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2214,2289-152257-0020,laid siege to the city thinking that he would compel the romans to surrender but instead of having any thought of surrender belisarius was preparing his men for fight and when they were ready he attacked vitiges and defeated him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2215,2289-152257-0021,vitiges retired to ravenna and belisarius quickly followed and made such an assault on the city that it was compelled to surrender the ostrogoth army was captured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2217,2289-152257-0023,the work for which he is most celebrated was the improving and collecting of the laws he made many excellent new laws and reformed many of the old laws so that he became famous as one of the greatest of the world's legislators,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2218,2289-152257-0024,for a long time the roman laws had been difficult to understand there was a vast number of them and different writers differed widely as to what the laws really were and what they meant justinian employed a great lawyer named,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2219,2289-152257-0025,trib o'ni an to collect and simplify the principal laws the collection which he made was called the code of justinian it still exists and is the model according to which most of the countries of europe have made their laws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2220,2289-152257-0026,justinian also did a great deal of good by establishing a number of manufactures in constantinople it was he who first brought silk worms into europe to the last year of his life justinian was strong and active,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2221,2289-152257-0027,and a hard worker he often worked or studied all day and all night without eating or sleeping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2222,1081-125237-0000,before the sittings of the great assembly had come to an end a young statesman destined to play the leading part in the government of the dutch republic during two decades had already made his mark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2223,1081-125237-0001,his readiness and persuasiveness of speech his industry and his gifts at once of swift insight and orderly thoroughness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2224,1081-125237-0002,but the old sores remained open moreover the refusal of the states general to receive the parliamentary envoys the murder of doreslaer and the protection afforded to royalist refugees had been additional causes of resentment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2225,1081-125237-0003,but the english council had not felt strong enough to take action the death of the prince of orange,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2226,1081-125237-0004,appeared at first to open out a prospect of friendlier relations between the two neighbouring republics in january sixteen fifty one the great assembly formally recognised the commonwealth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2228,1081-125237-0006,and saint john and strickland greeted with loud cries of regicides and many abusive epithets remembering the fate of doreslaer were in fear of their lives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2229,1081-125237-0007,on april fourth a conference was opened between the envoys and six commissioners appointed by the states to consider the proposals of the english government for a more strict and intimate alliance and union between the two states the dutch quickly perceived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2230,1081-125237-0008,that what the english really wanted was nothing less than such a binding alliance or rather coalition as would practically merge the lesser state in the greater but the very idea of such a loss of the independence that they had only just won was to the netherlanders unthinkable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2231,1081-125237-0009,the negotiations came to a deadlock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2232,1081-125237-0010,foremost amongst them prince edward son of the queen of bohemia the parliament threatened to recall the envoys but consented that they should remain on the undertaking of the estates of holland to protect them from further attacks and to punish the offenders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2233,1081-125237-0011,new proposals were accordingly made for an offensive and defensive alliance without any suggestion of a union coupled with the condition that both states should bind themselves not to allow the presence within their boundaries of avowed enemies of the other in other words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2235,1081-125237-0013,even the estates of holland dared not consider such terms and the states general would have angrily rejected them after some further parleying therefore about fisheries and trade restrictions it was felt that no agreement could be reached,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2236,1081-125237-0014,and saint john and strickland returned to england on july thirty first sixteen fifty one their failure created a very bad impression upon the parliament all the old complaints against the dutch were revived and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2237,1081-125237-0015,as they had refused the offer of friendship that had been made to them it was resolved that strong measures should be taken to obtain redress for past grievances and for the protection of english trade interests at the instance of saint john,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2238,1081-125237-0016,the famous navigation act was passed by the parliament october ninth sixteen fifty one this act struck a mortal blow at the dutch carrying trade by forbidding the importation of foreign goods into english ports except in english bottoms or in those of the countries which had produced the goods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2239,1081-125237-0017,scarcely less injurious was the prohibition to aliens to fish in british waters and the withdrawal of the rights based on the magnus intercursus for the maintenance of which dutch statesmen had so long and strenuously fought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2243,1081-125237-0021,the english government however met the dutch complaints by raking up the long list of grievances that had stirred up a bitter feeling of popular hatred against the united provinces in england and by demanding reparation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2244,1081-125237-0022,they further demanded that dutch commanders should acknowledge england's sovereignty by striking flag and sail and by firing a salute whenever any of their squadrons met english ships in the narrow seas it was these last two questions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2245,1081-125237-0023,the right of search and the striking of the flag that were to be the real causes of the outbreak of a war that was desired by neither of the two governments but popular feeling and the course of events was too strong for them the news of the seizure of their vessels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2248,1081-125237-0026,the council of state on hearing of this began also to make ready for eventualities negotiations were still proceeding between the two countries when martin tromp the victor of the battle of the downs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2249,1081-125237-0027,now lieutenant admiral of holland was sent to sea with fifty ships and instructions to protect dutch merchantmen from interference and to see that the states suffered no affront nothing was actually said about the striking of the flag,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2251,1081-125237-0029,tromp declared that he had given orders to strike the flag but that blake again fired before there was time to carry them out be this as it may the two fleets were soon engaged in a regular fight and the english being reinforced tromp withdrew at nightfall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2252,1081-125237-0030,to the french coast having lost two ships great was the anger aroused in england where the dutch were universally regarded as the aggressors in the netherlands where the peace party was strong many were disposed to blame tromp despite his protests,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2253,1081-125237-0031,adrian pauw himself left hastily for london john de witt being appointed to act as his deputy during his absence pauw's strenuous efforts however to maintain peace were all in vain despite the strong leanings of cromwell towards a peaceful solution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2254,1081-125237-0032,but popular feeling on both sides was now aroused,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2255,1081-125237-0033,if humiliating terms were submitted to stiffened their attitude the result was that the envoys left london on june thirtieth sixteen fifty two and war was declared the dutch statesmen who sought to avoid hostilities were right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2256,1081-125237-0034,all the advantages were on the side of their enemies the dutch merchant fleets covered the seas and the welfare of the land depended on commerce the english had little to lose commercially,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2259,1081-125237-0037,and in long cruises to the west indies for the purpose of forcing the english colonies to acknowledge parliamentary rule the crews therefore were well trained and the ships were larger stronger and better armed than those of the dutch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2260,1081-125237-0038,the position of england lying as it did athwart the routes by which the dutch merchant fleets must sail was a great advantage even more important was the advantage of having a central control,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2261,1081-125237-0039,whereas in the netherlands there were five distinct boards of admiralty to some extent jealous of each other and now lacking the supreme direction of an admiral general the war began by a series of english successes and of dutch misfortunes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2264,1081-125237-0042,all of them being captured or burnt while blake with the main force off the north coast of scotland destroyed the dutch fishing fleet and their convoy after these first blows against the enemy's commerce good fortune continued to attend the english,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2265,1081-125237-0043,tromp was prevented from following blake by strong northerly winds he then turned upon ayscue whose small force he must have overwhelmed but for a sudden change to a southerly gale the dutch admiral now sailed northwards and july twenty fifth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2266,1081-125237-0044,found the english fleet off the shetlands a violent storm arose from the force of which blake was protected while the dutch vessels were scattered far and wide on the following day out of ninety nine ships tromp could only collect thirty five,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2268,1081-125237-0046,ayscue had previously sailed up channel with forty men of war and five fireships for a similar purpose the two fleets met on august sixteenth and despite his inferiority of force de ruyter forced ayscue to withdraw into plymouth and was able to bring his convoy home to safety,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2269,1081-125237-0047,the ill success of tromp though he was in no way to blame for it caused considerable alarm and discontent in holland his enemies of the states party in that province took advantage of it to suspend the gallant old seaman from his command he was an orangist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2270,1081-125237-0048,and as the orange partisans were everywhere clamorously active the admiral was suspect in his place cornelisz witte de with was appointed a capable sailor but disliked in the fleet as much as tromp was beloved de with effected a junction with de ruyter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2271,1081-125237-0049,and with joint forces they attacked blake on october eighth near the shoal known as the kentish knock the english fleet was considerably more powerful than the dutch and the desertion of de with by some twenty ships decided the issue the dutch had to return home with some loss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2272,1081-125237-0050,but they were deceived in thinking that the struggle in the channel was over for the winter the deserters at the kentish knock were punished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2273,1081-125237-0051,full of resentment though he was at the bad treatment he had received tromp was too good a patriot to refuse at the end of november the old admiral at the head of one hundred warships put to sea for the purpose of convoying some four hundred fifty merchantmen through the straits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2274,1081-125237-0052,stormy weather compelled him to send the convoy with an escort into shelter but he himself with sixty ships set out to seek the english fleet which lay in the downs after some manoeuvring the two fleets met on december tenth off dungeness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2275,1081-125237-0053,while many english prizes were captured this state of things was however not to last long towards the end of february sixteen fifty three blake put to sea with nearly eighty ships and on the twenty fifth off portland met tromp at the head of a force nearly equal to his own in number,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2276,1081-125237-0054,and he had moreover been at sea without replenishment of stores ever since the fight at dungeness while the english had come straight from port the fight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2277,1081-125237-0055,had lasted for two whole days when tromp found that his powder had run out and that on the third day more than half his fleet were unable to continue the struggle but inspiring his subordinates de ruyter evertsen and floriszoon with his own indomitable courage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2278,1081-125237-0056,tromp succeeded by expert seamanship in holding off the enemy and conducting his convoy with small loss into safety,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2279,1081-125237-0057,meanwhile both nations had been getting sick of the war the dutch were suffering terribly from the serious interference with their commerce and carrying trade and from the destruction of the important fisheries industry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2284,1081-125237-0062,thus early did the new council pensionary initiate a form of diplomacy in which he was to prove himself an adept this first effort was not a success the parliament published the letter with the title humble supplication of the states of holland,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2285,1081-125237-0063,he induced the states general by a bare majority four provinces to three to send a conciliatory letter the date of which april thirtieth sixteen fifty three coincided with cromwell's forcible dissolution of the rump parliament and the assumption by him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2287,1081-125237-0065,and their insistence now on the full satisfaction of all the english demands made a continuation of hostilities inevitable tromp after successfully bringing in two large convoys of merchantmen encountered june twelfth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2288,1081-125237-0066,near the gabbard the english fleet under monk and deane each fleet numbered about one hundred sail but the dutch ships were inferior in size solidity and weight of metal for two days the fight was obstinately and fiercely contested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2289,1081-125237-0067,tromp was obliged to retreat having lost twenty ships he complained bitterly as did his vice admirals de ruyter and de with to the board of admiralty of the inferiority of the vessels of his fleet as compared with those of the adversary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2290,1081-125237-0068,the english now instituted a blockade of the dutch coast which had the effect of reducing to desperate straits a land whose welfare and prosperity depended wholly on commerce amsterdam was ruined in these circumstances direct negotiation was perforce attempted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2291,1081-125237-0069,four envoys were sent representing the three maritime provinces at first it seemed impossible that any common ground of agreement could be found cromwell was obsessed with the idea of a politico religious union between the two republics which would have meant the extinction of dutch independence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2292,1081-125237-0070,una respublica which nothing but sheer conquest and dire necessity would ever induce the dutch people to accept accordingly the war went on though the envoys did not leave london hoping still that some better terms might be offered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2293,1081-125237-0071,but in order to gain breathing space for the efforts of the negotiators one thing was essential the breaking of the blockade the admiralties made a supreme effort to refit and reinforce their fleet but it lay in two portions eighty five sail under tromp in the maas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2298,1081-125237-0076,for the new ruler of england had always professed himself an opponent of the war which had shattered his fantastic dream of a union between the two republics many conferences took place but the protector's attitude and intentions were ambiguous and difficult to divine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2302,1081-125237-0080,was perfectly aware that it would be useless to present such proposals to the states general not only would they indignantly reject them but he had not the slightest hope of getting any single province even holland to allow a foreign power to interfere with their internal affairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2303,1081-125237-0081,and to bid them to treat with harsh ingratitude the infant heir of a family to which the dutch people owed so deep a debt there was nothing for it but to prepare for a vigorous resumption of the war strong efforts were therefore made at de witt's instigation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2304,1081-125237-0082,to increase the fleet and secure the active co operation of denmark and france both friendly to the states but cromwell really wanted peace and showed himself ready to yield on certain minor points but he continued to insist on the exclusion of the prince of orange,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2305,1081-125237-0083,not till the dutch envoys had demanded their passports did the protector give way so far as to say he would be content to have the exclusion guaranteed by a secret article what followed forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of diplomacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2306,1081-125237-0084,he was able to reach the private ear of cromwell and to enter into clandestine negotiations with him the council pensionary knew well the hopelessness of any attempt to get the assent of the states general to the proposed exclusion even in a secret article,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2307,1081-125237-0085,of the state of public feeling on this point with the result that the protector gave the envoy to understand that he would be satisfied if the estates of holland alone would affirm a declaration that the prince should never be appointed stadholder or captain general whether this concession was offered by cromwell proprio motu,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2308,1081-125237-0086,in any case the council pensionary being convinced of the necessity of peace resolved to secure it by playing a very deep and dangerous game not only must the whole affair be kept absolutely from the cognisance of the states general,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2309,1081-125237-0087,but also de witt was fully aware that the assent of the estates of holland to the proposed exclusion article could only be obtained with the greatest difficulty he was to prove himself a very past master in the art of diplomatic chicanery and intrigue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2310,1081-125237-0088,the council pensionary first set to work to have the treaty from which the exclusion article had been cut out ratified rapidly by the states general,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2311,1081-125237-0089,the estates adjourned for a recess on april twenty first sixteen fifty four on the following day he presented the treaty to the states general,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2312,1081-125237-0090,and such was his persuasive skill that he accomplished the unprecedented feat of getting this dilatory body to accept the conditions of peace almost without discussion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2313,1081-125237-0091,the treaty ratified and signed was sent back to london only one article aroused opposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2314,1081-125237-0092,the so called temperament clause but cromwell had insisted upon it by this article,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2315,1081-125237-0093,or commander of military or naval forces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2316,1081-125237-0094,addressed to the estates of holland not at the moment in session,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2317,1081-125237-0095,the cleverness and skill now shown by the council pensionary were truly extraordinary a summons was sent out to the estates to meet on april twenty eighth without any reason being assigned the members on assembly were sworn to secrecy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2318,1081-125237-0096,and then the official letter from london was read to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2319,1081-125237-0097,to the act of exclusion came upon the estates like a thunder bolt the sudden demand caused something like consternation and the members asked to be allowed to consider the matter with their principals before taking so momentous a decision three days were granted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2320,1081-125237-0098,but as it was essential to prevent publicity it was settled that only the burgomasters should be consulted again under oath of secrecy at the meeting on may first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2321,1081-125237-0099,that the act should be placed in his hands within two days after the ratification of the treaty was peremptory and threatening unless he received the act he would consider the treaty as not binding upon him using all his powers of advocacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2322,1081-125237-0100,de witt succeeded after an angry debate in securing a majority for the act five towns however obstinately refused their assent and claimed that it could not be passed without it but de witt had made up his mind to risk illegality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2323,1081-125237-0101,and overruled their protest the act was declared to have been passed and was on may fifth sent to van beverningh and nieuwpoort with instructions not to deliver it until circumstances compelled them to do so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2324,1081-125237-0102,but for some five weeks the existence of the act was unknown to the states general and during that period,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2325,1081-125237-0103,early in june a bribe induced one of de witt's clerks to betray the secret to count william frederick the news soon spread and loud was the outcry of the orange partisans and of the two princesses who at once addressed a remonstrance to the states general,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2326,1081-125237-0104,all the other provinces strongly protested against the action of the estates of holland and of the council pensionary de witt attempted to defend himself and the estates by vague statements avoiding the main issue but insisting that nothing illegal had been done his efforts were in vain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2327,1081-125237-0105,all the secret instructions they had received from holland and the act of exclusion meanwhile the estates of holland themselves frightened at the clamour which had been aroused began to show signs of defection,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2328,1081-125237-0106,they went so far as to pass a vote of thanks to the envoys for not having delivered the act to cromwell de witt's position appeared hopeless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2329,1081-125237-0107,his efforts to prevent the resolution of the states general from taking immediate effect proving unavailing he put forward the suggestion that on account of its importance the despatch should be sent to the envoys in cipher,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2330,1081-125237-0108,this was agreed to and on june seventh the document was duly forwarded to london by the council pensionary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2331,1081-125237-0109,informing them that the estates of holland assented to the request made by the states general and that they were to send back the secret correspondence and also the act if it were still undelivered the result answered to his expectations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2332,1081-125237-0110,while the clerk was laboriously deciphering the despatch the envoys read between the lines of de witt's letter and without a moment's delay went to whitehall and placed the act in cromwell's hands the states general had thus no alternative between acceptance of the fait accompli,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2333,1081-125237-0111,and the risk of a renewal of the war no further action was taken and the protector professed himself satisfied with a guarantee of such doubtful validity it is impossible to withhold admiration from de witt's marvellous diplomatic dexterity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2334,1081-125237-0112,and from the skill and courage with which he achieved his end in the face of obstacles and difficulties that seemed insurmountable but for the course of double dealing and chicanery by which he triumphed the only defence that can be offered is that the council pensionary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2335,1081-125237-0113,really believed that peace was an absolute necessity for his country and that peace could only be maintained at the cost of the act of exclusion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2336,1081-125237-0114,there is however every reason to believe that de witt was prompted to take the risks he did by purely patriotic motives and not through spite against the house of orange,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2337,1081-125237-0115,not merely by the orange partisans but by popular opinion generally in the united provinces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2362,1040-133433-0010,but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2363,1040-133433-0011,that is what she did hullo wendy good bye he said oh dear are you going away yes you don't feel peter she said falteringly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2364,1040-133433-0012,that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject no about me peter no missus darling came to the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2365,1040-133433-0013,would you send me to school he inquired craftily yes and then to an office i suppose so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2366,1040-133433-0014,very soon i don't want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her passionately i don't want to be a man o wendy's mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard peter said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2367,1040-133433-0015,and missus darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her keep back lady,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2368,1040-133433-0016,but where are you going to live with tink in the house we built for wendy the fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights how lovely cried wendy so longingly that missus darling tightened her grip i thought all the fairies were dead missus darling said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2369,1040-133433-0017,because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies they live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2370,1040-133433-0018,i shall have tink tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded him a little tartly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2371,1040-133433-0019,tink called out from somewhere round the corner it doesn't matter peter said o peter you know it matters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2372,1040-133433-0020,may i mummy certainly not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he does so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had asked her from politeness merely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2373,1040-133433-0021,long in coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2374,1040-133433-0022,i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones you won't forget me peter will you before spring cleaning time comes of course peter promised and then he flew away he took missus darling's kiss with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2375,1040-133433-0023,the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily funny but she seemed satisfied of course all the boys went to school,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2376,1040-133433-0024,but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2377,1040-133433-0025,in time they could not even fly after their hats want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed michael believed longer than the other boys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2378,1040-133433-0026,though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2379,1040-133433-0027,she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind who is captain hook,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2380,1040-133433-0028,when she spoke of the arch enemy don't you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2381,1040-133433-0029,who is tinker bell o peter she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he was right for fairies don't live long,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2382,1040-133433-0030,but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2383,1040-133433-0031,but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops next year he did not come for her she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2384,1040-133433-0032,perhaps he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2385,1040-133433-0033,peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2386,1040-133433-0034,and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2387,1040-133433-0035,than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys wendy was grown up you need not be sorry for her she was one of the kind that likes to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2388,1040-133433-0036,all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them you may see the twins and nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2389,1040-133433-0037,you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door that used to be tootles the bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2390,1040-133433-0038,and always had an odd inquiring look,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2391,1040-133433-0039,when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2392,1040-133433-0040,who was no longer fond of stairs missus darling was now dead and forgotten there were only two beds in the nursery now jane's and her nurse's and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2393,1040-133433-0041,she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself once a week jane's nurse had her evening off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2394,1040-133433-0042,and then it was wendy's part to put jane to bed that was the time for stories it was jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own thus making a tent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2395,1040-133433-0043,i don't think i see anything to night says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation yes you do says jane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2396,1040-133433-0044,that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy ah me how time flies does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2397,1040-133433-0045,why can't you fly now mother because i am grown up dearest when people grow up they forget the way why do they forget the way because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2398,1040-133433-0046,it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly what is gay and innocent and heartless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2399,1040-133433-0047,or perhaps wendy admits she does see something i do believe she says that it is this nursery i do believe it is says jane go on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2400,1040-133433-0048,they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2401,1040-133433-0049,you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2402,1040-133433-0050,yes that was it says jane with a big breath and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2403,1040-133433-0051,yes which did you like best of all i think i liked the home under the ground best of all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2404,1040-133433-0052,what was the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing yes but alas he forgot all about me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2405,1040-133433-0053,wendy said it with a smile she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane asked one evening it was like this wendy said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2406,1040-133433-0054,trying to imitate peter's crow no it wasn't jane said gravely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2407,1040-133433-0055,jane said ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake lucky you said jane and then one night came the tragedy it was the spring of the year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2408,1040-133433-0056,wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow then the window blew open as of old,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2409,1040-133433-0057,he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth he was a little boy and she was grown up she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2410,1040-133433-0058,a big woman hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first hullo peter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2411,1040-133433-0059,she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible something inside her was crying woman woman let go of me hullo where is john he asked suddenly missing the third bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2412,1040-133433-0060,john is not here now she gasped is michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at jane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2413,1040-133433-0061,that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her peter looked hullo is it a new one yes boy or girl girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2414,1040-133433-0062,peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you of course that is why i have come he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2415,1040-133433-0063,she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass i can't come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly i'll soon teach you again o peter don't waste the fairy dust on me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2416,1040-133433-0064,what is it he cried shrinking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2417,1040-133433-0065,for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter was afraid don't turn up the light he cried she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy she was not a little girl heart broken about him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2418,1040-133433-0066,she was a grown woman smiling at it all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2419,1040-133433-0067,then she turned up the light and peter saw he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply what is it he cried again she had to tell him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2420,1040-133433-0068,i am old peter i am ever so much more than twenty i grew up long ago you promised not to i couldn't help it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2421,1040-133433-0069,no you're not yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby no she's not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2422,1040-133433-0070,of course he did not strike,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2423,1040-133433-0071,and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2424,1040-133433-0072,boy she said why are you crying peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed hullo he said hullo said jane my name is peter pan he told her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2425,1040-133433-0073,yes i know i came back for my mother he explained to take her to the neverland yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2426,1040-133433-0074,while jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy she is my mother peter explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2427,1040-133433-0075,he does so need a mother jane said yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i good bye said peter to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2428,1040-133433-0076,it was already her easiest way of moving about wendy rushed to the window no no she cried it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2429,1040-133433-0077,if only i could go with you wendy sighed you see you can't fly said jane of course in the end wendy let them fly away together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2430,1040-133433-0078,our last glimpse of her shows her at the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2431,1040-133433-0079,as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2432,1040-133433-0080,and every spring cleaning time except when he forgets peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland where she tells him stories about himself to which he listens eagerly when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peter's mother in turn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2433,2952-408-0000,jikininki once when muso kokushi,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2434,2952-408-0001,for a long time he wandered about helplessly and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night when he perceived on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun one of those little hermitages called,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2435,2952-408-0002,which are built for solitary priests it seemed to be in ruinous condition but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest from whom he begged the favor of a night's lodging,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2436,2952-408-0003,this the old man harshly refused but he directed muso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining where lodging and food could be obtained muso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2437,2952-408-0004,but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man carrying a lighted lantern entered the room respectfully saluted him and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2438,2952-408-0005,the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2439,2952-408-0006,strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2440,2952-408-0007,but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death when i came for though i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me i could have performed the service before your departure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2441,2952-408-0008,as it is i shall perform the service after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2442,2952-408-0009,then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the adjoining room having been told of the priest's kind promises came to thank him after which the master of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2443,2952-408-0010,by the rule of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are unable to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2444,2952-408-0011,all then left the house except the priest who went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp tomyo was burning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2445,2952-408-0012,the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2446,2952-408-0013,but when the hush of the night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2447,2952-408-0014,he saw that shape lift the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginning at the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2448,2952-408-0015,turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2449,2952-408-0016,and looked about the room no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverent sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2450,2952-408-0017,all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible but the law of our village as i told you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2451,2952-408-0018,and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been broken heretofore some great misfortune has followed whenever it is obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2452,2952-408-0019,then muso told of the dim and awful shape that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2453,2952-408-0020,what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time muso then inquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2454,2952-408-0021,the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village answered muso i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2455,2952-408-0022,and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2456,2952-408-0023,for it was evident that his kind hosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2457,2952-408-0024,and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2458,2952-408-0025,you need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter said muso you directed me to the village yonder where i was very kindly treated and i thank you for that favor i can give no man shelter the recluse made answer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2459,2952-408-0026,so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rites only as a matter of business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2460,2952-408-0027,i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and because of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2461,2952-408-0028,since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverend sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2462,2952-408-0029,help me by your prayers i entreat you so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2463,2952-407-0000,even to day in the courts of certain japanese temples you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose the largest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the jodo sect at hakata in kyushu,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2464,2952-407-0001,who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for bell metal but afterwards she much regretted her mirror she remembered things that her mother had told her about it and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her mother but to her mother's mother and grandmother and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2465,2952-407-0002,but she had not the money necessary whenever she went to the temple she saw her mirror lying in the court yard behind a railing among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together she knew it by the sho chiku bai in relief on the back of it those three fortunate emblems of pine bamboo and plumflower,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2466,2952-407-0003,which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and hide it that she might thereafter treasure it always but the chance did not come and she became very unhappy felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2467,2952-407-0004,a saying mystically expressed by the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2468,2952-407-0005,evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving she had not presented her offering with all her heart and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to the mirror kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2469,2952-407-0006,of course everybody heard of the matter and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt and because of this public exposure of her secret fault the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry and as she could not bear the shame she drowned herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2470,2952-407-0007,after having written a farewell letter containing these words when i am dead it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell but to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it great wealth will be given by the ghost of me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2471,2952-407-0008,but the bell proved to be a good bell and it bravely withstood their assaults nevertheless the people were not easily discouraged day after day at all hours they continued to ring the bell furiously caring nothing whatever for the protests of the priests,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2472,2952-407-0009,so the ringing became an affliction and the priests could not endure it and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp the swamp was deep and swallowed it up and that was the end of the bell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2473,2952-407-0010,or bell of mugen now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied though not described by the verb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2474,2952-407-0011,the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2475,2952-407-0012,to compare to liken but the esoteric meaning is to substitute in imagination one object or action for another so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2476,2952-407-0013,for example you cannot afford to build a buddhist temple but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2477,2952-407-0014,you cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy one volumes of the buddhist texts but you can make a revolving library containing them turn round by pushing it like a windlass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2478,2952-407-0015,so much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazoraeru the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples but for present purposes the following will serve if you should make a little man of straw,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2479,2952-407-0016,for the same reason that sister helen made a little man of wax and nail it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2480,2952-407-0017,that would illustrate one signification of nazoraeru or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2481,2952-407-0018,the soles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed and will allow him no rest until he returns of his own accord to put himself at your mercy that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazoraeru,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2482,2952-407-0019,after the bell had been rolled into the swamp there was of course no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2483,2952-407-0020,but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble one of these persons was a woman called umegae,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2484,2952-407-0021,while the pair were traveling together kajiwara one day found himself in great straits for want of money and umegae remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2485,2952-407-0022,crying out at the same time for three hundred pieces of gold a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2486,2952-407-0023,afterwards a song was made about umegae's basin of bronze and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day umegae no chozubachi tataite,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2487,2952-407-0024,if by striking upon the wash basin of umegae i could make honorable money come to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2488,2952-407-0025,became great and many people followed the example of umegae thereby hoping to emulate her luck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2489,2952-407-0026,as it deserves to be answered take therefore this jar so saying she put the jar into his hands and disappeared into his house the happy man rushed to tell his wife the good news he set down in front of her the covered jar which was heavy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2490,2952-407-0027,and they opened it together and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2491,2952-410-0000,all the capacities of a daring and skillful soldier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2492,2952-410-0001,but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone and as his heart remained true to his former lord he preferred to give up the world so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest taking the buddhist name of kwairyo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2493,2952-410-0002,as in other years he had laughed at peril so now also he scorned danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2494,2952-410-0003,so he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside he lay down there and prepared to sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2495,2952-410-0004,he had always welcomed discomfort and even a bare rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow his body was iron and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2496,2952-410-0005,scarcely had he lain down when a man came along the road carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood this woodcutter halted on seeing kwairyo lying down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2497,2952-410-0006,and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of great surprise what kind of a man can you be good sir that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this there are haunters about here many of them are you not afraid of hairy things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2498,2952-410-0007,my friend cheerfully answered kwairyo i am only a wandering priest a cloud and water guest as folks call it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2499,2952-410-0008,as for lonesome places i like them they are suitable for meditation i am accustomed to sleeping in the open air and i have learned never to be anxious about my life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2500,2952-410-0009,to lie down here this place has a bad name a very bad name but as the proverb has it kunshi ayayuki ni chikayorazu the superior man does not needlessly expose himself to peril,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2501,2952-410-0010,and i must assure you sir that it is very dangerous to sleep here therefore although my house is only a wretched thatched hut let me beg of you to come home with me at once in the way of food i have nothing to offer you but there is a roof at least and you can sleep under it without risk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2502,2952-410-0011,accepted this modest offer the woodcutter guided him along a narrow path leading up from the main road through mountain forest it was a rough and dangerous path sometimes skirting precipices sometimes offering nothing but a network of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2503,2952-410-0012,slippery roots for the foot to rest upon sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock but at last kwairyo found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead and he saw before him a small thatched cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2504,2952-410-0013,and they must have been taught by some one well acquainted with the rules of propriety then turning to his host the aruji or house master as the others called him kwairyo said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2505,2952-410-0014,from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household i imagine that you have not always been a woodcutter perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes smiling the woodcutter answered sir you are not mistaken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2506,2952-410-0015,though now living as you find me i was once a person of some distinction my story is the story of a ruined life ruined by my own fault i used to be in the service of a daimyo and my rank in that service was not inconsiderable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2507,2952-410-0016,but i loved women and wine too well and under the influence of passion i acted wickedly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2508,2952-410-0017,retribution followed me and i long remained a fugitive in the land now i often pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did and to reestablish the ancestral home but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2509,2952-410-0018,kwairyo was pleased by this announcement of good resolve and he said to the aruji my friend i have had occasion to observe that man prone to folly in their youth may in after years become very earnest in right living,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2510,2952-410-0019,in the holy sutras it is written that those strongest in wrong doing can become by power of good resolve the strongest in right doing i do not doubt that you have a good heart and i hope that better fortune will come to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2511,2952-410-0020,to night i shall recite the sutras for your sake and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors with these assurances kwairyo bade the aruji good night and his host showed him to a very small side room where a bed had been made ready,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2512,2952-410-0021,then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sutras by the light of a paper lantern until a late hour he continued to read and pray,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2513,2952-410-0022,the night was beautiful there was no cloud in the sky there was no wind and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of foliage and glittered on the dews of the garden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2514,2952-410-0023,and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night kwairyo felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2515,2952-410-0024,very gently he pushed apart the sliding screens that separated his room from the main apartment and he saw by the light of the lantern five recumbent bodies without heads,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2516,2952-410-0025,for one instant he stood bewildered imagining a crime but in another moment he perceived that there was no blood and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut then he thought to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2517,2952-410-0026,and remove the body to another place the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck and the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved it will strike itself upon the floor three times bounding like a ball and will pant as in great fear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2518,2952-410-0027,and presently die now if these be rokuro kubi they mean me no good so i shall be justified in following the instructions of the book he seized the body of the aruji by the feet pulled it to the window and pushed it out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2519,2952-410-0028,gently unbarring the door he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it he heard voices talking in the grove and he went in the direction of the voices stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2520,2952-410-0029,then from behind a trunk he caught sight of the heads all five of them flitting about and chatting as they flitted they were eating worms and insects which they found on the ground or among the trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2521,2952-410-0030,presently the head of the aruji stopped eating and said ah that traveling priest who came to night how fat all his body is when we shall have eaten him our bellies will be well filled i was foolish to talk to him as i did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2522,2952-410-0031,to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2523,2952-410-0032,another head the head of a young woman immediately rose up and flitted to the house lightly as a bat after a few minutes it came back and cried out huskily in a tone of great alarm that traveling priest is not in the house he is gone but that is not the worst of the matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2524,2952-410-0033,he has taken the body of our aruji and i do not know where he has put it at this announcement the head of the aruji distinctly visible in the moonlight assumed a frightful aspect its eyes opened monstrously its hair stood up bristling and its teeth gnashed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2525,2952-410-0034,since my body has been moved to rejoin it is not possible then i must die and all through the work of that priest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2526,2952-410-0035,and there he is behind that tree hiding behind that tree see him the fat coward in the same moment the head of the aruji followed by the other four heads sprang at kwairyo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2527,2952-410-0036,but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree and with that tree he struck the heads as they came knocking them from him with tremendous blows four of them fled away but the head of the aruji though battered again and again desperately continued to bound at the priest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2528,2952-410-0037,and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe kwairyo however as quickly gripped the head by its topknot and repeatedly struck it it did not release its hold but it uttered a long moan and thereafter ceased to struggle it was dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2529,2952-410-0038,but its teeth still held the sleeve and for all his great strength kwairyo could not force open the jaws with the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house and there caught sight of the other four rokuro kubi squatting together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2530,2952-410-0039,with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies but when they perceived him at the back door all screamed the priest the priest and fled through the other doorway out into the woods eastward the sky was brightening day was about to dawn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2531,2952-410-0040,and kwairyo knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all fouled with blood and foam and clay and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2532,2952-410-0041,after which he gathered together his few belongings and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey right on he journeyed until he came to suwa,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2533,2952-410-0042,seized the priest and took him to jail for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who in the moment of being killed had caught the murderer's sleeve in his teeth as the kwairyo he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2534,2952-410-0043,so after having passed a night in prison he was brought before the magistrates of the district then he was ordered to explain how he a priest had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2535,2952-410-0044,kwairyo laughed long and loudly at these questions and then he said sirs i did not fasten the head to my sleeve it fastened itself there much against my will and i have not committed any crime for this is not the head of a man it is the head of a goblin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2536,2952-410-0045,but the magistrates did not laugh they judged him to be a hardened criminal and his story an insult to their intelligence therefore without further questioning they decided to order his immediate execution all of them except one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2537,2952-410-0046,a very old man this aged officer had made no remark during the trial but after having heard the opinion of his colleagues he rose up and said let us first examine the head carefully for this i think has not yet been done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2538,2952-410-0047,the old man turned it round and round carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters he called the attention of his colleagues to these and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2539,2952-410-0048,on the contrary the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem then said the elder i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth this is the head of a rokuro kubi,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2659,2691-156745-0036,i being the smallest child was given the shortest stick and allowed to stand nearest the fire soon the three slices were sizzling and browning from the ends of three willow rods and smelled so good that we could hardly wait for them to be done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2660,2691-156745-0037,then led us to the house where a number of persons had gathered most of them sitting at table laughing and talking and among them elitha and leanna upon our entrance the merriment ceased and all eyes were turned inquiringly toward us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2661,2691-156745-0038,some one pointed to him who sat beside our eldest sister and gayly said look at your new brother another asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2662,2691-156745-0039,tears came also to the child wife's eyes as she clasped her arms about us soothingly assuring us that she was still our sister and would care for us nevertheless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2663,2691-156745-0040,she and her husband slipped away soon on horseback and we were told that we were to stay at our neighbor's until they returned for us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2664,2691-156745-0041,and some in their eagerness forgot to roll down their sleeves before they began to talk one triumphantly repeated to each newcomer the motherly advice which she gave the young couple when she first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2665,2691-156745-0042,noticed his affection for that sorrowing girl who is too pretty to be in this new country without a protector they also recalled how perry mc coon's launch had brought supplies up the river for the second relief to take over the mountains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2666,2691-156745-0043,and how finally he himself had carried to the bereaved daughter the last accounts from donner camp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2667,2691-156745-0044,would she take us three to live with her on that cattle ranch twenty five miles by bridle trail from the fort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2668,8609-283227-0000,he and another farmer his neighbour had been so often re elected churchwardens that at last they seemed to have gained a prescriptive right to the office and the form of election fell into disuse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2669,8609-283227-0001,been said about the election of a colleague so little seemed to fall to the duty of the churchwarden that i regarded the neglect as a trifle and was remiss in setting it right i had therefore to suffer as was just indeed mister brownrigg was not the man to have power in his hands unchecked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2670,8609-283227-0002,i had so far recovered that i was able to rise about noon and go into my study though i was very weak and had not yet been out when one morning missus pearson came into the room and said please sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2671,8609-283227-0003,confident there must be a good reason for it and so told missus pearson to show him in oh sir i know you would be vexed if you hadn't been told he exclaimed and i am sure you will not be angry with me for troubling you what is the matter tom i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2672,8609-283227-0004,which were necessary and must be done before another winter i confess i was rather pleased for i wanted my people to feel that the church was their property and that it was their privilege if they could regard it as a blessing to have the church to keep it in decent order and repair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2673,8609-283227-0005,to my churchwarden we must call a vestry before long and have this looked to now my predecessor had left everything of the kind to his churchwardens and the inhabitants from their side had likewise left the whole affair to the churchwardens but mister brownrigg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2674,8609-283227-0006,who i must say had taken more pains than might have been expected of him to make himself acquainted with the legalities of his office did not fail to call a vestry to which as usual no one had responded whereupon he imposed a rate according to his own unaided judgment this i believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2675,8609-283227-0007,he did during my illness with the notion of pleasing me by the discovery that the repairs had been already effected according to my mind nor did any one of my congregation throw the least difficulty in the churchwarden's way and now i must refer to another circumstance in the history of my parish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2676,8609-283227-0008,there was a little chapel down a lane leading from the main street of the village in which there was service three times every sunday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2677,8609-283227-0009,amongst whom were the families of two or three farmers of substance while the village and its neighbourhood contributed a portion of the poorest of the inhabitants a year or two before i came their minister died and they had chosen another a very worthy man of considerable erudition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2678,8609-283227-0010,but of extreme views as i heard upon insignificant points and moved by a great dislike to national churches and episcopacy this i say is what i had made out about him from what i had heard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2679,8609-283227-0011,and my reader will very probably be inclined to ask but why with principles such as yours should you have only hearsay to go upon why did you not make the honest man's acquaintance in such a small place men should not keep each other at arm's length,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2680,8609-283227-0012,and any reader who says so will say right all i have to suggest for myself is simply a certain shyness for which i cannot entirely account but which was partly made up of fear to intrude or of being supposed to arrogate to myself the right of making advances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2681,8609-283227-0013,partly of a dread lest we should not be able to get on together and so the attempt should result in something unpleasantly awkward i daresay likewise that the natural shelliness of the english had something to do with it at all events i had not made his acquaintance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2682,8609-283227-0014,mister templeton then had refused as a point of conscience to pay the church rate when the collector went round to demand it had been summoned before a magistrate in consequence had suffered a default and proceedings being pushed from the first in all the pride of mister brownrigg's legality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2683,8609-283227-0015,had on this very day been visited by the churchwarden accompanied by a broker from the neighbouring town of addicehead and at the very time when i was hearing of the fact was suffering distraint of his goods the porcine head of the churchwarden was not on his shoulders by accident nor without significance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2684,8609-283227-0016,but i did not wait to understand all this now it was enough for me that tom bore witness to the fact that at that moment proceedings were thus driven to extremity i rang the bell for my boots and to the open mouthed dismay of missus pearson left the vicarage leaning on tom's arm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2685,8609-283227-0017,but such was the commotion in my mind that i had become quite unconscious of illness or even feebleness hurrying on in more terror than i can well express lest i should be too late i reached mister templeton's house just as a small mahogany table was being hoisted into a spring cart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2686,8609-283227-0018,which stood at the door breathless with haste i was yet able to call out put that table down directly at the same moment mister brownrigg appeared from within the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2687,8609-283227-0019,i think he had not heard me you see i'm prompt mister walton he said but bless my soul how ill you look without answering him for i was more angry with him than i ought to have been i repeated put that table down i tell you they did so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2688,8609-283227-0020,now i said carry it back into the house why sir interposed mister brownrigg it's all right yes i said as right as the devil would have it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2689,8609-283227-0021,i'm not so sure of that i believe i had the right to be chairman at the vestry meeting but instead of even letting me know you took advantage of my illness to hurry on matters to this shameful and wicked excess i did the poor man wrong in this for i believe he had hurried things really to please me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2690,8609-283227-0022,his face had lengthened considerably by this time and its rubicund hue declined i did not think you would stand upon ceremony about it sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2691,8609-283227-0023,before such a thing should have happened i feel so disgraced i am ashamed to look mister templeton in the face carry that table into the house again directly it's my property now interposed the broker i've bought it of the churchwarden and paid for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2692,8609-283227-0024,but i tell you the whole affair is illegal and if you carry away that table i shall see what the law will do for me i assure you i will prosecute you myself you take up that money or i will it will go to pay counsel i give you my word if you do not take it to quench strife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2693,8609-283227-0025,i stretched out my hand but the broker was before me without another word he pocketed the money jumped into his cart with his man and drove off leaving the churchwarden and the parson standing at the door of the dissenting minister with his mahogany table on the path between them now mister brownrigg i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2694,8609-283227-0026,lend me a hand to carry this table in again he yielded not graciously that could not be expected but in silence oh sir interposed young tom who had stood by during the dispute let me take it you're not able to lift it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2695,8609-283227-0027,and so mister brownrigg and i blundered into the little parlour with our burden not a great one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2696,8609-283227-0028,mister templeton sat in a windsor chair in the middle of the room evidently the table had been carried away from before him leaving his position uncovered the floor was strewed with the books which had lain upon it he sat reading an old folio as if nothing had happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2697,8609-283227-0029,but when we entered he rose he was a man of middle size about forty with short black hair and overhanging bushy eyebrows his mouth indicated great firmness not unmingled with sweetness and even with humour he smiled as he rose but looked embarrassed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2698,8609-283227-0030,glancing first at the table then at me and then at mister brownrigg as if begging somebody to tell him what to say but i did not leave him a moment in this perplexity mister templeton i said quitting the table and holding out my hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2699,8609-283227-0031,that you should have been annoyed like this i have mister templeton interrupted me i assure you it was a matter of conscience with me he said on no other ground i know it i know it i said interrupting him in my turn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2700,8609-283227-0032,i beg your pardon and i have done my best to make amends for it offences must come you know mister templeton but i trust i have not incurred the woe that follows upon them by means of whom they come for i knew nothing of it and indeed was too ill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2701,8609-283227-0033,mister brownrigg i spoke in heat when i came up to you and i am sure i did you wrong i am certain you had no improper motive in not making me acquainted with your proceedings you meant no harm to me but you did very wrong towards mister templeton i will try to show you that when i am well again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2702,8609-283227-0034,but but you mustn't talk more now said doctor duncan so i shook hands with mister brownrigg and we parted i fear from what i know of my churchwarden that he went home with the conviction that he had done perfectly right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2703,8609-283227-0035,and amongst them by mister templeton and here i may as well sketch the result of that strange introduction to the dissenting minister,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2704,8609-283227-0036,the gist of the letter lay in these words i confess it perplexes me to understand how to reconcile your christian and friendly behaviour to one whom most of your brethren would consider as much beneath their notice as inferior to them in social position,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2705,8609-283227-0037,with your remaining the minister of a church in which such enormities as you employed your private influence to counteract in my case are not only possible but certainly lawful and recognized by most of its members as likewise expedient to this i replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2706,8609-283227-0038,my dear sir i do not like writing letters especially on subjects of importance there are a thousand chances of misunderstanding whereas in a personal interview there is a possibility of controversy being hallowed by communion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2707,8609-283227-0039,to missus templeton for not inviting her with you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2708,8609-283227-0040,how you could belong to a church which authorizes things of which you yourself so heartily disapprove and i answer you i returned that just to such a church our lord belonged i do not quite understand you our lord belonged to the jewish church,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2709,8609-283227-0041,i want if you will allow me to show you the principle upon which he acted with regard to church rates certainly i beg your pardon for interrupting you the pharisees demanded a tribute which it is allowed was for the support of the temple and its worship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2710,8609-283227-0042,our lord did not refuse to acknowledge their authority notwithstanding the many ways in which they had degraded the religious observances of the jewish church he acknowledged himself a child of the church but said that as a child he ought to have been left to contribute as he pleased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2711,8609-283227-0043,to the support of its ordinances and not to be compelled after such a fashion there i have you exclaimed mister templeton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2712,8609-283227-0044,i grant it it is entirely wrong a very unchristian proceeding but our lord did not therefore desert the church as you would have me do he paid the money lest he should offend and not having it of his own he had to ask his father for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2713,8609-283227-0045,or what came to the same thing make a servant of his father namely a fish in the sea of galilee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2714,8609-283227-0046,it is wrong to compel and wrong to refuse the payment of a church rate i do not say equally wrong it is much worse to compel than to refuse you are very generous returned mister templeton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2715,8609-283227-0047,may i hope that you will do me the credit to believe that if i saw clearly that they were the same thing i would not hesitate a moment to follow our lord's example i believe it perfectly therefore however we may differ we are in reality at no strife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2716,8609-283227-0048,but is there not this difference that our lord was as you say a child of the jewish church which was indubitably established by god now if i cannot conscientiously belong to the so called english church why should i have to pay church rate or tribute,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2717,8609-283227-0049,shall i tell you the argument the english church might then use the church might say then you are a stranger and no child therefore like the kings of the earth we may take tribute of you so you see it would come to this that dissenters alone should be compelled to pay church rates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2718,8609-283227-0050,we both laughed at this pushing of the argument to illegitimate conclusions then i resumed but the real argument is that not for such faults should we separate from each other not for such faults or any faults so long as it is the repository of the truth should you separate from the church,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2719,8609-283227-0051,i will yield the point when you can show me the same ground for believing the church of england the national church appointed such by god that i can show you and you know already for receiving the jewish church as the appointment of god,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2720,8609-283227-0052,that would involve a long argument upon which though i have little doubt upon the matter myself i cannot say i am prepared to enter at this moment meantime i would just ask you whether you are not sufficiently a child of the church of england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2721,8609-283227-0053,having received from it a thousand influences for good if in no other way yet through your fathers to find it no great hardship and not very unreasonable to pay a trifle to keep in repair one of the tabernacles in which our forefathers worshipped together if,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2722,8609-283227-0054,as i hope you will allow in some imperfect measure god is worshipped and the truth is preached in it most willingly would i pay the money i object simply because the rate is compulsory and therein you have our lord's example to the contrary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2723,8609-283227-0055,a silence followed for i had to deal with an honest man who was thinking i resumed a thousand difficulties will no doubt come up to be considered in the matter do not suppose i am anxious to convince you i believe that our father our elder brother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2724,8609-283227-0056,and the spirit that proceedeth from them is teaching you as i believe i too am being taught by the same why then should i be anxious to convince you of anything will you not in his good time come to see what he would have you see,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2725,8609-283227-0057,i am relieved to speak my mind knowing he would have us speak our minds to each other but i do not want to proselytize if you change your mind you will probably do so on different grounds from any i give you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2726,8609-283227-0058,and i haven't been to a university like you but i'm no fool either i hope don't be offended at my question wouldn't you be glad to see me out of your parish now i began to speak but he went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2727,8609-283227-0059,don't you regard me as an interloper now one who has no right to speak because he does not belong to the church god forbid i answered if a word of mine would make you leave my parish to morrow i dare not say it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2728,8609-283227-0060,i do not want to incur the rebuke of our lord for surely the words forbid him not involved some rebuke would it not be a fearful thing that one soul because of a deed of mine should receive a less portion of elevation or comfort in his journey towards his home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2729,8609-283227-0061,are there not countless modes of saying the truth you have some of them i hope i have some,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2730,8609-283227-0062,who will not hear me preach to them in the name and love of god mister templeton speak that you do know and testify that you have seen you and i will help each other in proportion as we serve the master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2731,8609-283227-0063,i only say that in separating from us you are in effect and by your conduct saying to us do not preach for you follow not with us i will not be guilty of the same towards you your fathers did the church no end of good by leaving it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2732,8609-283227-0064,but it is time to unite now once more followed a silence if people could only meet and look each other in the face said mister templeton at length they might find there was not such a gulf between them as they had fancied and so we parted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2733,8609-283227-0065,now i do not write all this for the sake of the church rate question i write it to commemorate the spirit in which mister templeton met me for it is of consequence that two men who love their master should recognize each that the other does so and thereupon if not before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2734,8609-283227-0066,and many a time ere his death we consulted together about things that befell once he came to me about a legal difficulty in connexion with the deed of trust of his chapel and although i could not help him myself i directed him to such help as was thorough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2735,8609-283227-0067,and cost him nothing i need not say he never became a churchman or that i never expected he would all his memories of a religious childhood all the sources of the influences which had refined and elevated him were surrounded with other associations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2736,8609-283227-0068,than those of the church and her forms the church was his grandmother not his mother and he had not made any acquaintance with her till comparatively late in life but while i do not say that his intellectual objections to the church were less strong than they had been,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2737,8609-283227-0069,i am sure that his feelings were moderated even changed towards her and though this may seem of no consequence to one who loves the church more than the brotherhood it does not seem of little consequence to me who love the church because of the brotherhood of which it is the type and the restorer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2738,8609-283227-0070,it was long before another church rate was levied in marshmallows and when the circumstance did take place no one dreamed of calling on mister templeton for his share in it but having heard of it he called himself upon the churchwarden mister brownrigg still and offered the money cheerfully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2739,8609-262281-0000,chapter sixteen much to alter at the same moment constance channing was traversing the boundaries on her way to lady augusta yorke's where she had some days since commenced her duties it took her scarcely two minutes to get there for the houses were almost within view of each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2740,8609-262281-0001,constance would willingly have commenced the daily routine at an earlier hour lady augusta freely confessed that to come earlier would be useless for she could not get her daughters up strictly speaking lady augusta did not personally try to get them up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2741,8609-262281-0002,preparing their lessons fanny came running in her hair in curl papers some bread and butter in her hand carry has not finished her breakfast miss channing quoth she she was lazy this morning i think some one else was lazy also said constance gently drawing the child to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2742,8609-262281-0003,why did you come down half dressed my dear i am quite dressed responded fanny my frock's on and so is my pinafore and these said constance touching the curl papers oh martha got up late and said she had no time to take them out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2743,8609-262281-0004,constance rang the bell martha who was the only maid kept except the cook appeared in answer to it lady augusta was wont to say that she had too much expense with her boys to keep many servants and the argument was a true one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2744,8609-262281-0005,be so kind as to take the papers out of miss fanny's hair and let it be done in future martha before she comes to me gently as the words were spoken there was no mistaking that the tone was one of authority and not to be trifled with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2745,8609-262281-0006,martha withdrew with the child and just then caroline came in full of eagerness miss channing mamma says she shall take one of us to the missionary meeting whichever you choose to fix upon mind you fix upon me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2746,8609-262281-0007,some of the anecdotes are beautiful who told you they were asked caroline mister yorke replied constance a pretty blush rising to her cheek he knows the lecturer well you would be pleased to hear them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2747,8609-262281-0008,it is not for that i wish to go said caroline i think meetings where there's nothing but talking are the dullest things in the world if i were to listen it would send me to sleep then why do you wish so much to attend this one because i shall wear my new dress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2748,8609-262281-0009,i have not had it on yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2749,8609-262281-0010,i was in such a passion constance wondered where she should begin there was so much to do so much to alter in so many ways to set to work abruptly would never answer it must be commenced gradually almost imperceptibly little by little caroline,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2750,8609-262281-0011,in what way miss channing did i not request you to have that exercise written out i know said caroline with some contrition i intended to write it out this morning before you came but somehow i lay in bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2751,8609-262281-0012,would you undertake to get up and be ready for me asked constance caroline drew a long face she did not speak my dear you are fifteen well responded caroline,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2752,8609-262281-0013,deficient in many ways caroline in goodness in thoughtfulness and in other desirable qualities and greatly so in education annabel who is a year younger than you is twice as advanced annabel says you worry her into learning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2753,8609-262281-0014,annabel is fond of talking nonsense but she is a good loving child at heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2754,8609-262281-0015,i have so much to teach you caroline to your mind and heart as well as to your intellect that i feel the hours as at present arranged will be insufficient for me my dear when you grow up to womanhood i am sure you will wish to be loving and loved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2755,8609-262281-0016,caroline burst into tears i should do better if mamma were not so cross with me miss channing i always do anything that william yorke asks me and i will do anything for you constance kissed her then will you begin by rising early and being ready for me at seven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2756,8609-262281-0017,are you going to the meeting this afternoon of course not said constance my time now belongs to you but i think mamma wishes you to go with us she said something about it does she i should very much like to go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2757,8609-262281-0018,lady augusta came in and proffered the invitation to constance to accompany them constance then spoke of giving the children the extra two hours from seven to nine it was really necessary she said if she was to do her duty by them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2758,8609-262281-0019,you will never put up with our scrambling breakfast miss channing the boys are so unruly and i do not get up to it half my time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2759,8609-262281-0020,not very early answered constance hitherto i have risen at seven summer and winter dressing and reading takes me just an hour for the other hour i find plenty of occupation we do not breakfast until nine on account of tom and charley i shall rise at six now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2760,8609-262281-0021,and come here at seven very well said lady augusta i suppose this will only apply to the summer months one of the girls shall go with us to day whichever deserves it best you are not leaving one of them at home to make room for me i hope lady augusta,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2761,8609-262281-0022,not at all answered lady augusta i never chaperon two children to a crowded meeting people might say they took up the room of grown up persons you will let me go not caroline miss channing pleaded fanny when her mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2762,8609-262281-0023,no said caroline sharply miss channing will fix upon me i shall obey lady augusta,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2763,8609-262281-0024,it will be only right to do so suppose we are both good and merit it equally suggested fanny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2764,8609-262281-0025,you must not be disappointed if in that case i give the privilege to caroline as being the elder of the two but i will make it up to you in some other way alas for poor caroline's resolution for a short time an hour or so she did strive to do her best,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2765,8609-262281-0026,but then good resolutions were forgotten and idleness followed not only idleness temper also,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2766,8609-262281-0027,she even forgot herself so far as to be insolent fanny was taken to the meeting you saw her in the carriage when lady augusta drove to mister galloway's office and persuaded hamish to join them caroline was left at home in a state of open rebellion with the lessons to learn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2767,8609-262281-0028,which she had not learnt in the day how shall you get on with them constance the rev william yorke inquired of her that same evening have the weeds destroyed the good seed not quite destroyed it replied constance though she sighed sadly as she spoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2768,8609-262281-0029,there is so much ill to undo caroline is the worst the weeds with her have had longer time to get ahead i think perhaps if i could keep her wholly with me for a twelvemonth or so watching over her constantly a great deal might be effected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2769,8609-262281-0030,if that anticipated living would fall in which seems very far away in the clouds and you were wholly mine we might have caroline with us for a time laughed mister yorke constance laughed too do not be impatient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2770,8609-262281-0031,or it will seem to be further off still it will come william they had been speaking in an undertone standing together at a window apart from the rest mister channing was lying on his sofa underneath the other window and now spoke to mister yorke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2772,8609-262281-0033,i have heard so his complaint was rheumatism very much as i fancy the same sort of rheumatism that afflicts you he told me he came to europe with very little hope he feared his complaint had become chronic and incurable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2773,8609-262281-0034,but he has been restored in a wonderful manner and is in sound health again and what remedies did he use eagerly asked mister channing a three months residence at some medicinal springs in germany nothing else when i say nothing else of course i must imply that he was under medical treatment there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2774,8609-262281-0035,it is the very thing you see sir that has been ordered for you ay sighed mister channing feeling how very faint appeared to be the hope that he should have the opportunity of trying it i was mentioning your case to him observed mister yorke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2775,8609-262281-0036,the channings themselves were silent they could not see the way at all clear when mister yorke was leaving he beckoned constance and arthur into the hall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2777,8609-262281-0038,arthur did not feel hopeful indeed his heart sank within him the whole time that they were talking hamish and his difficulties were the dark shadow though he could not tell this to mister yorke were mister channing to go abroad and the arrest of hamish to follow upon it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2778,8609-262281-0039,doctor lamb says the cost was so trifling as scarcely to be credited continued mister yorke in a tone of remonstrance arthur don't you care to help to save him i would move heaven and earth to save my father impulsively spoke arthur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2779,8609-262281-0040,stung by the implied reproof i should not care what labour it cost me to procure the money so that i succeeded we all would said constance you must know we would william from hamish downwards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2780,8609-262281-0041,did you think i was lost i was seduced into joining your missionary meeting people and have had to stop late at the office to make up for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2781,8609-262281-0042,fresh hope seems to arise daily that those german baths would restore him to health they cured doctor lamb i say hamish that the money must be found for it somehow added mister yorke found of course it shall be found cried gay hamish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2782,8609-262281-0043,i intend to be a chief contributor to it myself but his joking words and careless manner jarred at that moment upon the spirit both of arthur and constance channing why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2783,7402-59171-0000,mister shaw came for a short time recently to be regarded less as an author than as an incident in the european war in the opinion of many people it seemed as if the allies were fighting against a combination composed of germany,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2784,7402-59171-0001,and he does express an opinion on everything without making a multitude of people shake their fists in impotent anger his life at least his public life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2785,7402-59171-0002,he has gone about like a pickpocket of illusions from the world of literature to the world of morals and from the world of morals to the world of politics and everywhere he has gone an innumerable growl has followed him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2786,7402-59171-0003,not that he has not had his disciples men and women who believe that what mister shaw says on any conceivable subject is far more important than what the times or the manchester guardian says he has never founded a church however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2787,7402-59171-0004,because he has always been able to laugh at his disciples as unfeelingly as at anybody else he has courted unpopularity as other men have courted popularity he has refused to assume the vacuous countenance either of an idol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2788,7402-59171-0005,seems like life in ruins are filled at times with a wild lust to denounce and belittle him he has been called more names than any other man of letters alive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2789,7402-59171-0006,when all the other names have been exhausted and we are about to become inarticulate we even denounce him as a bore but this is only the billingsgate of our exasperation mister shaw is not a bore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2790,7402-59171-0007,whatever else he may be he has succeeded in the mere business of interesting us beyond any other writer of his time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2791,7402-59171-0008,probably he was doomed to be a figure just as doctor johnson was if he had not told us legends about himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2792,7402-59171-0009,in search of a ghost with its beard on fire his critics often accuse him in regard to the invention of the shaw myth of having designed a poster rather than painted a portrait,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2793,7402-59171-0010,stop advertising myself on the contrary i must do it more than ever look at pears's soap there is a solid house if you like but every wall is still plastered with their advertisements if i were to give up advertising,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2794,7402-59171-0011,my business would immediately begin to fall off you blame me for having declared myself to be the most remarkable man of my time but the claim is an arguable one why should i not say it when i believe that it is true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2795,7402-59171-0012,he is in the line of all those tramps and stage irishmen who have gone through life with so fine a swagger of words this only means that in his life he is an artist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2796,7402-59171-0013,until we realize that he is an artist not only in the invention of his own life but in the observation of the lives of other people his broadbent is as wonderful a figure as his george bernard shaw not that his portraiture is always faithful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2797,7402-59171-0014,he sees men and women too frequently in the refracting shallows of theories he is a doctrinaire and his characters are often comic statements of his doctrines rather than the reflections of men and women,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2798,7402-59171-0015,he observes in one of the many passages in which he justifies himself the audience thinks it is being made fun of in reality i am simply a very careful writer of natural history,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2799,7402-59171-0016,one is bound to contradict him mister shaw often thinks he is presenting true human nature when he is merely presenting his opinions about human nature the human nature of soldiers of artists of women or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2800,7402-59171-0017,rather when he is presenting a queer fizzing mixture of human nature and his opinions about it this may be sometimes actually a virtue in his comedy certainly from the time of aristophanes onwards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2801,7402-59171-0018,admirably true both to human nature and to mister shaw's view of the human nature of artists but when he goes on with his last breath to utter his artistic creed i believe in michael angelo velasquez and rembrandt in the might of design,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2802,7402-59171-0019,the redemption of all things by beauty everlasting and the message of art that has made these hands blessed amen amen these sentences are no more natural or naturalistic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2803,7402-59171-0020,without any admixture of humanity repeating mister shaw's opinion of the nature of the creed of artists there is a similar falsification in the same play in the characterization of the newspaper man who is present at dubedat's death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2804,7402-59171-0021,because into an atmosphere of more or less naturalistic comedy they simply introduce a farcical exaggeration of mister shaw's opinion of the incompetence and impudence of journalists mister shaw's comedies are repeatedly injured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2805,7402-59171-0022,by a hurried alteration of atmosphere in this manner comedy as well as tragedy must create some kind of illusion and the destruction of the illusion even for the sake of a joke may mean the destruction of laughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2806,7402-59171-0023,the proportion of unreality is not overwhelming it has been enormously exaggerated after all if the character of the newspaper man in the doctor's dilemma is machine made,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2807,7402-59171-0024,the much more important character of b b the soothing and incompetent doctor is a creation of the true comic genius nine people out of ten harp on mister shaw's errors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2808,7402-59171-0025,it is much more necessary that we should recognize that amid all his falsifications doctrinal and jocular he has a genuine comic sense of character most french critics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2809,7402-59171-0026,declare that bernard shaw does depict characters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2810,7402-59171-0027,moliere has never drawn a doctor more comically the doctor than paramore nor more characteristic figures of women than those in the same play the philanderer the character drawing is admirable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2811,7402-59171-0028,and the characterization in moliere in shaw's plays the characters are less representative of vices or passions than those of moliere and more representative of class profession or sect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2812,7402-59171-0029,moliere depicts the miser the jealous man the misanthrope the hypocrite whereas shaw depicts the bourgeois the rebel the capitalist the workman the socialist the doctor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2813,7402-59171-0030,a few only of these latter types are given us by moliere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2814,7402-59171-0031,of farce and so forth is a suggestive contribution to criticism i am not sure that the comparison would not have been more effectively put in a chapter than a book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2815,7402-59171-0032,is intended as a biography and general criticism of mister shaw as well as a comparison between his work and moliere's it contains it must be confessed a great deal that is not new to english readers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2816,7402-59171-0033,mister shaw is made an idol in spite of himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2817,7402-59171-0034,is an offering at a shrine the true things it contains however make it worth reading,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2818,7402-59171-0035,for instance what many critics have failed to see that in his dramatic work mister shaw is less a wit than a humorist in shaw's work we find few studied jests few epigrams even,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2819,7402-59171-0036,moliere anticipated mister shaw in outraging the sentiment for instance which has gathered round the family moliere and shaw as he puts it with quaint seriousness appear to be unaware of what a father is what a father is worth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2820,7402-59171-0037,the defence of mister shaw however does not depend on any real or imaginary resemblance of his plays to moliere's his joy and his misery before the ludicrous spectacle of human life are his own and his expression of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2821,7402-59171-0038,is his own he has studied with his own eyes the swollen bellied pretences of preachers and poets and rich men and lovers and politicians and he has derided them as they have never been derided on the english stage before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2822,7402-59171-0039,he has derided them with both an artistic and a moral energy he has brought them all into a palace of truth where they have revealed themselves with an unaccustomed and startling frankness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2823,7402-59171-0040,he has done this sometimes with all the exuberance of mirth sometimes with all the bitterness of a satirist even his bitterness is never venomous however he is genial beyond the majority of inveterate controversialists and propagandists,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2824,7402-59171-0041,he does not hesitate to wound and he does not hesitate to misunderstand but he is free from malice the geniality of his comedy on the other hand is often more offensive than malice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2825,7402-59171-0042,because it is from an orthodox point of view geniality in the wrong place it is like a grin in church a laugh at a marriage service,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2826,7402-59171-0043,that he was not intensely serious in all that he wrote about the war but his seriousness is essentially the seriousness of in the higher sense of the word the comic artist of the disillusionist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2827,7402-59171-0044,he sees current history from the absolutely opposite point of view say to the lyric poet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2828,7402-59171-0045,though his attitude to the war was as anti prussian,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2829,7402-59171-0046,a great number of people thought he must be a pro german the fact is in war time more than at any other time people dread the vision of the satirist and the sceptic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2830,7402-59171-0047,this is not to disparage mister shaw's contributions to the discussion of politics that contribution has been brilliant challenging and humane and not more wayward than the contribution of the partisan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2831,7402-59171-0048,it may be said of mister shaw that in his politics as in his plays he has sought utopia along the path of disillusion as other men have sought it along the path of idealism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2832,7402-90848-0000,once upon a time there was an old widow woman who had three sons the first two were clever enough but the third bobo by name was little better than a silly simpleton all his mother's scoldings and beatings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2833,7402-90848-0001,and she smacked the poor lad soundly a dozen times a day did him no good whatever now it came to pass that one morning princess zenza the ruler of the land happened to pass by the cottage and heard bobo being given a terrible tongue lashing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2834,7402-90848-0002,curious as to the cause of all the noise the princess drew rein and summoned bobo's mother to come near on hearing her story it occurred to the princess that so silly a lad might amuse her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2835,7402-90848-0003,now he would be sent to find a white craw's feather or a spray of yellow bluebells now he was ordered to look for a square wheel or a glass of dry water everybody laughed at him and made fun of him that is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2836,7402-90848-0004,everybody except little tilda the kitchen maid when poor bobo used to return from some wild goose chase tired out mud stained and often enough wet to the skin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2837,7402-90848-0005,instead of laughing little tilda would find him a glass of warm milk hang his coat by the fire to dry and tell him not to be such a simpleton again thus after a while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2838,7402-90848-0006,one pleasant mid summer morning when bobo had been nearly a year at the castle princess zenza overslept half an hour and did not come down to breakfast at the usual time when she did get up she found her court waiting for her in the castle gardens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2839,7402-90848-0007,shall we send bobo in search of the lost half hour said the princess to the courtiers yes yes cried the courtiers bobo shall look for the lost half hour i'll give him a horse said one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2840,7402-90848-0008,when he returned the good kitchen maid said little for she feared lest some misadventure overtake the poor simpleton but when the chief cook was not looking she tucked a fresh currant bun into bobo's pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2841,7402-90848-0009,good bye bobo cried the assembled courtiers who were almost beside themselves with laughter at the simpleton and his errand don't fail to bring back the lost half hour so bobo rode over the hills and far away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2842,7402-90848-0010,it was very dignified and wore tortoise shell glasses but bobo had to answer no and the old man wandered on again another day the simpleton encountered a tall dark fierce kind of fellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2843,7402-90848-0011,who answered his polite question with a scream of rage a half hour he roared no i have n't seen your half hour i would n't tell you if i had what's more i don't want to see it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2844,7402-90848-0012,i'm looking for something i've lost myself i've lost my temper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2845,7402-90848-0013,answer me you silly have you seen a lost temper anywhere it's about the size of a large melon and has sharp little points on bobo's answering no this dreadful person uttered so perfectly awful a screech of rage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2846,7402-90848-0014,that bobo's horse took fright and ran away with him and it was all that bobo could do to rein him in three miles farther down the road still farther along bobo came to zizz the capital city of the kingdom of the seven brooks and was taken before the king himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2847,7402-90848-0015,here the poor old king took out a great green handkerchief and wiped his eyes she was stolen by the fairies on midsummer eve fifteen years ago find her worthy bobo and an immense reward will be yours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2848,7402-90848-0016,and he continued his way on foot three long years passed and bobo grew into a handsome lad but remained a simpleton still finally after he had wandered all about fairyland he came to the edge of the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2849,7402-90848-0017,bobo asked the sailors if they had seen a lost half hour no said the sailors but we are going to the isles of iron suppose you go with us the lost half hour may be there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2850,7402-90848-0018,so bobo went aboard the ship and sailed out upon the dark sea for two days the weather was warm and clear but on the third day there came a dreadful storm and on the third night the vessel was driven far off her course into the unknown ocean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2851,7402-90848-0019,and was wrecked upon a mysterious island of rocks that shone in the night like wet matches a great wave swept the decks and bobo was borne away from his companions and carried toward the shining land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2852,7402-90848-0020,though pounded and battered by the foaming waves the simpleton at length managed to reach the beach and took refuge in a crevice of the cliff during the stormy night when the dawn broke all sign of the ship had disappeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2853,7402-90848-0021,looking about bobo found himself on a lovely island whose heart was a high mountain mass hidden in the fog still sweeping in from the sea there was not a house a road or a path to be seen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2854,7402-90848-0022,in which were a pair of wooden shoes above the shoes was a card saying simply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2855,7402-90848-0023,so bobo sat down on a stone by the foot of the tree and put on the wooden shoes which fitted him very nicely now these shoes were magic shoes and bobo had hardly stepped into them before they turned his feet inland,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2856,7402-90848-0024,so bobo obediently let the shoes guide him at corners the shoes always turned in the right direction and if bobo forgot and blundered on the wrong way the shoes swiftly began to pinch his toes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2857,7402-90848-0025,for two days bobo walked inland toward the great mountain a warm wind blew the clouds and rain away the sun shone sweet and clear on the morning of the third day the simpleton entered a wood of tall silent trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2858,7402-90848-0026,and as that day was drawing to a close turrets of a magnificent castle rose far away over the leaves of the forest bobo arrived at twilight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2859,7402-90848-0027,he found himself in a beautiful garden lying between the castle walls and the rising slopes of a great mountain strange to say not a living creature was to be seen and though there were lights in the castle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2860,7402-90848-0028,there was not even a warder at the gate suddenly a great booming bell struck seven o'clock bobo began to hear voices and sounds and then before the humming of the bell had died away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2861,7402-90848-0029,a youth mounted on a splendid black horse dashed at lightning speed out of the castle and disappeared in the wood an old man with a white beard accompanied by eleven young men whom bobo judged from their expressions to be brothers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2862,7402-90848-0030,stood by the gate to see the horseman ride away plucking up courage bobo came forward fell on his knee before the old man and told his story truly you should thank the storm fairies said the old man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2863,7402-90848-0031,for had you not been wrecked upon this island never would you have discovered the lost half hour i am father time himself and these are my twelve sons the hours every day one after the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2864,7402-90848-0032,they ride for an hour round the whole wide world seven o'clock has just ridden forth yes you shall have the lost half hour but you must look after my sons horses for the space of a whole year to this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2865,7402-90848-0033,bobo willingly agreed so twelve o'clock who was the youngest of the hours took him to the stables and showed him the little room in the turret that he was to have,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2866,7402-90848-0034,he took such good care of the great black horses of the hours of the night and the white horses of the hours of the day that they were never more proud and strong nor their coats smoother and more gleaming when the year was up bobo again sought out father time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2867,7402-90848-0035,you have served faithfully and well said father time here is your reward and with these words he placed in bobo's hands a small square casket made of ebony the half hour lies inside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2868,7402-90848-0036,don't try to peek at it or open the box until the right time has come if you do the half hour will flyaway and disappear forever farewell bobo said kind young twelve o'clock who had been the simpleton's good friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2869,7402-90848-0037,i too have a gift for thee drink this cup of water to the last drop and the youth handed the simpleton a silver cup full to the brim of clear shining water now this water was the water of wisdom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2870,7402-90848-0038,and when bobo had drunk it he was no longer a simpleton and being no longer a simpleton he remembered the man who had lost his reputation the man who had lost his temper and the king whose daughter had been stolen by the fairies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2871,7402-90848-0039,tell the first said father time that his reputation has been broken into a thousand pieces which have been picked up by his neighbors and carried home if he can persuade his neighbors to give them up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2872,7402-90848-0040,as for the missing daughter she is the kitchen maid in princess zenza's palace who is known as tilda so bobo thanked father time and at noon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2873,7402-90848-0041,twelve o'clock placed him behind him on the white charger and hurried away so fast they flew that bobo who was holding the ebony casket close against his heart was in great danger of falling off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2874,7402-90848-0042,when they got to the seashore the white horse hesitated not an instant but set foot upon the water which bore him up as if it had been not water but earth itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2875,7402-90848-0043,bobo with great goodness of heart took along this extraordinary object in the hope of finding its angry possessor farther on the lad encountered tilda's father the unhappy king and delivered his message,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2876,7402-90848-0044,the joy of the monarch knew no bounds and bobo the one time simpleton became on the spot lord bobo of the sapphire hills marquis of the mountains of the moon prince of the valley of golden apples,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2877,7402-90848-0045,in a word the greatest nobleman in all fairyland,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2878,7402-90848-0046,all in splendid silks and soldiers in shining armor the delighted king rode off to claim his missing daughter from princess zenza so on they rode the harnesses jingling the bridle bells ringing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2879,7402-90848-0047,and the breastplates of the armed men shining in the sun after a week of almost constant progress for the king was so anxious to see his beloved daughter that he would hardly give the cavalcade time to rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2880,7402-90848-0048,on the steps of one of the cottages sat an old woman all alone and weeping with all her might what is the matter my good woman said the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2881,7402-90848-0049,evil days have fallen upon our unhappy kingdom three days ago a terrible dragon alighted in the gardens of the palace and sent word to princess zenza that if within three days she did not provide him with someone brave enough to go home with him and cook his meals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2882,7402-90848-0050,and keep his cavern tidy he would burn our fields with his fiery breath yet who i ask you would be housekeeper for a dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2883,7402-90848-0051,that we are mourning at two o'clock she is to be carried off by the dragon it is almost two now alas alas hardly were the words out of her mouth when the town bell struck twice solemnly and sadly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2884,7402-90848-0052,quick quick cried the king and bobo in the same breath let us hurry to the castle we may save her yet but they knew in their hearts that they were too late and that poor tilda had given herself to the dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2885,7402-90848-0053,and so it proved in spite of his mad dash bobo who had spurred on ahead arrived exactly half an hour late the monstrous dragon with tilda in his claws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2886,7402-90848-0054,things should be exactly as they were half an hour before he opened the cover of the ebony box something like a winged white flame escaped from it and flew hissing through the air to the sun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2887,7402-90848-0055,as for the sun itself turning round like a cartwheel and hissing like ten thousand rockets it rolled back along the sky to the east the hands of the clocks which marked half past two whirred back to two o'clock in a twinkling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2888,7402-90848-0056,and sure enough there was brave little tilda standing alone in a great field waiting for the dragon to come and take her away lumbering heavily along like a monstrous turtle and snorting blue smoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2889,7402-90848-0057,the dragon was advancing toward her bobo ran down into the field and stood beside tilda ready to defend her to the end the dragon came nearer and nearer suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2890,7402-90848-0058,angered by the sight of bobo and his drawn sword he roared angrily but continued to approach bobo struck at him with his sword the blade broke upon his steely scales the dragon roared again now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2891,7402-90848-0059,just as the dragon's mouth was its widest bobo who had been searching his pockets desperately hurled into it the lost temper there was a perfectly terrific bang as if a million balloons had blown up all at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2892,7402-90848-0060,for the dragon had blown up the lost temper had finished him only one fragment of him a tiny bit of a claw was ever found,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2895,8747-293952-0000,things went very smoothly at gore hall after durham had established lucy as its mistress during the absence of bernard the girl herself firmly believed that her cousin was dead and assumed deep mourning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2896,8747-293952-0001,and felt his loss deeply it was her outspoken affection that provoked a quarrel between her and julius and which led to the breaking of their engagement lucy had a high temper which had been kept in subjection during the life of sir simon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2900,8747-293952-0005,the fact that he suspected someone of passing himself off as bernard startled her and opened an abyss at her feet on leaving the office she judged it best to lower her crest for the moment and to wait patiently to see what would transpire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2956,8747-293952-0061,you take a high tone he said sneeringly but remember that if bernard is dead the money goes to charities so much the better you do not get it nor you either,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2958,8747-293952-0063,a great deal some day by blackmailing bernard said lucy indignantly julius picked up the ring and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket calmly we don't know that bernard is alive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2959,8747-293952-0064,but the fact of conniston leaving the army and from durham's attitude i shrewdly suspect he is and in hiding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2960,8747-293952-0065,and then it depends upon him whether he is hanged or prefers to live abroad on a portion of his money the lesser portion i know the price of your silence said lucy vehemently you will want the hall and a large income,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2961,8747-293952-0066,all i can get rejoined beryl quietly and you have refused to share my fortune with me yes i will have nothing to do with you and remember that if i catch you plotting i will tell mister durham,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2962,8747-293952-0067,you can tell him the whole of this conversation snarled beryl i am not afraid of durham if bernard is alive he'll have to pay up or be hanged he is innocent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2963,8747-293952-0068,julius shrugged his shoulders and walked to the door there he paused to utter a final insulting speech i don't know whether you intend to marry bernard or lord conniston he said but i wish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2964,8747-293952-0069,which ever it is joy of a spitfire and an honest woman said miss randolph wrathfully for the reference to conniston touched her nearly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2965,8747-293952-0070,but you go too fast you can't yet prove that bernard lives i go to do so sneered julius and bowed himself ironically out of the room leaving lucy furious both with him and with herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2966,8747-293952-0071,she was angry with herself because she felt that in speaking of conniston she had colored and as a matter of fact she greatly admired the young lord even though they had only met once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2967,8747-293952-0072,for conniston was one of those irresistible men who appeal to women lucy thought but it matters little what she thought all she knew was that her engagement to julius which had always weighed on her conscience was at an end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2968,8747-293952-0073,i am free now free she said stretching her hands oh what an escape i have had from that wicked man he has shown his hand too plainly i will put mister durham on his guard and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2969,8747-293952-0074,here she blushed and lord conniston julius walking towards the bower was also angry with himself as lucy thought he had shown his hand too clearly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2970,8747-293952-0075,it would have been better he considered to have held my tongue i should have done so had she not goaded me into speech she will tell durham and that interfering conniston and put them on their guard well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2971,8747-293952-0076,he laughed and looked at the small boy trotting beside him i am equal to both the boy was a handsome innocent looking little fellow rather undersized,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2972,8747-293952-0077,with his clear skin his fair hair and wide blue eyes he looked like the conventional picture of a cherub,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2973,8747-293952-0078,but his mind had not yet had time to work on his face and the mask of his childhood for he was only thirteen concealed his evil nature successfully in a few years when his passions worked their way through the mask his face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2974,8747-293952-0079,would be wrinkled and sinful his mind would have marked plainly its signet on the smooth surface but at present he looked charmingly innocent although he already knew much more about life than was good for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2975,8747-293952-0080,julius in order that the lad might make an impression on miss plantagenet had dressed him in a new suit and pleased with himself for much of the boy remained in this precocious criminal young jerry trotted along smiling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2976,8747-293952-0081,jerry said beryl looking down mind you are nice to the old lady jerry tossed his fair curls and looked roguish oh that's all right mister beryl all old ladies take to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2977,8747-293952-0082,they think i'm a kind of holy bill and i let them think so it pays jerry you are a young scamp of the worst the boy chuckled as though he had received a compliment i like doing things he explained frankly it's fun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2978,8747-293952-0083,if it hadn't been for victoria,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2979,8747-293952-0084,you know nothing about such things corrected the respectable mister beryl severely i know a jolly sight more than you think said the urchin under his breath and producing a cigarette julius took it from him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2980,8747-293952-0085,and dull said jerry putting his hands in his pockets lord what a bore stopping with her will be but i can nip over and see victoria when i like and keep an eye on lord conniston as i told you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2981,8747-293952-0086,i'm fly said master moon and began whistling julius looked at him with satisfaction he intended that the boy should remain in the neighborhood so as to keep watch on conniston,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2982,8747-293952-0087,on durham and on alice malleson for this last reason he was introducing him into the house if bernard were alive as julius began to suspect he would come to one of these three people and then jerry would at once become aware of the fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2983,8747-293952-0088,miss berengaria was as usual in the garden looking after the well being of some white chrysanthemums she raised her head when she saw her visitors and a look of annoyance crossed her face when she saw mister beryl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2984,8747-293952-0089,and but for the sake of alice she would have refused to let him enter the bower as it was and with great diplomacy so great that it deceived even the astute beryl she asked him to come into the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2985,8747-293952-0090,luckily alice was out of the way having gone to pay a visit but she was expected back momentarily and miss berengaria wished to get rid of julius before the girl returned she might be able to conceal her real feelings but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2986,8747-293952-0091,alice being so young and impulsive might show her dislike too plainly and put beryl on his guard who is this you have here asked miss plantagenet putting on her spectacles and surveying jerry with admiration what a pretty lad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2987,8747-293952-0092,he is a lad i wish you to help said beryl blandly last time we met miss plantagenet you mentioned that you wanted a page not exactly a page said the old dame rubbing her nose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2988,8747-293952-0093,a sure sign she was perplexed merely a boy to see after the fowls and to wait about the house when necessary i love fowls said jerry sweetly and looking as innocent as a babe and dogs and things like that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2989,8747-293952-0094,you seem a nice lad who is he mister beryl a poor boy who sold matches in london but i didn't always piped jerry shifting from one leg to the other in feigned embarrassment and playing his part perfectly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2990,8747-293952-0095,i lived with grandmother at cove castle that's lord conniston's place said miss berengaria more perplexed than ever what were you doing there i lived with grandmother my name is jerry moon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2991,8747-293952-0096,his lordship got me a situation at a tobacconist's said the child like moon and then he got me turned off why that is not like lord conniston,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2992,8747-293952-0097,it is not to lord conniston's credit but i must know the reason said the old dame sharply if you want me to take the lad into my service jerry in answer to a look of beryl's began to weep ostentatiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2993,8747-293952-0098,i saw his lordship dressed as a soldier he snuffled and i told mister beryl his lordship was so angry that he got me turned off saying i was ungrateful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2994,8747-293952-0099,you should always hold your tongue said miss berengaria angrily you had no right to tell what lord conniston wished kept secret it was only a freak on his part he left the army at my request,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2995,8747-293952-0100,at your request said julius looking at her directly forearmed as she was miss berengaria with the consciousness of bernard's secret flushed through her withered skin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2996,8747-293952-0101,but turned the conversation defiantly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2997,8747-293952-0102,yes sweet lady don't talk like that child call me ma'am,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2998,8747-293952-0103,mister beryl such a kind gentleman ma'am said you would help me i will so long as you are honest jerry thrust his tongue in his cheek but julius answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2999,8747-293952-0104,i can vouch for his honesty he said but he talks too much he must hold his tongue here said the old dame severely and shaking her trowel at the boy where are his clothes i have none but what's on cried jerry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3000,8747-293952-0105,the kind gentleman got them for me ma'am you are a better christian than i thought said miss berengaria looking at beryl well you can stay here boy go to the kitchen and tell the servants to give you something to eat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3001,8747-293952-0106,jerry grinned and ducked towards the door good bye jerry said beryl kindly don't forget me if i do may i be oh no kind lady i mean ma'am i won't swear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3002,8747-293952-0107,i never did having been to sunday school yes ma'am i'm going and jerry in answer to an imperative wave of his new mistress's hand disappeared miss berengaria turned to beryl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3003,8747-293952-0108,i must see that he doesn't swear or smoke or indulge in any of those wicked things i hope he will do your recommendation credit mister beryl i hope he will said julius and felt a strong inclination,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3004,8747-293952-0109,then he took his leave and the old lady watched him go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3005,6925-80680-0000,one hot night in hindustan a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice and they hoped they were going to sleep but they never did presently they became more broad awake than ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3006,6925-80680-0001,at the sound of a howl outside the palace listen to that tiger remarked the king tiger replied the queen how should there be a tiger inside the city it was only a jackal i tell you it was a tiger said the king and i tell you that you were dreaming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3007,6925-80680-0002,if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen i say it was a tiger cried the king don't contradict me nonsense snapped the queen it was a jackal and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at last very well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3008,6925-80680-0003,we'll call the guard and ask and if it was a jackal i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away and if it was a tiger then you shall go and i will marry a new wife as you like answered the queen there isn't any doubt which it was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3009,6925-80680-0004,so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them but whilst the dispute was going on the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3010,6925-80680-0005,mind you declare that the king is right it certainly was a jackal but if we say so the king will probably not keep his word about going away and we shall get into trouble so we had better take his side to this the other agreed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3011,6925-80680-0006,the king made no remark but sent for a palanquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her in spite of her tears she was forced to obey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3012,6925-80680-0007,and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3013,6925-80680-0008,and started home again now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back so she stayed quite still for a long time listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3014,6925-80680-0009,but heard none after a while she grew nervous for she was all alone and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3015,6925-80680-0010,but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions there was no sign of any human being then her spirit gave way and she began to cry it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3016,6925-80680-0011,where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbours as it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house but was awakened by the sound of weeping he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could and into the forest towards the place the sound came from,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3017,6925-80680-0012,and when she had told her story the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on and in the farm a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named ameer ali,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3018,6925-80680-0013,years passed without a sign from the king his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care though the queen still lived with the farmer and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong handsome and healthy youth out in the forest they seemed far from the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3019,6925-80680-0014,very few ever came near them and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living but she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait until,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3020,6925-80680-0015,at last when he was eighteen years of age they had not the heart to forbid him any longer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3021,6925-80680-0016,a big brass pot to hold water a few pieces of silver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3022,6925-80680-0017,many a weary mile he tramped day after day until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred and he stepped joyfully into it like one who goes to meet an old friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3023,6925-80680-0018,presently as he made his way through a thicket he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner so he fired a pellet at it from his galail but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter at the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3024,6925-80680-0019,and on reaching the spot he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3025,6925-80680-0020,the old woman's face brightened she showed him where to seek the water and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim she led the way without a word and he followed in a short while they came to a hut in the forest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3026,6925-80680-0021,and as they drew near it ameer ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on at the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut and much as he wished to see her again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3027,6925-80680-0022,ameer ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back and so with a heavy heart he made his salutation and bade the old woman farewell but when he had gone a little way she called after him if ever you are in trouble or danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3028,6925-80680-0023,come to where you now stand and cry fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me now and i will listen to you the prince thanked her and continued his journey but he thought little of the old woman's saying and much of the lovely damsel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3029,6925-80680-0024,shortly afterwards he arrived at a city and as he was now in great straits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3030,6925-80680-0025,the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3031,6925-80680-0026,and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous this was just what ameer ali wanted and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3032,6925-80680-0027,soon after this on a dark and stormy night when the river roared beneath the palace walls the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter but the servant falling on his knees in terror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3033,6925-80680-0028,begged that he might not be sent on such an errand particularly on a night so wild when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad indeed so frightened was he that the king who was very kind hearted bade another to go in his stead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3034,6925-80680-0029,but each one showed the same strange fear then ameer ali stepped forward this is my duty your majesty he said i will go the king nodded and off he went the night was as dark as pitch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3035,6925-80680-0030,but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water inch by inch and foot by foot he fought his way across now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy now narrowly escaping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3036,6925-80680-0031,being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream at length he emerged panting and dripping wet on the other side close by the bank stood a gallows and on the gallows hung the body of some evildoer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3037,6925-80680-0032,whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3038,6925-80680-0033,or of the roaring river as for ghosts and witches they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman what ails you he said now the woman was not really a woman at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3039,6925-80680-0034,but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth if ever a man strayed into witchland the ogresses used to eat him up and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3040,6925-80680-0035,in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue so when ameer ali questioned her she replied ah kind sir it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows help me to get him down and i will bless you for ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3041,6925-80680-0036,ameer ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3042,6925-80680-0037,and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back which she did very nimbly then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3043,6925-80680-0038,but ameer ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3044,6925-80680-0039,and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness ameer ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3045,6925-80680-0040,and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace when he had finished his story he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king who like everyone else was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3046,6925-80680-0041,ameer ali himself was astonished for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since the king was delighted at its beauty and having praised and rewarded ameer ali he gave the anklet to his daughter a proud and spoiled princess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3047,6925-80680-0042,now in the women's apartments in the palace there hung two cages in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling and these two birds could talk as well as human beings they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3048,6925-80680-0043,walking grandly about with her treasure tied round her ankle she heard the starling say to the parrot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3049,6925-80680-0044,that was the parrot's name how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel think snapped the parrot who was cross because they hadn't given him his bath that morning i think she looks like a washerwoman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3050,6925-80680-0045,why doesn't she wear two of them instead of going about with one leg adorned and the other empty when the princess heard this she burst into tears and sending for her father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3051,6925-80680-0046,or she would die of shame so the king sent for ameer ali,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3052,6925-80680-0047,or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment poor ameer ali was greatly troubled at the king's command but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans he left the palace at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3053,6925-80680-0048,and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels were to be got but though he sought night and day he never found one to compare with the anklet at last only a week remained and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the fairy of the forest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3054,6925-80680-0049,therefore away he went and after a day's travelling he reached the cottage in the forest and standing where he had stood when the old woman called to him he cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me help me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3055,6925-80680-0050,then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten what is the matter she asked in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3056,6925-80680-0051,then he told her his story and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart and then turning to him she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3057,6925-80680-0052,and hold it over the cauldron and every drop of blood that falls from it into the water will become a jewel next you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet and the one at my feet stands at my head and place the severed foot against the wound and it will heal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3058,6925-80680-0053,and i shall become quite well again as before at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3059,6925-80680-0054,at length she persuaded him to do her bidding he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off she lay as one lifeless but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3060,6925-80680-0055,and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems his heart took courage very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron and he quickly changed the wands placed the severed foot against the wound and immediately the two parts became one as before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3061,6925-80680-0056,then the maiden opened her eyes sprang to her feet and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut and would not come out or speak to him any more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3062,6925-80680-0057,but three rare and beautiful anklets and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts and the next day the vain princess put two anklets on each foot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3063,6925-80680-0058,and strutted up and down in them admiring herself in the mirrors that lined her room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3064,6925-80680-0059,and never recovered his temper until after lunch she's got all her beauty at one end of her now if she had a few of those fine gew gaws round her neck and wrists she would look better but now to my mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3065,6925-80680-0060,she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up poor princess she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3066,6925-80680-0061,and then she declared to her father that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die again the king sent for ameer ali and ordered him to get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month or be put to a cruel death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3067,6925-80680-0062,and again ameer ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3068,6925-80680-0063,once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3069,6925-80680-0064,and her head her words turned ameer ali pale with horror but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before and at last he consented to do as she bade him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3070,6925-80680-0065,from her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3071,6925-80680-0066,then the head and hands were joined on to the body and left neither sign nor scar full of gratitude ameer ali tried to speak to her but she ran into the house and would not come back and he was forced to leave her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3072,6925-80680-0067,when on the day appointed ameer ali produced a necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless than the last the king's astonishment knew no bounds and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3073,6925-80680-0068,the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3074,6925-80680-0069,how do you think our princess is looking now very fine no doubt grumbled the parrot but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only she ought to have a husband why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3075,6925-80680-0070,then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry ameer ali,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3076,6925-80680-0071,so the king sent for ameer ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honour of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne on hearing this speech,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3077,6925-80680-0072,ameer ali bowed low and answered that he had done and would do the king all the service that lay in his power save only this one thing the king who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man flew into a passion and the princess was more furious still,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3078,6925-80680-0073,ameer ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find and ordered to be kept there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3079,6925-80680-0074,so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighbouring countries proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and heir to the throne should present himself at the palace when the day came all the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men young and old,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3080,6925-80680-0075,who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone else to gain both the throne and the princess as soon as the king was seated he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3081,6925-80680-0076,well hasten then said the king i have no time to waste your majesty said the farmer has now lived and administered justice long in this city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3082,6925-80680-0077,whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3083,6925-80680-0078,no your majesty answered the farmer i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered to day to try and claim your daughter and kingdom every city has sent them and they wait hungry and eager but do not o king mistake or pretend again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3084,6925-80680-0079,to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger the king turned first red and then pale there is continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne where,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3085,6925-80680-0080,growing pale as he listened in prison replied the farmer if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals i will explain clear the court commanded the king and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3086,6925-80680-0081,then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up ameer ali and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside at the sight of her the king was filled with shame and self reproach and wished he could have lived his life over again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3087,6925-80680-0082,and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death my day is past said he and he gave up his crown to his son ameer ali who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3088,6925-80680-0083,there is only one person i will marry said he and this time the maiden did not run away but agreed to be his wife so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily as for the old woman whose pitcher ameer ali had broken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3089,6925-80680-0084,she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she gladly returned to fairyland the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife any more if he even looks as if he does not agree with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3090,6925-80680-0085,she smiles at him and says is it the tiger then or the jackal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3091,7517-100442-0000,at the bookstall i have often longed to be a grocer to be surrounded by so many interesting things sardines bottled raspberries,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3092,7517-100442-0001,biscuits with sugar on the top preserved ginger hams brawn under glass everything in fact that makes life worth living,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3093,7517-100442-0002,at one moment to walk up a ladder in search of nutmeg at the next to dive under a counter in pursuit of cinnamon to serve little girls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3094,7517-100442-0003,and lordly people like you and me with a pint of cherry gin is not this to follow the king of trades some day i shall open a grocer's shop and you will find me in my spare evenings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3095,7517-100442-0004,aproned behind the counter look out for the currants in the window as you come in i have an idea for something artistic in the way of patterns there but as you love me do not offer to buy any,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3096,7517-100442-0005,we grocers only put the currants out for show and so that we may run our fingers through them luxuriously when business is slack i have a good line in shortbreads madam if i can find the box,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3097,7517-100442-0006,but no currants this evening i beg you yes to be a grocer is to live well but after all it is not to see life a grocer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3098,7517-100442-0007,in as far as it is possible to a man who sells both scented soap and pilchards would become narrow we do not come into contact with the outside world much save through the medium of potted lobster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3099,7517-100442-0008,and to sell a man potted lobster is not to have our fingers on his pulse potted lobster does not define a man all customers are alike to the grocer provided their money is good,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3100,7517-100442-0009,i perceive now that i was over hasty in deciding to become a grocer that is rather for one's old age while one is young and interested in persons rather than in things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3101,7517-100442-0010,there is only one profession to follow the profession of bookstall clerk to be behind a bookstall is indeed to see life the fascination of it struck me suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3102,7517-100442-0011,last monday and wondered who bought the tie clips the answer came to me just as i got into my train ask the man behind the bookstall he would know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3103,7517-100442-0012,yes and he would know who bought all his papers and books and pamphlets and to know this is to know something about the people in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3104,7517-100442-0013,you cannot tell a man by the lobster he eats but you can tell something about him by the literature he reads for instance i once occupied a carriage on an eastern line,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3105,7517-100442-0014,with among others a middle aged woman as soon as we left liverpool street she produced a bag of shrimps grasped each individual in turn firmly by the head and tail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3106,7517-100442-0015,and ate him when she had finished she emptied the ends out of the window wiped her hands and settled down comfortably to her paper what paper you'll never guess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3108,7517-100442-0017,conceive the holy joy of the bookstall clerk as she and her bag of shrimps yes he could have told at once they were shrimps approached and asked for the morning post,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3109,7517-100442-0018,the day can never be dull to the bookstall clerk i imagine him assigning in his mind the right paper to each customer this man will ask for golfing wrong,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3110,7517-100442-0019,he wants cage birds that one over there wants the motor ah well the auto car that's near enough soon he would begin to know the different types he would learn to distinguish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3111,7517-100442-0020,between the patrons of the dancing times and of the vote the era and the athenaeum delightful surprises would overwhelm him at intervals as when,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3112,7517-100442-0021,a red letter day in all the great stations a gentleman in a check waistcoat makes the double purchase of homer's penny stories and the spectator on those occasions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3113,7517-100442-0022,and they would be very rare his faith in human nature would begin to ooze away until all at once he would tell himself excitedly that the man was obviously an escaped criminal in disguise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3114,7517-100442-0023,rather overdoing the part after which he would hand over the winning post and the animals friend to the pursuing detective in a sort of holy awe what a life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3115,7517-100442-0024,but he has other things than papers to sell he knows who buys those little sixpenny books of funny stories a problem which has often puzzled us others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3116,7517-100442-0025,he understands by now the type of man who wants to read up a few good jokes to tell them down at old robinson's where he is going for the week end our bookstall clerk doesn't wait to be asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3117,7517-100442-0026,as soon as this gentleman approaches he whips out the book dusts it and places it before the raconteur he recognizes also at a glance the sort of silly ass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3118,7517-100442-0027,who is always losing his indiarubber umbrella ring half way across the station he can see him and he hastens to get a new card out in readiness or we would let you have seven for sixpence sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3119,7517-100442-0028,and even when one of those subtler characters draws near about whom it is impossible to say immediately whether they require a fountain pen with case or the life and letters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3120,7517-100442-0029,of major general clement bulger c b even then the man behind the bookstall is not found wanting if he is wrong the first time he never fails to recover with his second bulger sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3121,7517-100442-0030,one of our greatest soldiers i thought of these things last monday and definitely renounced the idea of becoming a grocer and as i wandered round the bookstall thinking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3131,7517-100437-0005,my uncle benjamin i read it in the translation eager as i am to be lyrical about it i shall refrain i think that i am probably safer with tillier than with butler,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3132,7517-100437-0006,but i dare not risk it the thought of your scorn at my previous ignorance of the world famous tillier your amused contempt because i have only just succeeded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3133,7517-100437-0007,in borrowing the classic upon which you were brought up this is too much for me let us say no more about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3134,7517-100437-0008,who has not heard of claude tillier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3135,7517-100437-0009,who has not read it in french or as i did in american let us pass on to another book for i am going to speak of another discovery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3136,7517-100437-0010,of a book which should be a classic but is not of a book of which nobody has heard unless through me it was published some twelve years ago the last published book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3137,7517-100437-0011,of a well known writer when i tell you his name you will say oh yes i love his books and you will mention so and so and its equally famous sequel such and such,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3138,7517-100437-0012,but when i ask you if you have read my book you will profess surprise and say that you have never heard of it is it as good as so and so and such and such you will ask,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3139,7517-100437-0013,hardly believing that this could be possible much better i shall reply and there if these things were arranged properly would be another ten per cent in my pocket but believe me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3140,7517-100437-0014,i shall be quite content with your gratitude well the writer of my book is kenneth grahame you have heard of him good i thought so the books you have read,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3141,7517-100437-0015,are the golden age and dream days am i not right thank you but the book you have not read my book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3142,7517-100437-0016,the wind in the willows am i not right again ah i was afraid so the reason why i knew you had not read it is the reason why i call it my book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3143,7517-100437-0017,for the last ten or twelve years i have been recommending it usually i speak about it at my first meeting with a stranger it is my opening remark just as yours is something futile about the weather,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3144,7517-100437-0018,if i don't get it in at the beginning i squeeze it in at the end the stranger has got to have it some time should i ever find myself in the dock and one never knows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3145,7517-100437-0019,my answer to the question whether i had anything to say would be well my lord if i might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving mister justice darling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3146,7517-100437-0020,would probably pretend that he had read it but he wouldn't deceive me for one cannot recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3147,7517-100437-0021,whether it is well known or not it is the amazing truth that none of those hundreds had heard of the wind in the willows until i told them about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3148,7517-100437-0022,some of them had never heard of kenneth grahame well one did not have to meet them again and it takes all sorts to make a world but most of them were in your position,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3149,7517-100437-0023,great admirers of the author and his two earlier famous books but ignorant thereafter i had their promise before they left me and waited confidently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3150,7517-100437-0024,for their gratitude no doubt they also spread the good news in their turn and it is just possible that it reached you in this way but it was to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3151,7517-100437-0025,none the less that your thanks were due for instance you may have noticed a couple of casual references to it as if it were a classic known to all in a famous novel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3152,7517-100437-0026,published last year it was i who introduced that novelist to it six months before indeed i feel sometimes that it was i who wrote the wind in the willows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3153,7517-100437-0027,and recommended it to kenneth grahame but perhaps i am wrong here for i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance nor as i have already lamented am i financially interested in its sale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3154,7517-100437-0028,an explanation which suspicious strangers require from me sometimes i shall not describe the book for no description would help it but i shall just say this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3155,7517-100437-0029,that it is what i call a household book by a household book i mean a book which everybody in the household loves and quotes continually ever afterwards a book which is read aloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3156,7517-100437-0030,to every new guest and is regarded as the touchstone of his worth but it is a book which makes you feel that though everybody in the house loves it it is only you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3157,7517-100437-0031,who really appreciate it at its true value and that the others are scarcely worthy of it it is obvious you persuade yourself that the author was thinking of you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3158,7517-100437-0032,when he wrote it i hope this will please jones were his final words as he laid down his pen well of course you will order the book at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3159,7517-100437-0033,but i must give you one word of warning when you sit down to it don't be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgment on my taste,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3160,7517-100437-0034,still less on the genius of kenneth grahame you are merely sitting in judgment on yourself you may be worthy i do not know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3161,7517-100429-0000,the pond my friend aldenham's pond stands at a convenient distance from the house and is reached by a well drained gravel path so that in any weather one may walk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3162,7517-100429-0001,alone or in company dry shod to its brink and estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen in the night the ribald call it the hippopotamus pond tracing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3163,7517-100429-0002,a resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the zoo beneath the waters of which if you particularly desire to point the hippopotamus out to somebody he always lies hidden to the rest of us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3164,7517-100429-0003,it is known simply as the pond a designation which ignores the existence of several neighbouring ponds the gifts of nature and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3165,7517-100429-0004,for the pond is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious there are seven steps to the bottom of the pond and each step,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3166,7517-100429-0005,thus the steps help to make the pond a convenient rain gauge for obviously when only three steps are left uncovered as was the case last monday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3167,7517-100429-0006,when the pond began to fill to strangers this may seem surprising and it is only fair to tell them the great secret which is that much of the surrounding land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3168,7517-100429-0007,drains secretly into the pond too this seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3169,7517-100429-0008,for when your whole day's cricket has been spoilt it is perfectly absurd,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3170,7517-100429-0009,has done the damage the soul yearns for something more startling than that the record of the pond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3171,7517-100429-0010,soothes us where the record of the ordinary pedantic rain gauge would leave us infuriated it speaks much for my friend aldenham's breadth of view that he understood this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3172,7517-100429-0011,and planned the pond accordingly a most necessary thing in a country house is that there should be a recognized meeting place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3173,7517-100429-0012,where the people who have been writing a few letters after breakfast may when they have finished meet those who have no intention of writing any and arrange plans with them for the morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3174,7517-100429-0013,i am one of those who cannot write letters in another man's house and when my pipe is well alight i say to miss robinson or whoever it may be let's go and look at the pond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3175,7517-100429-0014,right oh she says willingly enough having spent the last quarter of an hour with the times financial supplement all of the paper that is left to the women in the first rush for the cricket news,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3176,7517-100429-0015,we wander down to the pond together and perhaps find brown and miss smith there a lot of rain in the night says brown it was only just over the third step after lunch yesterday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3177,7517-100429-0016,we have a little argument about it miss robinson being convinced that she stood on the second step after breakfast and miss smith repeating that it looks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3178,7517-100429-0017,by and by two or three others stroll up and we all make measurements together the general opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3179,7517-100429-0018,must be a record but anyhow it is fairly fine now and what about a little lawn tennis or golf or croquet or and so the arrangements for the morning are made,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3180,7517-100429-0019,and they can be made more readily out of doors for supposing it is fine the fresh air calls you to be doing something and the sight of the newly marked tennis lawn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3181,7517-100429-0020,fills you with thoughts of revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before but indoors it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast and once there with all the papers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3182,7517-100429-0021,to be disinclined to leave it till lunch time a man or woman as lazy as this must not be rushed say to such a one come and play and the invitation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3183,7517-100429-0022,will be declined say come and look at the pond and the worst sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise and once he is out he is out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3184,7517-100429-0023,all this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3185,7517-100429-0024,from morning till night how tired we get of being indoors on these days even with the best of books the pleasantest of companions the easiest of billiard tables,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3186,7517-100429-0025,yet if our hostess were to see us marching out with an umbrella how odd she would think us where are you off to she would ask and we could only answer lamely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3187,7517-100429-0026,er i was just going to er walk about a bit but now we tell her brightly i'm going to see the pond it must be nearly full won't you come too and with any luck she comes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3188,7517-100429-0027,to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond for there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3189,7517-100429-0028,what will happen then aldenham may know but we his guests do not some think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and the kitchen garden but for myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3190,7517-100429-0029,i believe that we are promised something much bigger than that a man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3191,7517-100429-0030,will help to celebrate it i have no doubt with an open air play tank drama or what not at any rate we have every hope that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3192,7517-100429-0031,so that we may watch it fill again i must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond but all the same,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3193,7517-100429-0032,have fallen in the last three weeks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3194,2092-145706-0000,kletke there was once upon a time a man and woman who had three fine looking sons but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves let alone their children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3195,2092-145706-0001,of her and their father the three set forth on their travels the youngest of the three brothers whose name was ferko was a beautiful youth with a splendid figure blue eyes fair hair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3196,2092-145706-0002,and a complexion like milk and roses his two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3197,2092-145706-0003,for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking ferko fell fast asleep but the other two remained awake and the eldest said to the second brother what do you say to doing our brother ferko some harm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3198,2092-145706-0004,he is so beautiful that everyone takes a fancy to him which is more than they do to us if we could only get him out of the way we might succeed better i quite agree with you answered the second brother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3199,2092-145706-0005,and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread and then to refuse to give him a bit of ours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs his eldest brother was delighted with this proposal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3200,2092-145706-0006,and the two wicked wretches seized ferko's loaf and ate it all up while the poor boy was still asleep when he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread but his brothers cried out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3201,2092-145706-0007,you ate your loaf in your sleep you glutton and you may starve as long as you like but you won't get a scrap of ours ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep but he said nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3202,2092-145706-0008,and fasted all that day and the next night but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3203,2092-145706-0009,and break one of your legs then we will give you a bit of our bread at these words poor ferko wept more bitterly than before and bore the torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3204,2092-145706-0010,then he could stand it no longer and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out and his left leg to be broken when this was done he stretched out his hand eagerly for the piece of bread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3205,2092-145706-0011,but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them for a second bit but the more ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3206,2092-145706-0012,the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day but when night came his endurance gave way and he let his right eye be put out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3207,2092-145706-0013,and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread after his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3208,2092-145706-0014,poor ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly but no one heard him or came to his help night came on and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3209,2092-145706-0015,and could only crawl along the ground not knowing in the least where he was going but when the sun was once more high in the heavens ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3210,2092-145706-0016,and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs he climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3211,2092-145706-0017,is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighbourhood i should just think there was replied the other many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3212,2092-145706-0018,there is a lake down there below us and anyone who bathes in it though he were at death's door becomes sound and well on the spot and those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3213,2092-145706-0019,become as sharp sighted as the eagle even if they have been blind from their youth well answered the first raven my eyes are in no want of this healing bath for heaven be praised,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3214,2092-145706-0020,they are as good as ever they were but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago so let us fly at once to the lake that i may be restored to health and strength again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3215,2092-145706-0021,and so they flew away their words rejoiced ferko's heart and he waited impatiently till evening should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3216,2092-145706-0022,at last it began to grow dusk and the sun sank behind the mountains gradually it became cooler on the hill and the grass grew wet with dew then ferko buried his face in the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3217,2092-145706-0023,till his eyes were damp with dewdrops and in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life before the moon was shining brightly and lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3218,2092-145706-0024,then ferko crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water no sooner had he done so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3219,2092-145706-0025,he had not gone far before he met a wolf who was limping disconsolately along on three legs and who on perceiving ferko began to howl dismally my good friend said the youth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3220,2092-145706-0026,be of good cheer for i can soon heal your leg and with these words he poured some of the precious water over the wolf's paw and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3221,2092-145706-0027,the grateful creature thanked his benefactor warmly and promised ferko to do him a good turn if he should ever need it ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3222,2092-145706-0028,here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws for its front paws had both been broken in a trap ferko felt so sorry for the little beast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3223,2092-145706-0029,that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner and washed its small paws with the healing water in a moment the mouse was sound and whole and after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3224,2092-145706-0030,ferko again proceeded on his journey but he hadn't gone far before a queen bee flew against him trailing one wing behind her which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3225,2092-145706-0031,ferko was no less willing to help her than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing on the spot the queen bee was cured and turning to ferko she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3226,2092-145706-0032,i am most grateful for your kindness and shall reward you some day and with these words she flew away humming gaily then ferko wandered on for many a long day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3227,2092-145706-0033,and at length reached a strange kingdom here he thought to himself he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country for he had heard that the king's daughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3228,2092-145706-0034,they had managed to obtain places in the king's service and when they recognised ferko with his eyes and legs sound and well they were frightened to death for they feared he would tell the king of their conduct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3229,2092-145706-0035,for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before his brothers noticed this and envy and jealousy were added to their fear so much so that they determined once more to destroy him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3230,2092-145706-0036,they went to the king and told him that ferko was a wicked magician who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the princess then the king had ferko brought before him and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3231,2092-145706-0037,you are accused of being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter and i condemn you to death but if you can fulfil three tasks which i shall set you to do your life shall be spared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3232,2092-145706-0038,on condition you leave the country but if you cannot perform what i demand you shall be hung on the nearest tree and turning to the two wicked brothers he said suggest something for him to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3233,2092-145706-0039,no matter how difficult he must succeed in it or die they did not think long but replied let him build your majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this and if he fails in the attempt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3234,2092-145706-0040,let him be hung the king was pleased with this proposal and commanded ferko to set to work on the following day the two brothers were delighted for they thought they had now got rid of ferko for ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3235,2092-145706-0041,as he was wandering disconsolately about the meadows round the palace wondering how he could escape being put to death a little bee flew past and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3236,2092-145706-0042,what is troubling you my kind benefactor can i be of any help to you i am the bee whose wing you healed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3237,2092-145706-0043,a palace shall be built unlike any that king has dwelt in before just stay here till i come again and tell you that it is finished having said this she flew merrily away and ferko,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3238,2092-145706-0044,be of good cheer and lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls and humming gaily she flew away again ferko went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3239,2092-145706-0045,the whole court went out to see the wonder and their astonishment was great at the sight which met their eyes a splendid palace reared itself on the hill just outside the walls of the city made of the most exquisite flowers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3240,2092-145706-0046,with sunflowers for knockers and all round hyacinths and other sweet smelling flowers bloomed in masses so that the air was perfumed far and near and enchanted all who were present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3241,2092-145706-0047,this splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen bee who had summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her the king's amazement knew no bounds and the princess's eyes beamed with delight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3242,2092-145706-0048,on the delighted ferko but the two brothers had grown quite green with envy and only declared the more that ferko was nothing but a wicked magician,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3243,2092-145706-0049,the king although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his commands had been carried out was very vexed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3244,2092-145706-0050,and turning to the two brothers he said he has certainly accomplished the first task with the aid no doubt of his diabolical magic but what shall we give him to do now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3245,2092-145706-0051,let us make it as difficult as possible and if he fails he shall die then the eldest brother replied the corn has all been cut but it has not yet been put into barns,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3246,2092-145706-0052,let the knave collect all the grain in the kingdom into one big heap before to morrow night and if as much as a stalk of corn is left let him be put to death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3247,2092-145706-0053,the princess grew white with terror when she heard these words but ferko felt much more cheerful than he had done the first time and wandered out into the meadows again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3248,2092-145706-0054,but he could think of no way of escape the sun sank to rest and night came on when a little mouse started out of the grass at ferko's feet and said to him i'm delighted to see you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3249,2092-145706-0055,my kind benefactor but why are you looking so sad can i be of any help to you and thus repay your great kindness to me then ferko recognised the mouse whose front paws he had healed and replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3250,2092-145706-0056,before to morrow night all the grain in the kingdom has to be gathered into one big heap and if as much as a stalk of corn is wanting i must pay for it with my life is that all answered the mouse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3251,2092-145706-0057,that needn't distress you much just trust in me and before the sun sets again you shall hear that your task is done and with these words the little creature scampered away into the fields,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3252,2092-145706-0058,ferko who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning the day passed slowly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3253,2092-145706-0059,and the whole court went out to see the wonder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3254,2092-145706-0060,for in a heap higher than the king's palace lay all the grain of the country and not a single stalk of corn had been left behind in any of the fields and how had all this been done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3255,2092-145706-0061,the little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the land to its help and together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom the king could not hide his amazement but at the same time his wrath increased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3256,2092-145706-0062,and he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers who kept on repeating,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3257,2092-145706-0063,than a wicked magician only the beautiful princess rejoiced over ferko's success and looked on him with friendly glances which the youth returned the more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3258,2092-145706-0064,the more angry he became for he could not in the face of his promise put the stranger to death he turned once more to the two brothers and said his diabolical magic has helped him again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3259,2092-145706-0065,but now what third task shall we set him to do no matter how impossible it is he must do it or die the eldest answered quickly let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom on to this hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3260,2092-145706-0066,before to morrow night if he does this he may go free if not he shall be hung as you have said at these words the princess burst into tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3261,2092-145706-0067,and when the king saw this he ordered her to be shut up in a high tower and carefully guarded till the dangerous magician should either have left the kingdom or been hung on the nearest tree ferko wandered out into the fields again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3262,2092-145706-0068,and sat down on the stump of a tree wondering what he should do next suddenly a big wolf ran up to him and standing still said i'm very glad to see you again my kind benefactor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3263,2092-145706-0069,what are you thinking about all alone by yourself if i can help you in any way only say the word for i would like to give you a proof of my gratitude ferko at once recognised the wolf,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3264,2092-145706-0070,whose broken leg he had healed and told him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his life but how in the world he added am i to collect all the wolves of the kingdom on to that hill over there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3265,2092-145706-0071,if that's all you want done answered the wolf you needn't worry yourself i'll undertake the task and you'll hear from me again before sunset to morrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3266,2092-145706-0072,and with these words he trotted quickly away then the youth rejoiced greatly for now he felt that his life was safe but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3267,2092-145706-0073,and that he would never see her again if he left the country he lay down once more on the grass and soon fell fast asleep all the next day he spent wandering about the fields,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3268,2092-145706-0074,then return at once to me and get on my back and i will help you to drive all the wolves together then ferko went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3269,2092-145706-0075,ferko himself returned to the fields and mounting on the wolf's back he rode to the wood close by quick as lightning the wolf flew round the wood and in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3270,2092-145706-0076,increasing in number every moment till they could be counted by thousands he drove them all before him on to the hill where the king and his whole court and ferko's two brothers were standing only the lovely princess was not present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3271,2092-145706-0077,for she was shut up in her tower weeping bitterly the wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs but the king was overcome by a sudden terror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3272,2092-145706-0078,when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer and calling out to ferko he said enough enough we don't want any more but the wolf on whose back ferko sat said to its rider,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3273,2092-145706-0079,go on go on and at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill howling horribly and showing their white teeth the king in his terror called out stop a moment i will give you half my kingdom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3274,2092-145706-0080,if you will drive all the wolves away but ferko pretended not to hear and drove some more thousands before him so that everyone quaked with horror and fear then the king raised his voice again and called out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3275,2092-145706-0081,stop you shall have my whole kingdom if you will only drive these wolves back to the places they came from but the wolf kept on encouraging ferko and said go on go on so he led the wolves on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3276,2092-145706-0082,till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked brothers and ate them and the whole court up in a moment then ferko went straight to the palace and set the princess free and on the same day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3277,2092-145706-0083,he married her and was crowned king of the country and the wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes and ferko and his bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3278,2092-145709-0000,kletke once upon a time there were three princesses who were all three young and beautiful but the youngest although she was not fairer than the other two was the most loveable of them all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3279,2092-145709-0001,about half a mile from the palace in which they lived there stood a castle which was uninhabited and almost a ruin but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3280,2092-145709-0002,and in this garden the youngest princess used often to walk one day when she was pacing to and fro under the lime trees a black crow hopped out of a rose bush in front of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3281,2092-145709-0003,the poor beast was all torn and bleeding and the kind little princess was quite unhappy about it when the crow saw this it turned to her and said i am not really a black crow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3282,2092-145709-0004,but an enchanted prince who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery if you only liked princess you could save me but you would have to say good bye to all your own people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3283,2092-145709-0005,and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle there is one habitable room in it in which there is a golden bed there you will have to live all by yourself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3284,2092-145709-0006,and don't forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night you must not scream out for if you give as much as a single cry my sufferings will be doubled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3285,2092-145709-0007,the good natured princess at once left her home and her family and hurried to the ruined castle and took possession of the room with the golden bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3286,2092-145709-0008,when night approached she lay down but though she shut her eyes tight sleep would not come at midnight she heard to her great horror some one coming along the passage and in a minute,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3287,2092-145709-0009,her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room they at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3288,2092-145709-0010,when they had done this they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay and screaming and yelling all the time they dragged her towards the cauldron she nearly died with fright,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3289,2092-145709-0011,but she never uttered a sound then of a sudden the cock crew and all the evil spirits vanished at the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all round the room with joy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3290,2092-145709-0012,it thanked the princess most heartily for her goodness and said that its sufferings had already been greatly lessened now one of the princess's elder sisters who was very inquisitive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3291,2092-145709-0013,that at last the good natured little princess consented but at midnight when the odd folk appeared the elder sister screamed with terror and from this time on the youngest princess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3292,2092-145709-0014,insisted always on keeping watch alone so she lived in solitude all the daytime and at night she would have been frightened had she not been so brave but every day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3293,2092-145709-0015,the crow came and thanked her for her endurance and assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been and so two years passed away when one day the crow came to the princess and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3294,2092-145709-0016,in another year i shall be freed from the spell i am under at present because then the seven years will be over but before i can resume my natural form,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3295,2092-145709-0017,and take possession of the belongings of my forefathers you must go out into the world and take service as a maidservant the young princess consented at once and for a whole year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3296,2092-145709-0018,and had worked her little white hands weary she heard a rustling beside her and a cry of joy then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her who knelt down at her feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3297,2092-145709-0019,and kissed the little weary white hands i am the prince he said who you in your goodness when i was wandering about in the shape of a black crow freed from the most awful torments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3298,2092-145709-0020,come now to my castle with me and let us live there happily together so they went to the castle where they had both endured so much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3299,2092-145709-0021,it was difficult to believe that it was the same for it had all been rebuilt and done up again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3300,6437-66173-0000,chapter ten i fight conway there was one person however who cherished a strong suspicion that the centipedes had had a hand in the business and that person was conway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3301,6437-66173-0001,his red hair seemed to change to a livelier red and his sallow cheeks to a deeper sallow as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our slates the next day in school he knew we were watching him and made sundry mouths,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3302,6437-66173-0002,and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his own that of throwing his thumbs out of joint at will sometimes while absorbed in study or on becoming nervous at recitation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3303,6437-66173-0003,he performed the feat unconsciously throughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a chronic state of dislocation indicating great mental agitation on the part of the owner we fully expected an outbreak from him at recess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3304,6437-66173-0004,but the intermission passed off tranquilly somewhat to our disappointment at the close of the afternoon session it happened that binny wallace and myself having got swamped in our latin exercise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3305,6437-66173-0005,were detained in school for the purpose of refreshing our memories with a page of mister andrews's perplexing irregular verbs binny wallace finishing his task first was dismissed i followed shortly after,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3306,6437-66173-0006,and on stepping into the playground saw my little friend plastered as it were up against the fence and conway standing in front of him ready to deliver a blow on the upturned unprotected face whose gentleness would have stayed any arm but a coward's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3307,6437-66173-0007,but on seeing me sweep across the yard whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling he called out lustily lay low conway here's young bailey conway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended for his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3308,6437-66173-0008,he reached forward one of his long arms he had arms like a windmill that boy and grasping me by the hair tore out quite a respectable handful the tears flew to my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3309,6437-66173-0009,but they were not the tears of defeat they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature paid to the departed tresses in a second my little jacket lay on the ground and i stood on guard resting lightly on my right leg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3310,6437-66173-0010,and keeping my eye fixed steadily on conway's in all of which i was faithfully following the instructions of phil adams whose father subscribed to a sporting journal conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3311,6437-66173-0011,and there we were glaring at each other motionless neither of us disposed to risk an attack but both on the alert to resist one there is no telling how long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been interrupted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3312,6437-66173-0012,it was a custom with the larger pupils to return to the playground after school and play baseball until sundown the town authorities had prohibited ball playing on the square and there being no other available place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3313,6437-66173-0013,the boys fell back perforce on the school yard just at this crisis a dozen or so of the templars entered the gate and seeing at a glance the belligerent status of conway and myself dropped bat and ball and rushed to the spot where we stood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3314,6437-66173-0014,is it a fight asked phil adams who saw by our freshness that we had not yet got to work yes it's a fight i answered unless conway will ask wallace's pardon promise never to hector me in future,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3315,6437-66173-0015,and put back my hair this last condition was rather a staggerer i sha'n't do nothing of the sort said conway sulkily then the thing must go on said adams with dignity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3316,6437-66173-0016,rodgers as i understand it is your second conway bailey come here what's the row about he was thrashing binny wallace no i wasn't interrupted conway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3317,6437-66173-0017,but i was going to because he knows who put meeks's mortar over our door and i know well enough who did it it was that sneaking little mulatter pointing at me o by george i cried reddening at the insult,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3318,6437-66173-0018,cool is the word said adams as he bound a handkerchief round my head and carefully tucked away the long straggling locks that offered a tempting advantage to the enemy who ever heard of a fellow with such a head of hair going into action,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3319,6437-66173-0019,muttered phil twitching the handkerchief to ascertain if it were securely tied he then loosened my gallowses braces and buckled them tightly above my hips now then bantam never say die,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3320,6437-66173-0020,conway regarded these business like preparations with evident misgiving for he called rodgers to his side and had himself arrayed in a similar manner though his hair was cropped so close that you couldn't have taken hold of it with a pair of tweezers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3321,6437-66173-0021,is your man ready asked phil adams addressing rodgers ready keep your back to the gate tom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3322,6437-66173-0022,and you'll have the sun in his eyes behold us once more face to face like david and the philistine look at us as long as you may for this is all you shall see of the combat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3323,6437-66173-0023,according to my thinking the hospital teaches a better lesson than the battle field i will tell you about my black eye and my swollen lip if you will but not a word of the fight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3324,6437-66173-0024,you'll get no description of it from me simply because i think it would prove very poor reading and not because i consider my revolt against conway's tyranny unjustifiable i had borne conway's persecutions for many months with lamb like patience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3325,6437-66173-0025,i might have shielded myself by appealing to mister grimshaw but no boy in the temple grammar school could do that without losing caste whether this was just or not doesn't matter a pin since it was so a traditionary law of the place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3326,6437-66173-0026,the personal inconvenience i suffered from my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted on me indirectly by his persistent cruelty to little binny wallace i should have lacked the spirit of a hen if i had not resented it finally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3327,6437-66173-0027,i am glad that i faced conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever i am glad that phil adams taught me to box and i say to all youngsters learn to box to ride to pull an oar and to swim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3328,6437-66173-0028,the occasion may come round when a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments will be of service to you in one of the best books,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3329,6437-66173-0029,ever written for boys are these words learn to box then as you learn to play cricket and football not one of you will be the worse but very much the better for learning to box well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3330,6437-66173-0030,that you have to say yes or no to a challenge to fight say no if you can only take care you make it plain to yourself why you say no it's a proof of the highest courage if done from true christian motives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3331,6437-66173-0031,it's quite right and justifiable if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger but don't say no because you fear a licking and say or think it's because you fear god for that's neither christian nor honest and if you do fight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3332,6437-66173-0032,fight it out and don't give in while you can stand and see and don't give in when you can't see for i could stand very little and see not at all having pommelled the school pump for the last twenty seconds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3333,6437-66173-0033,when conway retired from the field as phil adams stepped up to shake hands with me he received a telling blow in the stomach for all the fight was not out of me yet and i mistook him for a new adversary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3334,6437-66173-0034,convinced of my error i accepted his congratulations with those of the other boys blandly and blindly i remember that binny wallace wanted to give me his silver pencil case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3335,6437-66173-0035,the gentle soul had stood throughout the contest with his face turned to the fence suffering untold agony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3336,6437-66173-0036,escorted by two or three of the schoolfellows i walked home through the pleasant autumn twilight battered but triumphant as i went along my cap cocked on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3337,6437-66173-0037,i felt that i was not only following my nose but following it so closely that i was in some danger of treading on it i seemed to have nose enough for the whole party my left cheek also was puffed out like a dumpling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3338,6437-66173-0038,i couldn't help saying to myself if this is victory how about that other fellow tom said harry blake hesitating well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3339,6437-66173-0039,did you see mister grimshaw looking out of the recitation room window just as we left the yard no was he though i am sure of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3340,6437-66173-0040,shouldn't wonder no he didn't broke in adams or he would have stopped it short metre,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3341,6437-66173-0041,well it can't be helped now i reflected as the monkey said when he fell out of the cocoanut tree added charley marden trying to make me laugh it was early candle light when we reached the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3342,6437-66173-0042,miss abigail opening the front door started back at my hilarious appearance i tried to smile upon her sweetly but the smile rippling over my swollen cheek and dying away like a spent wave on my nose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3343,6437-66173-0043,produced an expression of which miss abigail declared she had never seen the like excepting on the face of a chinese idol she hustled me unceremoniously into the presence of my grandfather in the sitting room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3344,6437-66173-0044,captain nutter as the recognized professional warrior of our family could not consistently take me to task for fighting conway nor was he disposed to do so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3345,6437-66173-0045,for the captain was well aware of the long continued provocation i had endured ah you rascal cried the old gentleman after hearing my story just like me when i was young always in one kind of trouble or another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3346,6437-66173-0046,i believe it runs in the family i think said miss abigail without the faintest expression on her countenance that a table spoonful of hot dro the captain interrupted miss abigail peremptorily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3347,6437-66173-0047,directing her to make a shade out of cardboard and black silk to tie over my eye miss abigail must have been possessed with the idea that i had taken up pugilism as a profession for she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3348,6437-66173-0048,they'll be handy to have in the house says miss abigail grimly of course so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by mister grimshaw,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3349,6437-66173-0049,he had as we suspected witnessed the closing scene of the fight from the school room window and the next morning after prayers i was not wholly unprepared when master conway and myself were called up to the desk for examination,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3350,6437-66173-0050,as the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of bailey versus conway i shall not report the trial further than to say that adams marden and several other pupils testified to the fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3351,6437-66173-0051,that conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the temple school their evidence also went to show that conway was a quarrelsome character generally bad for conway seth rodgers on the part of his friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3352,6437-66173-0052,proved that i had struck the first blow that was bad for me if you please sir said binny wallace holding up his hand for permission to speak bailey didn't fight on his own account he fought on my account and if you please sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3353,6437-66173-0053,i am the boy to be blamed for i was the cause of the trouble this drew out the story of conway's harsh treatment of the smaller boys as binny related the wrongs of his playfellows saying very little of his own grievances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3354,6437-66173-0054,i noticed that mister grimshaw's hand unknown to himself perhaps rested lightly from time to time on wallace's sunny hair the examination finished mister grimshaw leaned on the desk thoughtfully for a moment and then said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3355,6437-66173-0055,every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to fight if one boy maltreats another within school bounds or within school hours that is a matter for me to settle the case should be laid before me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3356,6437-66173-0056,i disapprove of tale bearing i never encourage it in the slightest degree but when one pupil systematically persecutes a schoolmate it is the duty of some head boy to inform me no pupil has a right to take the law into his own hands,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3357,6437-66173-0057,if there is any fighting to be done i am the person to be consulted i disapprove of boys fighting it is unnecessary and unchristian in the present instance i consider every large boy in this school at fault,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3358,6437-66173-0058,but as the offence is one of omission rather than commission my punishment must rest only on the two boys convicted of misdemeanor conway loses his recess for a month and bailey has a page added to his latin lessons for the next four recitations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3359,6437-66173-0059,i now request bailey and conway to shake hands in the presence of the school and acknowledge their regret at what has occurred conway and i approached each other slowly and cautiously as if we were bent upon another hostile collision,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3360,6437-66173-0060,we clasped hands in the tamest manner imaginable and conway mumbled i'm sorry i fought with you i think you are i replied drily and i'm sorry i had to thrash you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3361,6437-66173-0061,you can go to your seats said mister grimshaw turning his face aside to hide a smile i am sure my apology was a very good one i never had any more trouble with conway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3362,6437-66173-0062,he and his shadow seth rodgers gave me a wide berth for many months nor was binny wallace subjected to further molestation miss abigail's sanitary stores including a bottle of opodeldoc were never called into requisition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3363,6437-66172-0000,in the course of ten days i recovered sufficiently from my injuries to attend school where for a little while i was looked upon as a hero on account of having been blown up what don't we make a hero of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3364,6437-66172-0001,the distraction which prevailed in the classes the week preceding the fourth had subsided and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities excepting a noticeable want of eyebrows on the part of pepper whitcomb and myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3365,6437-66172-0002,in august we had two weeks vacation it was about this time that i became a member of the rivermouth centipedes a secret society composed of twelve of the temple grammar school boys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3366,6437-66172-0003,this was an honor to which i had long aspired but being a new boy i was not admitted to the fraternity until my character had fully developed itself it was a very select society the object of which i never fathomed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3367,6437-66172-0004,though i was an active member of the body during the remainder of my residence at rivermouth and at one time held the onerous position of f c first centipede each of the elect wore a copper cent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3368,6437-66172-0005,some occult association being established between a cent apiece and a centipedes suspended by a string round his neck the medals were worn next the skin and it was while bathing one day at grave point with jack harris and fred langdon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3369,6437-66172-0006,that i had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch by a sight of these singular emblems as soon as i ascertained the existence of a boys club of course i was ready to die to join it and eventually i was allowed to join,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3370,6437-66172-0007,the initiation ceremony took place in fred langdon's barn where i was submitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a timorous boy before being led to the grotto of enchantment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3371,6437-66172-0008,such was the modest title given to the loft over my friend's wood house my hands were securely pinioned and my eyes covered with a thick silk handkerchief at the head of the stairs i was told in an unrecognizable husky voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3372,6437-66172-0009,if i felt myself physically too weak to undergo the necessary tortures i replied that i was not too weak in a tone which i intended to be resolute but which in spite of me seemed to come from the pit of my stomach it is well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3373,6437-66172-0010,a prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination and i was wondering what would come next,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3374,6437-66172-0011,the unknown voice then directed me to take ten steps forward and stop at the word halt i took ten steps and halted stricken mortal said a second husky voice more husky if possible than the first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3375,6437-66172-0012,if you had advanced another inch you would have disappeared down an abyss three thousand feet deep i naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information a prick from some two pronged instrument evidently a pitchfork,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3376,6437-66172-0013,gently checked my retreat i was then conducted to the brink of several other precipices and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms where the result would have been instant death if i had committed the least mistake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3377,6437-66172-0014,i have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by dismal groans from different parts of the grotto finally i was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an incalculable height,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3378,6437-66172-0015,a second pistol shot was heard the something i stood on sunk with a crash beneath my feet and i fell two miles as nearly as i could compute it at the same instant the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes and i found myself standing in an empty hogshead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3379,6437-66172-0016,surrounded by twelve masked figures fantastically dressed one of the conspirators was really appalling with a tin sauce pan on his head and a tiger skin sleigh robe thrown over his shoulders i scarcely need say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3380,6437-66172-0017,that there were no vestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which i had passed so cautiously my ascent had been to the top of the hogshead and my descent to the bottom thereof holding one another by the hand and chanting a low dirge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3381,6437-66172-0018,the mystic twelve revolved about me this concluded the ceremony with a merry shout the boys threw off their masks and i was declared a regularly installed member of the r m c,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3382,6437-66172-0019,i afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club for these initiations as you may imagine were sometimes very comical spectacles especially when the aspirant for centipedal honors happened to be of a timid disposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3383,6437-66172-0020,if he showed the slightest terror he was certain to be tricked unmercifully one of our subsequent devices a humble invention of my own was to request the blindfolded candidate to put out his tongue whereupon the first centipede would say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3384,6437-66172-0021,in a low tone as if not intended for the ear of the victim diabolus fetch me the red hot iron the expedition with which that tongue would disappear was simply ridiculous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3385,6437-66172-0022,our meetings were held in various barns at no stated periods but as circumstances suggested any member had a right to call a meeting each boy who failed to report himself was fined one cent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3386,6437-66172-0023,whenever a member had reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend he called a meeting for instance immediately on learning the death of harry blake's great grandfather i issued a call,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3387,6437-66172-0024,by these simple and ingenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition sometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter i have said that the society had no special object it is true there was a tacit understanding among us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3388,6437-66172-0025,that the centipedes were to stand by one another on all occasions though i don't remember that they did but further than this we had no purpose unless it was to accomplish as a body the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as individuals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3389,6437-66172-0026,to mystify the staid and slow going rivermouthians was our frequent pleasure several of our pranks won us such a reputation among the townsfolk that we were credited with having a large finger in whatever went amiss in the place one morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3390,6437-66172-0027,about a week after my admission into the secret order the quiet citizens awoke to find that the signboards of all the principal streets had changed places during the night people who went trustfully to sleep in currant square opened their eyes in honeysuckle terrace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3391,6437-66172-0028,jones's avenue at the north end had suddenly become walnut street and peanut street was nowhere to be found confusion reigned the town authorities took the matter in hand without delay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3392,6437-66172-0029,and six of the temple grammar school boys were summoned to appear before justice clapbam having tearfully disclaimed to my grandfather all knowledge of the transaction i disappeared from the family circle and was not apprehended until late in the afternoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3393,6437-66172-0030,when the captain dragged me ignominiously from the haymow and conducted me more dead than alive to the office of justice clapham here i encountered five other pallid culprits who had been fished out of divers coal bins garrets and chicken coops,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3394,6437-66172-0031,to answer the demands of the outraged laws charley marden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his father's house and looked like a recently exhumed mummy there was not the least evidence against us and indeed we were wholly innocent of the offence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3395,6437-66172-0032,the trick as was afterwards proved had been played by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor we were indebted for our arrest to master conway who had slyly dropped a hint within the hearing of selectman mudge to the effect that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3396,6437-66172-0033,young bailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs when he was called upon to make good his assertion he was considerably more terrified than the centipedes though they were ready to sink into their shoes at our next meeting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3397,6437-66172-0034,it was unanimously resolved that conway's animosity should not be quietly submitted to he had sought to inform against us in the stagecoach business he had volunteered to carry pettingil's little bill for twenty four icecreams to charley marden's father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3398,6437-66172-0035,and now he had caused us to be arraigned before justice clapham on a charge equally groundless and painful after much noisy discussion a plan of retaliation was agreed upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3399,6437-66172-0036,there was a certain slim mild apothecary in the town by the name of meeks it was generally given out that mister meeks had a vague desire to get married but being a shy and timorous youth lacked the moral courage to do so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3400,6437-66172-0037,it was also well known that the widow conway had not buried her heart with the late lamented as to her shyness that was not so clear indeed her attentions to mister meeks whose mother she might have been,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3401,6437-66172-0038,were of a nature not to be misunderstood and were not misunderstood by anyone but mister meeks himself the widow carried on a dress making establishment at her residence on the corner opposite meeks's drug store,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3402,6437-66172-0039,casting destructive glances across the street the artificial roses in her cap and her whole languishing manner saying as plainly as a label on a prescription to be taken immediately but mister meeks didn't take,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3403,6437-66172-0040,the lady's fondness and the gentleman's blindness were topics ably handled at every sewing circle in the town it was through these two luckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3404,6437-66172-0041,to kill less than three birds with one stone did not suit our sanguinary purpose we disliked the widow not so much for her sentimentality as for being the mother of bill conway we disliked mister meeks not because he was insipid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3405,6437-66172-0042,like his own syrups but because the widow loved him bill conway we hated for himself late one dark saturday night in september we carried our plan into effect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3406,6437-66172-0043,on the following morning as the orderly citizens wended their way to church past the widow's abode their sober faces relaxed at beholding over her front door the well known gilt mortar and pestle which usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3407,6437-66172-0044,was recognized at once it spread like wildfire over the town and though the mortar and the placard were speedily removed our triumph was complete the whole community was on the broad grin and our participation in the affair seemingly unsuspected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3408,7190-90543-0000,however obscure a mystery may be there is always some point or circumstance which if rightly interpreted will lead to its solution even in those crimes which have never been elucidated this point exists only it has never been duly appreciated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3409,7190-90543-0001,for which the detective first looks and since few crimes if any are committed without some definite reason it is most frequently found in the motive his almost superhuman power of recognizing this key clew was the foundation of christopher quarles's success,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3410,7190-90543-0002,and his solution of the mysterious burglaries which caused such speculation for a time was not the least of his achievements sir joseph maynard the eminent physician of harley street had given a small dinner party one evening the guests left early,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3411,7190-90543-0003,and soon after midnight the household had retired neither sir joseph nor lady maynard nor any of the servants were disturbed during the night but next morning it was found that burglars had entered they had got in by a passage window at the back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3412,7190-90543-0004,not a very difficult matter and had evidently gone to the dining room and helped themselves to spirits from a tantalus which was on the sideboard three glasses with a little of the liquor left in them were on the table and near them were some biscuit crumbs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3413,7190-90543-0005,there were several silver articles on the sideboard but these had not been touched the burglars appeared to have given all their attention to sir joseph's room which was in a state of confusion two cupboards and every drawer had been turned out and the contents thrown about in all directions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3414,7190-90543-0006,but of an old fashioned type presenting little difficulty to experts in it besides papers and about seventy pounds in gold in a canvas bag,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3415,7190-90543-0007,presentations which had been made to him and some unique specimens of the queen anne period all this silver was upon the floor also the bag of money intact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3416,7190-90543-0008,it looked as if the box had been knocked down and trodden on by mistake for the counters were in a little heap close to the broken fragments it appeared that the burglars must have been disturbed and had made off without securing their booty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3417,7190-90543-0009,this was the obvious explanation but it did not satisfy me i questioned sir joseph about his papers had he any document which for private or public reasons someone might be anxious to obtain he said he had not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3418,7190-90543-0010,was inclined to laugh at my question and proceeded to inform me that he had no family skeleton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3419,7190-90543-0011,had never been in touch with any mysterious society,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3420,7190-90543-0012,but there were certain points against this idea no one had moved about the house during the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3421,7190-90543-0013,the silver on the floor was scattered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3422,7190-90543-0014,and it looked as if it had been thrown aside carelessly as though it were not what the thieves were in search of and surely had they left in a hurry the bag of money would have been taken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3423,7190-90543-0015,moreover the cigarette ends and the dirty glasses suggested a certain leisurely method of going to work and men of this kind would not be easily frightened the cigarette ends puzzled me they were of a cheap american brand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3424,7190-90543-0016,had not been taken from sir joseph's box which contained only turkish ones and although they had apparently been thrown down carelessly there was no ash upon the carpet nor anywhere else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3425,7190-90543-0017,if my idea were correct it would mean that they had been put there on purpose to mislead i examined the three glasses on the dining room table there was the stain of lips at the rim of one but not of the other two only one had been drunk out of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3426,7190-90543-0018,and probably a little of the liquid had been emptied out of this into the other two on inquiry one of the servants told me that only a very little of the spirit had been taken she also said there was only one biscuit left in the box last night and it was there now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3427,7190-90543-0019,by doing so i certainly saved one valuable life possibly more than one that he was interested was shown by our adjournment to the empty room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3428,7190-90543-0020,he said i think there was only one burglar but for some reason he thought it important that it should be believed there were more a very important point and a reasonable conclusion i fancy said quarles if you are right it narrows the sphere of inquiry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3429,7190-90543-0021,narrows it very much taken with the other facts of the case exactly i answered there is a suggestion to my mind of amateurishness in the affair i grant the safe was not a difficult one to break open but it had not been done in a very expert manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3430,7190-90543-0022,the cigarette ends the dirty glasses and the biscuit crumbs seem to me rather gratuitous deceptions and wait said quarles you assume a little too much they would have deceived nine men out of ten you happen to be the tenth man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3431,7190-90543-0023,amateur or not we have to deal with a very smart man so don't underestimate the enemy wigan assuming this to be the work of an amateur to what definite point does it lead you to this question i replied did sir joseph maynard burgle his own house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3432,7190-90543-0024,why should you think so his manner was curious then there is only his own statement that nothing has been taken but supposing he wished to get rid of papers or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3433,7190-90543-0025,would he not have robbed himself of something to make the affair more plausible said quarles the amateur constantly overlooks the obvious i answered the professor shook his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3434,7190-90543-0026,i think that would entirely depend on the man's temperament professor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3435,7190-90543-0027,sir joseph's standing is very high sudden temptation or necessity may subvert the highest character i answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3436,7190-90543-0028,when i questioned sir joseph about his papers his manner seemed curious as i have said he at once declared that he had no part in any government secret or mysterious society gratuitous information you understand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3437,7190-90543-0029,not in answer to any direct question of mine showing that the ideas were in his mind why the explanation would be simple if he were the burglar of his own papers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3438,7190-90543-0030,i admit the argument is sound wigan but it does not creep into my brain with any compelling influence there is a link missing in the chain somewhere and he looked at zena his often repeated statement that she helped him by her questions had never impressed me very greatly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3439,7190-90543-0031,when a mystery was cleared up it was easy to say that zena had put him on the right road and i considered it a whim of his more than anything else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3440,7190-90543-0032,it was so now you do not seem interested in the broken box of counters she said turning toward her grandfather i wonder wigan is that the clew quarles said quickly it creeps into my brain the counters were in a heap i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3441,7190-90543-0033,asked quarles no that would have scattered them more they were round and might have fallen over after having been put one upon another as one gathers coppers together when counting a number of them sir joseph picked them up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3442,7190-90543-0034,did that strike you as significant asked quarles i cannot say it did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3443,7190-90543-0035,they are significant wigan but i cannot see yet in which direction they lead us we must wait for the moment there is nothing to be done i had become so accustomed to quarles jumping to some sudden conclusion that i was disappointed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3444,7190-90543-0036,naturally i was not idle during the next few days but at the end of them i had learnt nothing then the unexpected happened on consecutive nights two doctors houses were burgled the first was in kensington,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3445,7190-90543-0037,rather than intended robbery nothing had been stolen but everything in his room was in disorder and a small and unique inlaid cabinet with a secret spring lock had been smashed to pieces several cigarette ends were on the floor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3446,7190-90543-0038,he had several cabinets in his room containing specimens and everything had been turned on to the floor and damaged more or less in fact although nothing had been taken the damage was considerable on the night of the burglary doctor wood was away from home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3447,7190-90543-0039,only servants being in the house the cook suffering from faceache had been restless all night but had heard nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3448,7190-90543-0040,for a revolver loaded in every chamber was found on one of the cabinets apparently having put it ready for use he had forgotten to take it away the doctor was furious at the wanton destruction of his specimens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3449,7190-90543-0041,the unexpected has happened i said no no the expected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3450,7190-90543-0042,i've read every report but tell me yourself every detail i did so the same brand of cigarettes he asked no but all cheap american ones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3451,7190-90543-0043,you still think that nothing has happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3452,7190-90543-0044,no i hold to the one man theory and you are right he snapped i admit i might not have got upon the right track had you not made that discovery it was clever wigan it did not seem to help you to a theory i answered true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3453,7190-90543-0045,much depended upon the answer if he had,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3454,7190-90543-0046,if the thief had not found what he wanted he would continue his search i argued for some reason he connected sir joseph maynard with the object of his search,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3455,7190-90542-0000,the identity of the final victim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3456,7190-90542-0001,as an excuse i talked over cases with him but he seldom volunteered an opinion often was obviously uninterested truth to tell i was not there for his opinion but to see his granddaughter a detective in love sounds something like an absurdity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3457,7190-90542-0002,but such was my case and since zena's manner did not suggest that she was particularly interested in me my love affair seemed rather a hopeless one my association with christopher quarles has however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3458,7190-90542-0003,led to the solution of some strange mysteries and since my own achievements are sufficiently well known i may confine myself to those cases which single handed i should have failed to solve i know that in many of them i was credited with having unraveled the mystery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3459,7190-90542-0004,but this was only because professor quarles persisted in remaining in the background if i did the spade work the deductions were his they were all cases with peculiar features in them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3460,7190-90542-0005,he was often as astonished at my acumen in following a clew as i was at his marvelous theories,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3461,7190-90542-0006,perhaps his curious power was never more noticeable than in the case of the withan murder a farmer returning from medworth the neighboring market town one night in january,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3462,7190-90542-0007,by evening the clouds had gone the moon sailed in a clear sky and looking round to find the cause of his horse's unusual behavior the farmer saw a man lying on a heap of snow under the opposite hedge he was dead more he was headless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3463,7190-90542-0008,it was not until some days later that the case came into my hands and in the interval the local authorities had not been idle it was noted that the man was poorly dressed that his hands proved he was used to manual labor but there was no mark either on his body or on his clothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3464,7190-90542-0009,nor any papers in his pockets to lead to his identification so far as could be ascertained,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3465,7190-90542-0010,and apparently no struggle had taken place footprints nearly obliterated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3466,7190-90542-0011,soon after the storm began and that snow had hidden the murderer's tracks from the wood that snow had drifted on to the dead body seemed to establish this theory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3467,7190-90542-0012,and would be found buried in the wood it was not found however and the countryside was in a state bordering on panic for a few days the withan murder seemed unique in atrocities and then came a communication from the french police,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3468,7190-90542-0013,some two years ago an almost identical murder had been committed outside a village in normandy in this case also the head was missing and nothing had been found upon the body to identify the victim he was well dressed and a man who would be likely to carry papers with him but nothing was found,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3469,7190-90542-0014,and the murder had remained a mystery these were the points known and conjectured when the case came into my hands and my investigations added little to them one point however impressed me i felt convinced that the man's clothes which were shown to me had not been made in england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3470,7190-90542-0015,they were poor worn almost threadbare but they had once been fairly good and the cut was not english that it was french i could not possibly affirm but it might be and so i fashioned a fragile link with the normandy crime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3471,7190-90542-0016,on this occasion i went to quarles with the object of interesting him in the withan case and he forestalled me by beginning to talk about it the moment i entered the room here i may mention a fact which i had not discovered at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3472,7190-90542-0017,whenever he was interested in a case i was always taken into his empty room at other times we were in the dining room or the drawing room it was the empty room on this occasion and zena remained with us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3473,7190-90542-0018,the foreign cut of the clothes may be of importance he said i am not sure is this wood you mention of any great extent no it runs beside the road for two or three hundred yards toward withan no it was near the withan end of it that the dead man was found,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3474,7190-90542-0019,any traces that the head was carried to the wood the local authorities say yes and not a trace afterward the ground in the wood was searched at the time and i have been over it carefully since through one part of the wood there runs a ditch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3475,7190-90542-0020,which is continued as a division between two fields which form part of the farm land behind the wood by walking along this the murderer might have left the wood without leaving tracks behind him a good point wigan and where would that ditch lead him eventually to the high road,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3476,7190-90542-0021,which runs almost at right angles to the withan road much water in the ditch asked quarles half a foot when i went there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3477,7190-90542-0022,there was a moon that night wasn't there full or near it i returned and how soon was the alarm raised along the countryside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3478,7190-90542-0023,and after going to the village the farmer returned to medworth for the police,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3479,7190-90542-0024,said zena and if he were met on the road carrying a bag he would arrest attention why carrying a bag asked quarles with the head in it she answered that's another good point wigan chuckled quarles of course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3480,7190-90542-0025,the head may be buried in the wood said zena quarles looked at me inquiringly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3481,7190-90542-0026,one or two doubtful places i had dug up i think the murderer must have taken the head with him to bury somewhere else asked quarles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3482,7190-90542-0027,a mad doctor bent on brain experiments is that your theory wigan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3483,7190-90542-0028,january the seventeenth nearly the same date as the english one said zena two years intervening i returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3484,7190-90542-0029,at that date said quarles you have a theory professor an outlandish one which would make you laugh no no i do not like being laughed at i never mention my theories until i have some facts to support them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3485,7190-90542-0030,i took the trouble to make inquiry whether any similar crime had happened in england in the january of the preceding year and had the same inquiry made in france there was no record of any murder bearing the slightest resemblance to the withan tragedy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3486,7190-90542-0031,a few days later quarles telegraphed me to meet him at kings cross and we traveled north together wait he said when i began to question him i am not sure yet my theory seems absurd we are going to find out if it is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3487,7190-90542-0032,we took rooms at a hotel in medworth quarles explaining that our investigations might take some days next morning instead of going to withan as i had expected he took me to the police court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3488,7190-90542-0033,the next afternoon he arranged a drive i thought we were going to withan but we turned away from the village and presently quarles stopped the carriage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3489,7190-90542-0034,five or six miles the road winds a lot it's a deal nearer as the crow flies you need not wait for us driver my friend and i are going to walk back the coachman pocketed his money and drove away couldn't keep him waiting all night as we may have to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3490,7190-90542-0035,said quarles mind you wigan i'm very doubtful about my theory at least i am not certain that i shall find the facts i want a few hours will settle it one way or the other after walking along the road for about a mile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3491,7190-90542-0036,quarles scrambled through a hedge into a wood by the roadside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3492,7190-90542-0037,should we meet anyone blame me say i am a doddering old fool who would walk under the trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3493,7190-90542-0038,do you go armed always i answered i do sometimes he said tapping his pocket we might come up against danger if my theory is correct if i tell you to shoot shoot and quickly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3494,7190-90542-0039,your life is likely to depend upon it and keep your ears open to make sure no one is following us he had become keen like a dog on the trail and old as he was seemed incapable of fatigue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3495,7190-90542-0040,whether he had studied the topography of the neighborhood i cannot say but he did not hesitate in his direction until he reached a high knoll which was clear of the wood and commanded a considerable view we were trespassers in a private park,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3496,7190-90542-0041,to our right was a large house only partially seen through its screen of trees but it was evidently mellow with age to our left toward what was evidently the extremity of the park was hilly ground which had been allowed to run wild,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3497,7190-90542-0042,to this quarles pointed that is our way he said we'll use what cover we can we plunged into the wood again and were soon in the wilderness forcing our way sometimes with considerable difficulty through the undergrowth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3498,7190-90542-0043,once or twice the professor gave me a warning gesture but he did not speak he had evidently some definite goal and i was conscious of excitement as i followed him for an hour or more he turned this way and that exploring every little ravine he could discover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3499,7190-90542-0044,grunting his disappointment each time he failed to find what he was looking for i said i wasn't certain he whispered when our path had led us into a damp hollow which looked as if it had not been visited by man for centuries my theory seems,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3500,7190-90542-0045,and yet this is such a likely place there must be a way he was going forward again the hollow was surrounded by perpendicular walls of sand and chalk it was a pit in fact which nature had filled with vegetation the way we had come seemed the only way into it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3501,7190-90542-0046,ah this looks promising quarles said suddenly in a corner of the wall or to be more precise filling up a rent in it was a shed roughly built but with a door secured by a very business like lock i think the shed is climbable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3502,7190-90542-0047,said quarles let's get on the roof i am not so young as i was so help me up it was not much help he wanted in a few moments we were on the roof as i thought he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3503,7190-90542-0048,we'll go carefully said quarles there may be worse than poachers traps here without help from me he dropped from the roof and i followed him the natural passage was winding and about fifty yards long and opened into another pit of some size,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3504,7190-90542-0049,a pit i call it but it was as much a cave as a pit part of it running deeply into the earth and only about a third of it being open to the sky the cave part had a rough sandy floor and here was a long shed of peculiar construction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3505,7190-90542-0050,the back part being closed in the roof was thatched with bark and dried bracken and against one end of the veranda was a notched tree trunk serving as a ladder as i expected said quarles with some excitement we must get onto the veranda for a moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3506,7190-90542-0051,i think we are alone here but keep your ears open the shed was evidently used sometimes there was a stone slab which had served as a fireplace and from a beam above hung a short chain on which a pot could easily be fixed we'll get away quickly said quarles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3507,7190-90542-0052,when in about thirty hours time the professor's sense of direction was marvelous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3508,7190-90542-0053,i daresay one would be allowed to see over the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3509,7190-90542-0054,he was always as secret as the grave until he had proved his theory and then he seemed anxious to forget the whole affair and shrank from publicity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3510,7190-90542-0055,we go there again this evening he said after lunch next day so a restful afternoon will suit us it was getting dark when we set out and again quarles's unerring sense of locality astonished me he led the way without hesitation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3511,7190-90542-0056,i think we are first but great care is necessary he whispered we crept forward and concealed ourselves among the scrub vegetation which grew in that part of the pit which was open to the sky it was dark the long shed barely discernible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3512,7190-90542-0057,but the professor was particular about our position we may have to creep a little nearer presently he whispered from here we can do so silence wigan and don't be astonished at anything the waiting seemed long moonlight was presently above us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3513,7190-90542-0058,throwing the cave part of the pit into greater shadow than ever i cannot attempt to say how long we had waited in utter silence when quarles touched my arm someone was coming and with no particular stealth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3514,7190-90542-0059,i heard footsteps on the raised floor of the shed a man's step and only one man's i heard him moving about for some time i think he came down the ladder once and went up again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3515,7190-90542-0060,then there was a light and sudden tiny flames in the dark he had evidently got fuel and had started a fire on the stone slab as the flames brightened i watched his restless figure he was not a young man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3516,7190-90542-0061,he was short thick set and quick in his movements,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3517,7190-90542-0062,when he got down again i saw that a bundle was suspended over the fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3518,7190-90542-0063,only the smoke curled about it then the man moved the wooden block to the side of the fire and sat down facing us the flickering flames throwing a red glow over him wigan do you see whispered quarles not clearly we'll go nearer carefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3519,7190-90542-0064,from our new point of view i looked again the man's face was familiar but just then i could not remember who he was it was the bundle hanging over the fire which fascinated me tied together and secured in a network of string,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3520,7190-90542-0065,were five or six human heads blackened shriveled faces which seemed to grin horribly as they swung deeply from side to side lit up by the flicker of the flames do you see wigan quarles asked again yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3521,7190-90542-0066,and the man who is he on the bench yesterday sir henry buckingham,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3522,7190-90542-0067,for an hour two three i don't know how long that horrible bundle swung over the fire and the man sat on his block of wood staring straight before him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3523,7190-90542-0068,and i waited expecting some further revelation listening for other footsteps none came the fire flickered lower and went out the moon had set and the cold of the early morning got into my bones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3524,7190-90542-0069,in the darkness before the dawn the man moved about the shed again and presently i heard him go patience whispered quarles as i started up to go after him he will not run away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3525,7190-90542-0070,my dear wigan he said when at last he condescended to talk it was zena who first set me on the right road when she remarked that a man who had walked in a ditch carrying a bag would arrest attention two points were suggested first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3526,7190-90542-0071,that the man might not have far to go to reach a place of safety secondly that he had come prepared to take a head away with him a mere speculation you may say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3527,7190-90542-0072,why should a head be required what kind of man would be likely to want a head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3528,7190-90542-0073,i sought for some peculiarity in his manner and found none yet his history coincided with my theory you know nothing about him i suppose nothing rather an interesting career but with an hereditary taint in it quarles went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3529,7190-90542-0074,his mother was eccentric her husband was rich enough to have her looked after at home had she been a poorer person she would have died in a madhouse religious mania hers was and her son has inherited it in a curious fashion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3530,7190-90542-0075,how have you learnt all this he is important enough to have some of his doings chronicled and he wrote some interesting articles for a country gentlemen's newspaper about his normandy tour nature studies and such like another point both these murders happened at the time of the full moon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3531,7190-90542-0076,i am not absolutely sure but i think you will find that for the last half dozen years sir henry has not been in england in january you think i think there would have been other heads missing if he had been quarles answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3532,7190-90542-0077,he was sane enough to be somewhere where he was not known when this time of the year came round at the full moon he is always queer witness last night but he is only dangerous in january dangerous i mean without provocation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3533,7190-90542-0078,to preserve his secret i have little doubt he would go to any length that is why i warned you to be ready to shoot when we went upon our journey of discovery now this year he was in england illness had kept him to his house yonder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3534,7190-90542-0079,and the insane desire proved irresistible he was cunning too he must know everybody in the neighborhood yet the man he killed was unknown we shall find presently i have no doubt that the victim was some wanderer returning unexpectedly to friends in withan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3535,7190-90542-0080,sir henry waiting in the wood perhaps for hours may have allowed others to pass before this man came he realized that he was a stranger and attacked him but the head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3537,7190-90542-0082,the horrible custom proved too much for his diseased brain and fascinated him you see how my theory grew then i looked for the actual proof which we found last night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3538,7190-90542-0083,the arrest of sir henry buckingham caused an enormous sensation he was subsequently put into a lunatic asylum where he died not many months afterward fortunately he had no children to run the risk of madness in their turn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3592,2911-7601-0013,and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew back but no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3595,2911-7601-0016,for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listening just as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3596,2911-7601-0017,presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of grief oh no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3597,2911-7601-0018,when overcharged with awe i knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world slept,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3598,2911-7601-0019,deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3599,2911-7601-0020,when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could not he had been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the chimney,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3601,2911-7601-0022,in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3602,2911-7601-0023,when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down i resolved to open a little a very very little crevice in the lantern so i opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3604,2911-7601-0025,and fell full upon the vulture eye it was open wide wide open and i grew furious as i gazed upon it i saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3605,2911-7601-0026,with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but i could see nothing else of the old man's face or person for i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3607,2911-7601-0028,such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old man's heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3608,2911-7601-0029,but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3609,2911-7601-0030,meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old man's terror must have been extreme it grew louder i say louder every moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3611,2911-7601-0032,yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must burst and now a new anxiety seized me the sound would be heard by a neighbour the old man's hour had come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3612,2911-7601-0033,with a loud yell i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room he shrieked once once only in an instant i dragged him to the floor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3613,2911-7601-0034,to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3682,3486-166446-0021,an ecstasy of tenderness a flame of unearthly rapture trembled over the woman's wondrous face hungrily defiantly she pressed the girl to her the stars in the lucid heavens of her eyes were soft and gentle and caressing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3683,3486-166446-0022,ruth cried drake and sprang toward them she paid no heed and even as he leaped he was caught whirled back against us wait said ventnor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3684,3486-166446-0023,there was a curious understanding in his voice a curious sympathy too in the patient untroubled gaze that dwelt upon his sister and this weirdly exquisite woman who held her wait exclaimed drake wait hell the damned witch is stealing her away from us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3685,3486-166446-0024,again he threw himself forward recoiled as though swept back by an invisible arm fell against us and was clasped and held by ventnor and as he struggled the thing we rode halted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3686,3486-166446-0025,like metal waves back into it rushed the enigmatic billows that had washed over the fragments of the city we were lifted between us and the woman and girl a cleft appeared it widened into a rift,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3687,3486-166446-0026,it was as though norhala had decreed it as a symbol of this her second victory or had set it between us as a barrier wider grew the rift,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3688,3486-166446-0027,save for the bridge of our voices it separated us from ruth as though she stood upon another world higher we rose the three of us now upon the flat top of a tower upon whose counterpart fifty feet away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3689,3486-166446-0028,quietly it glided to the chasm it had blasted in the cliff wall the shadow of those walls fell upon us as one we looked back as one we searched out the patch of blue with the black blot at its breast we found it then the precipices hid it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3690,3486-166446-0029,silently we streamed through the chasm through the canyon and the tunnel speaking no word drake's eyes fixed with bitter hatred upon norhala ventnor brooding upon her always with that enigmatic sympathy we passed between the walls of the further cleft,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3691,3486-166446-0030,stood for an instant at the brink of the green forest there came to us as though from immeasurable distances a faint sustained thrumming like the beating of countless muffled drums the thing that carried us trembled the sound died away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3692,3486-166446-0031,the thing quieted it began its steady effortless striding through the crowding trees but now with none of that speed with which it had come spurred forward by norhala's awakened hate ventnor stirred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3693,3486-166446-0032,purged not only by suffering but by it came to me some strange knowledge no use drake he said dreamily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3694,3486-166446-0033,but this i do know only one way or another can the balance fall and if it be one way then you and we shall have ruth back and if it falls the other way then there will be little need for us to care for man will be done martin what do you mean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3695,3486-166446-0034,it is the crisis he answered we can do nothing goodwin nothing whatever is to be steps forth now from the womb of destiny again there came that distant rolling louder now again the thing trembled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3696,3486-166446-0035,is it taps for them the drumming died as i listened fearfully about us was only the swishing the sighing of the falling trees beneath the tread of the thing motionless stood norhala,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3697,3486-166446-0036,and as motionless ruth martin i cried once more a dreadful doubt upon me martin what do you mean whence did they come his voice was clear and calm the eyes beneath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3698,3486-166446-0037,these creatures that when many still are one that when one still are many whence did they come what are they he looked down upon the cubes that held us their hosts of tiny eyes shone up at him enigmatically,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3699,3486-166446-0038,as though they heard and understood i do not forget he said at least not all do i forget of what i saw during that time when i seemed an atom outside space,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3700,3486-166446-0039,as i told you or think i told you speaking with unthinkable effort through lips that seemed eternities away from me the atom who strove to open them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3701,3486-166446-0040,revelations i know not what to call them and though each seemed equally real of two of them only one i think can be true and of the third that may some time be true but surely is not yet through the air came a louder drum roll,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3702,3486-166446-0041,in it something ominous something sinister it swelled to a crescendo abruptly ceased and now i saw norhala raise her head listen i saw a world a vast world goodwin marching stately through space,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3703,3486-166446-0042,it was no globe it was a world of many facets of smooth and polished planes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3704,3486-166446-0043,a geometric thought of the great cause of god if you will made material it was airless waterless sunless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3705,3486-166424-0000,as i gazed upon them i wondered to what secret place within their brooding immensities the little metal mysteries had fled and to what myriads it might be of their kind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3706,3486-166424-0001,of what powers small like these or or quick on the screen of my mind flashed two pictures side by side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3707,3486-166424-0002,the little four rayed print in the great dust of the crumbling ruin and its colossal twin on the breast of the poppied valley i turned aside crept through the shattered portal and looked over the haunted hollow unbelieving i rubbed my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3708,3486-166424-0003,then leaped to the very brim of the bowl a lark had risen from the roof of one of the shattered heaps and had flown caroling up into the shadowy sky a flock of the little willow warblers flung themselves across the valley scolding and gossiping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3709,3486-166424-0004,a hare sat upright in the middle of the ancient roadway the valley itself lay serenely under the ambering light smiling peaceful emptied of horror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3710,3486-166424-0005,i dropped over the side walked cautiously down the road up which but an hour or so before we had struggled so desperately paced farther and farther with an increasing confidence and a growing wonder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3711,3486-166424-0006,gone was that soul of loneliness vanished the whirlpool of despair that had striven to drag us down to death the bowl was nothing but a quiet smiling lovely little hollow in the hills i looked back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3712,3486-166424-0007,even the ruins had lost their sinister shape were time worn crumbling piles nothing more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3713,3486-166424-0008,a rifle shot rang out above us another and another from the portal scampered chiu ming his robe tucked up about his knees they come he gasped they come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3714,3486-166424-0009,down it was pouring an avalanche of men i caught the glint of helmets and corselets those in the van were mounted galloping two abreast upon sure footed mountain ponies their short swords lifted high flickered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3715,3486-166424-0010,after the horsemen swarmed foot soldiers a forest of shining points and dully gleaming pikes above them clearly to us came their battlecries again ventnor's rifle cracked one of the foremost riders went down another stumbled over him fell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3716,3486-166424-0011,the rush was checked for an instant milling upon the road dick i cried rush ruth over to the tunnel mouth we'll follow we can hold them there i'll get martin chiu ming after the pony quick i pushed the two over the rim of the hollow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3717,3486-166424-0012,quick mart i shouted up the shattered stairway we can get through the hollow ruth and drake are on their way to the break we came through hurry all right just a minute he called i heard him empty his magazine with almost machine gun quickness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3718,3486-166424-0013,all my ammunition is on him chiu ming's taking care of that i gasped we darted out of the gateway a good five hundred yards away were ruth and drake running straight to the green tunnel's mouth between them and us was chiu ming urging on the pony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3719,3486-166424-0014,as we sped after him i looked back the horsemen had recovered were now a scant half mile from where the road swept past the fortress i saw that with their swords the horsemen bore great bows a little cloud of arrows sparkled from them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3720,3486-166424-0015,fell far short don't look back grunted ventnor stretch yourself walter there's a surprise coming hope to god i judged the time right we turned off the ruined way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3721,3486-166424-0016,he reached out touched me you're right walter he grinned it does seem like carrying coals to newcastle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3722,3486-166424-0017,scattered prone among these were men and horses others staggered screaming on the farther side of this stony dike our pursuers were held like rushing waters behind a sudden fallen tree timed to a second cried ventnor hold em for a while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3723,3486-166424-0018,and holding ruth by the hand race back toward us even as he turned the vine screened entrance through which we had come through which we had thought lay safety streamed other armored men we were outflanked to the fissure shouted ventnor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3724,3486-166424-0019,drake heard for he changed his course to the crevice at whose mouth ruth had said the little things had lain after him streaked chiu ming urging on the pony shouting out of the tunnel down over the lip of the bowl leaped the soldiers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3725,3486-166424-0020,we dropped upon our knees sent shot after shot into them they fell back hesitated we sprang up sped on all too short was the check but once more we held them and again now ruth and dick were a scant fifty yards from the crevice i saw him stop,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3726,3486-166424-0021,push her from him toward it she shook her head now chiu ming was with them ruth sprang to the pony lifted from its back a rifle then into the mass of their pursuers drake and she poured a fusillade they huddled wavered broke for cover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3727,3486-166424-0022,a chance gasped ventnor behind us was a wolflike yelping the first pack had re formed had crossed the barricade the dynamite had made was rushing upon us i ran as i had never known i could,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3728,3486-166424-0023,over us whined the bullets from the covering guns close were we now to the mouth of the fissure if we could but reach it close close were our pursuers too the arrows closer no use said ventnor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3729,3486-166424-0024,nature's summoning of every reserve to meet that peril my eyes took them in with photographic nicety the linked mail lacquered blue and scarlet of the horsemen brown padded armor of the footmen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3730,3486-166424-0025,their bows and javelins and short bronze swords their pikes and shields and under their round helmets their cruel bearded faces white as our own where the black beards did not cover them their fierce and mocking eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3731,3486-166424-0026,in this world of ours twenty centuries beyond their time swiftly accurately even as i scanned them we had been drilling into them they advanced deliberately heedless of their fallen their arrows had ceased to fly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3732,3486-166424-0027,i wondered why for now we were well within their range,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3733,3486-166424-0028,we've saved ruth anyway he said drake ought to be able to hold that hole in the wall he's got lots of ammunition on the pony but they've got us another wild shouting down swept the pack,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3734,3486-166424-0029,we leaped to our feet sent our last bullets into them stood ready rifles clubbed to meet the rush i heard ruth scream what was the matter with the armored men why had they halted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3735,3486-166424-0030,what was it at which they were glaring over our heads and why had the rifle fire of ruth and drake ceased so abruptly simultaneously we turned within the black background of the fissure stood a shape an apparition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3736,3486-166424-0031,a woman beautiful awesome incredible she was tall standing there swathed from chin to feet in clinging veils of pale amber she seemed taller even than tall drake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3737,3486-166424-0032,yet it was not her height that sent through me the thrill of awe of half incredulous terror which relaxing my grip let my smoking rifle drop to earth nor was it that about her proud head a cloud of shining tresses swirled and pennoned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3738,3486-166424-0033,like a misty banner of woven copper flames no nor that through her veils her body gleamed faint radiance it was her eyes her great wide eyes whose clear depths were like pools of living star fires,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3739,3486-166424-0034,they shone from her white face not phosphorescent not merely lucent and light reflecting but as though they themselves were sources of the cold white flames of far stars and as calm as those stars themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3740,3486-166424-0035,and in that face although as yet i could distinguish nothing but the eyes i sensed something unearthly god whispered ventnor what is she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3744,3486-166424-0039,they stood in silence like automatons only their fiercely staring eyes showing that they were alive quick breathed ventnor we ran toward her who had checked death even while its jaws were closing upon us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3745,3486-166424-0040,before we had gone half way as though our flight had broken whatever bonds had bound them a clamor arose from the host a wild shouting a clanging of swords on shields i shot a glance behind they were in motion advancing slowly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3746,3486-166424-0041,hesitatingly as yet but i knew that soon that hesitation would pass that they would sweep down upon us engulf us to the crevice i shouted to drake he paid no heed to me nor did ruth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3748,3486-166424-0043,from the lifted throat came a low a vibrant cry harmonious weirdly disquieting golden and sweet and laden with the eery minor wailings of the blue valley's night the dragoned chamber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3749,3486-166424-0044,before the cry had ceased there poured with incredible swiftness out of the crevice score upon score of the metal things the fissures vomited them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3750,3486-166424-0045,globes and cubes and pyramids not small like those of the ruins but shapes all of four feet high dully lustrous and deep within that luster the myriads of tiny points of light like unwinking staring eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3751,3486-166424-0046,they swirled eddied and formed a barricade between us and the armored men down upon them poured a shower of arrows from the soldiers i heard the shouts of their captains they rushed they had courage those men yes again came the woman's cry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3753,3486-166424-0048,eight feet in width and twenty feet high it shaped itself out from its left side from right side sprang arms fearful arms that grew and grew as globe and cube and angle raced up the column's side and clicked into place each upon each after the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3754,3486-166424-0049,with magical quickness the arms lengthened before us stood a monstrous shape a geometric prodigy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3755,3486-166424-0050,a shining angled pillar that though rigid immobile seemed to crouch be instinct with living force striving to be unleashed two great globes surmounted it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3756,3486-166424-0051,flexing themselves in grotesque imitation of a boxer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3757,3486-166424-0052,again in gigantic awful parody of the spiked gloves of those ancient gladiators who fought for imperial nero,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3758,3486-166424-0053,preening testing itself like an athlete,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3759,3486-166424-0054,under the darkening sky in the green of the hollow the armored hosts frozen before it and then it struck out flashed two of the arms with a glancing motion with appalling force,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3760,3486-166424-0055,they sliced into the close packed forward ranks of the armored men cut out of them two great gaps sickened i saw fragments of man and horse fly another arm javelined from its place like a flying snake clicked at the end of another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3761,3486-166424-0056,became a hundred foot chain which swirled like a flail through the huddling mass down upon a knot of the soldiers with a straight forward blow drove a third arm driving through them like a giant punch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3762,3486-166424-0057,all that host which had driven us from the ruins threw down sword spear and pike fled shrieking the horsemen spurred their mounts riding heedless over the footmen who fled with them the smiting thing seemed to watch them go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3763,3486-166424-0058,with amusement before they could cover a hundred yards it had disintegrated i heard the little wailing sounds then behind the fleeing men close behind them rose the angled pillar into place sprang the flexing arms and again it took its toll of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3764,3486-166424-0059,they scattered running singly by twos in little groups for the sides of the valley they were like rats scampering in panic over the bottom of a great green bowl and like a monstrous cat the shape played with them yes played,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3765,3486-166424-0060,it melted once more took new form where had been pillar and flailing arms was now a tripod thirty feet high its legs alternate globe and cube and upon its apex a wide and spinning ring of sparkling spheres,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3766,3486-166424-0061,out from the middle of this ring stretched a tentacle writhing undulating like a serpent of steel four score yards at least in length,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3767,3486-166424-0062,with the three long prongs of this trident the thing struck swiftly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3768,3486-166424-0063,it was i think that last touch of sheer horror the playfulness of the smiting thing that sent my dry tongue to the roof of my terror parched mouth and held open with monstrous fascination eyes that struggled to close,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3769,3486-166424-0064,ever the armored men fled from it and ever was it swifter than they teetering at their heels on its tripod legs from half its length the darting snake streamed red rain i heard a sigh from ruth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3770,3486-166424-0065,wrested my gaze from the hollow turned she lay fainting in drake's arms beside the two the swathed woman stood looking out upon that slaughter calm and still shrouded with an unearthly tranquillity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3771,3486-166424-0066,viewing it it came to me with eyes impersonal cold indifferent as the untroubled stars which look down upon hurricane and earthquake in this world of ours there was a rushing of many feet at our left a wail from chiu ming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3772,3486-166424-0067,were they maddened by fear driven by despair determined to slay before they themselves were slain i do not know but those who still lived of the men from the tunnel mouth were charging us they clustered close their shields held before them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3773,3486-166424-0068,they had no bows these men they moved swiftly down upon us in silence swords and pikes gleaming the smiting thing rocked toward us the metal tentacle straining out like a rigid racing serpent flying to cut between its weird mistress and those who menaced her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3775,3486-166424-0070,i saw a spear thrown it struck the chinaman squarely in the breast he tottered fell upon his knees even as he dropped the giant flail swept down upon the soldiers it swept through them like a scythe through ripe grain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3776,3486-166424-0071,it threw them broken and torn far toward the valley's sloping sides it left only fragments that bore no semblance to men ventnor was at chiu ming's head i dropped beside him there was a crimson froth upon his lips,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3778,3486-166424-0073,at the side of the crevice stood the woman her gaze resting upon drake his arms about ruth her head hidden on his breast the valley was empty save for the huddled heaps that dotted it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3779,3486-166424-0074,high up on the mountain path a score of figures crept all that were left of those who but a little before had streamed down to take us captive or to slay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3780,3486-166424-0075,high up in the darkening heavens the lammergeiers the winged scavengers of the himalayas were gathering the woman lifted her hand beckoned us once more slowly we walked toward her stood before her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3782,125-121124-0001,which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3795,125-121124-0014,less owing to his social position than to his personal merit the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3929,7059-77897-0010,before the massive black walnut doors the ladies were shown into the music room from which the notes of a piano were sounding when they rang and missus wilmington rose from the instrument to meet them a young man who had been standing beside her turned away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3930,7059-77897-0011,missus wilmington was dressed in a light morning dress with a watteau fall whose delicate russets and faded reds and yellows heightened the richness of her complexion and hair why annie she said how glad i am to see you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3931,7059-77897-0012,and you too missus munger how vurry nice her words took value from the thick mellow tones of her voice and passed for much more than they were worth intrinsically,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3932,7059-77897-0013,we had the furnace lighted yesterday and we've been in all the morning and so we hadn't noticed jack won't you shut the register she drawled over her shoulder this is my nephew mister jack wilmington miss kilburn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3933,7059-77897-0014,mister wilmington and missus munger are old friends the young fellow bowed silently and annie instantly took a dislike to him his heavy jaw long eyes and low forehead almost hidden under a thick bang he sat down cornerwise on a chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3934,7059-77897-0015,and having previously committed missus wilmington in favour of the general scheme asked her what she thought of that part mister jack wilmington answered for her i should think you had a right to do what you please about it it's none of the hands business if you don't choose to ask them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3935,7059-77897-0016,yes that's what any one would think in the abstract said missus munger now little boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3936,7059-77897-0017,putting out a silencing hand in the direction of the young man don't you be so fast you let your aunty speak for herself i don't know about not letting the hands stay to the dance and supper missus munger you know i might feel put upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3937,7059-77897-0018,i used to be one of the hands myself yes annie there was a time after you went away and after father died when i actually fell so low as to work for an honest living i think i heard lyra said annie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3938,7059-77897-0019,but i had forgotten the fact in connection with what had been said made her still more uncomfortable well i didn't work very hard and i didn't have to work long but i was a hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3939,7059-77897-0020,and there's no use trying to deny it as mister putney says he and i have our record and we don't have to make any pretences and the question is whether i ought to go back on my fellow hands oh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3940,7059-77897-0021,but missus wilmington said missus munger with intense deprecation that's such a very different thing you were not brought up to it it was just temporary and besides and besides,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3941,7059-77897-0022,but i don't know annie whether i oughtn't to remember my low beginnings i suppose we all like to be consistent answered annie aimlessly uneasily yes missus munger broke in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3942,7059-77897-0023,but i guess i must oppose the little invited dance and supper on principle we all like to be consistent as annie says even if we're inconsistent in the attempt she added with a laugh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3943,7059-77897-0024,very well then exclaimed missus munger we'll drop them as i said to miss kilburn on our way here if missus wilmington is opposed to them we'll drop them oh am i such an,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3944,7059-77897-0025,influential person said missus wilmington with a shrug it's rather awful isn't it annie not at all missus munger answered for annie we've just been talking the matter over with mister putney and doctor morrell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3945,7059-77897-0026,and they're both opposed you're merely the straw that breaks the camel's back missus wilmington oh thank you that's a great relief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3946,7059-77897-0027,well i must think about that and i must ask mister wilmington jack she called over her shoulder to the young man at the window do you think your uncle would approve of me as juliet's nurse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3947,7059-77897-0028,you'd better ask him growled the young fellow well said missus wilmington with another laugh i'll think it over missus munger thank you said missus munger and now we must really be going,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3948,7059-77897-0029,she added pulling out her watch by its leathern guard not till you've had lunch said missus wilmington rising with the ladies you must stay annie i shall not excuse you well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3949,7059-77897-0030,will you join us jack no i'm going to the office said the nephew bowing himself out of the room jack's learning to be superintendent said missus wilmington lifting her teasing voice to make him hear her in the hall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3950,7059-77897-0031,and he's been spending the whole morning here in the richly appointed dining room a glitter of china and glass and a mass of carven oak the table was laid for two put another plate norah,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3951,7059-77897-0032,said missus wilmington carelessly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3952,7059-77900-0000,miss northwick called upon annie during the week with excuses for her delay and for coming alone she seemed to have intentions of being polite but she constantly betrayed her want of interest in annie and disappointed an expectation of refinement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3953,7059-77900-0001,which her physical delicacy awakened she asked her how she ever came to take up the social union and answered for her that of course it had the attraction of the theatricals and went on to talk of her sister's part in them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3954,7059-77900-0002,the relation of the northwick family to the coming entertainment and an impression of frail mottled wrists and high thin cheeks and an absence of modelling under affluent drapery was the main effect of miss northwick's visit when annie returned it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3955,7059-77900-0003,she met the younger sister whom she found a great beauty she seemed very cold and of a hauteur which she subdued with difficulty but she was more consecutively polite than her sister and annie watched with fascination her turns of the head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3956,7059-77900-0004,her movements of leopard swiftness and elasticity the changing lights of her complexion the curves of her fine lips the fluttering of her thin nostrils a very new basket phaeton stood glittering at annie's door when she got home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3957,7059-77900-0005,and missus wilmington put her head out of the open parlour window how d'ye do annie she drawled in her tender voice won't you come in you see i'm in possession,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3958,7059-77900-0006,i've just got my new phaeton and i drove up at once to crush you with it isn't it a beauty you're too late lyra said annie i've just come from the northwicks and another crushing beauty has got in ahead of your phaeton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3959,7059-77900-0007,oh poor annie lyra began to laugh with agreeable intelligence do come in and tell me about it why is that girl going to take part in the theatricals she doesn't care to please any one does she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3960,7059-77900-0008,do you mean it lyra demanded annie arrested on her threshold by the charm of this improbability well i don't know they're opposites but upon second thoughts you needn't come in annie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3961,7059-77900-0009,i want you to take a drive with me and try my new phaeton said lyra coming out annie now looked at it with that irresolution of hers and lyra commanded get right in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3962,7059-77900-0010,we'll go down to the works you've never met my husband yet have you annie no i haven't lyra i've always just missed him somehow he seems to have been perpetually just gone to town or not got back well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3963,7059-77900-0011,he's really at home now and i don't mean at the house which isn't home to him but the works you've never seen the works either have you no i haven't well then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3964,7059-77900-0012,we'll just go round there and kill two birds with one stone i ought to show off my new phaeton to mister wilmington first of all he gave it to me it would be kind of conjugal or filial or something,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3965,7059-77900-0013,you know mister wilmington and i are not exactly contemporaries annie i heard he was somewhat your senior said annie reluctantly lyra laughed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3966,7059-77900-0014,they came round into the region of the shops and lyra checked her pony in front of her husband's factory it was not imposingly large but as missus wilmington caused annie to observe it was as big as the hat shops and as ugly as the shoe shops,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3967,7059-77900-0015,the structure trembled with the operation of its industry and as they mounted the wooden steps to the open outside door an inner door swung ajar for a moment and let out a roar mingled of the hum and whirl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3968,7059-77900-0016,and finding its first apartment empty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3969,7059-77900-0017,where her husband sat writing at a table george i want to introduce you to miss kilburn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3970,7059-77900-0018,with the habit he had of touching it there with the tip of his tongue made annie think of a cat that had been at the cream i've been hoping to call with missus wilmington to pay my respects but i've been away a great deal this season and and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3971,7059-77900-0019,we're all very happy to have you home again miss kilburn i've often heard my wife speak of your old days together at hatboro they fenced with some polite feints of interest in each other the old man standing beside his writing table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3972,7059-77900-0020,and staying himself with a shaking hand upon it lyra interrupted them well i think now that annie is here we'd better not let her get away without showing her the works oh oh decidedly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3973,7059-77900-0021,i'll go with you with great pleasure ah he bustled about putting the things together on his table and then reaching for the panama hat on a hook behind it there was something pathetic in his eagerness to do what lyra bade him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3974,7059-77900-0022,i'll show them through he said to his uncle and the old man assented with well perhaps you'd better jack and went back to his room the wilmington stocking mills spun their own threads,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3975,7059-77900-0023,and the first room was like what annie had seen before in cotton factories with a faint smell of oil from the machinery and a fine snow of fluff in the air and catching to the white washed walls and the foul window sashes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3976,7059-77900-0024,the tireless machines marched back and forth across the floor and the men who watched them with suicidal intensity ran after them barefooted when they made off with a broken thread spliced it and then escaped from them to their stations again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3977,7059-77900-0025,they looked after lyra and her nephew from under cotton frowsed bangs they all seemed to know her and returned her easy kindly greetings with an effect of liking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3978,7059-77900-0026,from time to time at lyra's bidding the young fellow explained to annie some curious feature of the processes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3979,7059-77900-0027,except when jack wilmington curtly ordered them to do this or that in illustration of some point he was explaining she wearied herself as people do in such places in expressing her wonder at the ingenuity of the machinery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3980,7059-77900-0028,it was a relief to get away from it all into the room cool and quiet where half a dozen neat girls were counting and stamping the stockings with different numbers here's where i used to work said lyra,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3981,7059-77900-0029,and here's where i first met mister wilmington the place is full of romantic associations the stockings are all one size annie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3982,7059-77900-0030,i don't well they're not dreams exactly annie when all's said and done for them when they left the mill she asked annie to come home to tea with her saying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3983,7059-77900-0031,as if from a perception of her dislike for the young fellow that jack was going to boston they had a long evening together after mister wilmington took himself off after tea to his study as he called it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3984,7059-77900-0032,and remained shut in there annie was uneasily aware of him from time to time but lyra had apparently no more disturbance from his absence than from his presence which she had managed with a frank acceptance of everything it suggested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4013,7059-88364-0018,part of the thinness of california is not only its youth but the result of the physical fact that the human race is there spread over so many acres of land they try not only to count their mines and enumerate their palm trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4014,7059-88364-0019,but they count the miles of their sea coast and the acres under cultivation and the height of the peaks and revel in large statistics and the bigness generally and forget how a few men rattle around in a great deal of scenery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4018,7059-88364-0023,when the californian relegates the dramatic to secondary scenes both in his life and his photoplay and turns to the genuinely epic and lyric,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4022,7059-88364-0027,here is where the photoplay can begin to give him a more delicate utterance and he can go on into stranger things and evolve all the splendor films into higher types for the very name of california is splendor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4026,7059-88364-0031,it is possible for los angeles to lay hold of the motion picture as our national text book in art as boston appropriated to herself the guardianship of the national text books of literature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4030,1737-142396-0000,i can see now that to children with a proper equipment of parents these things would have worn a different aspect but to those whose nearest were aunts and uncles a special attitude of mind may be allowed they treated us indeed with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4032,1737-142396-0002,but only a certain blend of envy of their good luck and pity for their inability to make use of it indeed it was one of the most hopeless features in their character when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them which wasn't often,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4033,1737-142396-0003,they were free to issue forth and buy gunpowder in the full eye of the sun free to fire cannons and explode mines on the lawn yet they never did any one of these things no irresistible energy haled them to church o sundays,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4034,1737-142396-0004,yet they went there regularly of their own accord though they betrayed no greater delight in the experience than ourselves on the whole the existence of these olympians seemed to be entirely void of interests,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4035,1737-142396-0005,even as their movements were confined and slow and their habits stereotyped and senseless to anything but appearances they were blind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4037,1737-142396-0007,though the whole place swarmed with such portents they cared not about exploring for robbers caves nor digging for hidden treasure perhaps indeed it was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of their time stuffily indoors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4038,1737-142396-0008,there was an exception in the curate who would receive unblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo which it was our delight moccasined and tomahawked to ride down with those whoops that announce the scenting of blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4039,1737-142396-0009,he neither laughed nor sneered as the olympians would have done but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4040,1737-142396-0010,then too he was always ready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding indians on the shortest possible notice in brief a distinctly able man with talents so far as we could judge immensely above the majority,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4041,1737-142396-0011,i trust he is a bishop by this time he had all the necessary qualifications as we knew these strange folk had visitors sometimes stiff and colourless olympians like themselves equally without vital interests and intelligent pursuits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4042,1737-142396-0012,emerging out of the clouds and passing away again to drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our ken then brute force was pitilessly applied we were captured washed and forced into clean collars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4092,1737-142397-0020,i ran sideways shouting i dug glad heels into the squelching soil i splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick i hurled clods skywards at random and presently i somehow found myself singing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4093,1737-142397-0021,a weary unrhythmic thing of rise and fall and yet it seemed to me a genuine utterance and just at that moment the one thing fitting and right and perfect humanity would have rejected it with scorn nature everywhere singing in the same key,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4094,1737-142397-0022,recognised and accepted it without a flicker of dissent all the time the hearty wind was calling to me companionably from where he swung and bellowed in the tree tops,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4095,1737-142397-0023,a belated truant you have dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale expressionless moon for company to day why not i the trickster the hypocrite i who whip round corners and bluster relapse and evade then rally and pursue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4096,1737-142397-0024,i can lead you the best and rarest dance of any for i am the strong capricious one the lord of misrule and i alone am irresponsible and unprincipled and obey no law and for me i was ready enough to fall in with the fellow's humour was not this a whole holiday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4097,1737-142397-0025,so we sheered off together arm in arm so to speak and with fullest confidence i took the jigging thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me a whimsical comrade i found him ere he had done with me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4098,1737-142397-0026,silent face to face o'er a discreet unwinking stile as a rule this sort of thing struck me as the most pitiful tomfoolery two calves rubbing noses through a gate were natural and right and within the order of things but that human beings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4100,1737-142397-0028,and it was with a certain surprise that i found myself regarding these fatuous ones with kindliness instead of contempt as i rambled by unheeded of them there was indeed some reconciling influence abroad which could bring the like antics into harmony with bud and growth and the frolic air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4101,1737-142397-0029,and presently i came in sight of the village church sitting solitary within its circle of elms from forth the vestry window projected two small legs gyrating hungry for foothold with larceny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4102,1737-142397-0030,bill's coveted booty too i could easily guess at that it came from the vicar's store of biscuits kept as i knew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4103,1737-142397-0031,then i passed on my way i protest i was not on bill's side but then neither was i on the vicar's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4104,1737-142397-0032,and i felt sure as i rambled off in his wake that he had more holiday matter to show me and so indeed he had and all of it was to the same lawless tune like a black pirate flag on the blue ocean of air a hawk hung ominous then plummet wise dropped to the hedgerow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4105,1737-142397-0033,whence there rose thin and shrill a piteous voice of squealing by the time i got there a whisk of feathers on the turf like scattered playbills was all that remained to tell of the tragedy just enacted yet nature smiled and sang on pitiless gay impartial,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4106,1737-142397-0034,to her who took no sides there was every bit as much to be said for the hawk as for the chaffinch both were her children and she would show no preferences further on a hedgehog lay dead athwart the path nay more than dead decadent distinctly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4240,27-123349-0005,and expected that they would now rise by hundreds of thousands to welcome him he remembered the good will which the soldiers had always borne him and flattered himself that they would come over to him by regiments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4241,27-123349-0006,encouraging messages reached him in quick succession from london he was assured that the violence and injustice with which the elections had been carried on had driven the nation mad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4242,27-123349-0007,that the prudence of the leading whigs had with difficulty prevented a sanguinary outbreak on the day of the coronation and that all the great lords who had supported the exclusion bill were impatient to rally round him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4243,27-123349-0008,wildman who loved to talk treason in parables sent to say that the earl of richmond just two hundred years before had landed in england with a handful of men and had a few days later been crowned on the field of bosworth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4244,27-123349-0009,all that was required of him was to promise that he would not assume the regal title,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4245,27-123349-0010,it was determined that two englishmen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4246,27-123349-0011,should accompany argyle to scotland and that fletcher should go with monmouth to england fletcher from the beginning had augured ill of the enterprise but his chivalrous spirit would not suffer him to decline a risk which his friends seemed eager to encounter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4247,27-123349-0012,when grey repeated with approbation what wildman had said about richmond and richard the well read and thoughtful scot justly remarked that there was a great difference between the fifteenth century and the seventeenth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4248,27-123349-0013,richmond was assured of the support of barons each of whom could bring an army of feudal retainers into the field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4249,27-123349-0014,a sum sufficient for the two expeditions very little was obtained from london six thousand pounds had been expected thence but instead of the money came excuses from wildman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4250,27-123349-0015,but his intellect and his temper preserved him from the violence of a partisan he had lived on confidential terms with shaftesbury and had thus incurred the displeasure of the court locke's prudence had however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4251,27-123349-0016,been such that it would have been to little purpose to bring him even before the corrupt and partial tribunals of that age in one point however he was vulnerable he was a student of christ church in the university of oxford,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4252,27-123349-0017,but this was not easy locke had at oxford abstained from expressing any opinion on the politics of the day spies had been set about him doctors of divinity and masters of arts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4253,27-123349-0018,to the exclusion bill and to the character of the earl of shaftesbury but in vain locke neither broke out nor dissembled but maintained such steady silence and composure as forced the tools of power to own with vexation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4254,27-123349-0019,that never man was so complete a master of his tongue and of his passions when it was found that treachery could do nothing arbitrary power was used after vainly trying to inveigle locke into a fault,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4255,27-123349-0020,the government resolved to punish him without one orders came from whitehall that he should be ejected and those orders the dean and canons made haste to obey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4256,27-123349-0021,locke was travelling on the continent for his health when he learned that he had been deprived of his home and of his bread without a trial or even a notice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4257,27-123349-0022,the injustice with which he had been treated would have excused him if he had resorted to violent methods of redress but he was not to be blinded by personal resentment he augured no good from the schemes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4258,27-123349-0023,but it was apprehended that argyle would shortly appear in arms among his clansmen a proclamation was accordingly issued directing that scotland should be put into a state of defence the militia was ordered to be in readiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4259,27-123349-0024,all the clans hostile to the name of campbell were set in motion john murray marquess of athol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4260,27-123349-0025,and at the head of a great body of his followers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4261,27-123349-0026,who had long resided in england as ambassador from the united provinces and everard van dykvelt who after the death of charles had been sent by the state general on a special mission of condolence and congratulation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4262,27-123349-0027,the king said that he had received from unquestionable sources intelligence of designs which were forming against the throne by his banished subjects in holland some of the exiles were cutthroats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4263,27-123349-0028,whom nothing but the special providence of god had prevented from committing a foul murder and among them was the owner of the spot which had been fixed for the butchery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4264,27-123349-0029,argyle has the greatest means of annoying me and of all places holland is that whence a blow may be best aimed against me the dutch envoys assured his majesty that what he had said should instantly be communicated to the government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4265,27-123349-0030,were at this time most desirous that the hospitality of their country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4266,27-123349-0031,james had lately held language which encouraged the hope that he would not patiently submit to the ascendancy of france it seemed probable that he would consent to form a close alliance with the united provinces and the house of austria,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4267,27-123349-0032,there was therefore at the hague an extreme anxiety to avoid all that could give him offence the personal interest of william was also on this occasion identical with the interest of his father in law,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4268,27-123349-0033,but the case was one which required rapid and vigorous action and the nature of the batavian institutions made such action almost impossible the union of utrecht,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4269,27-123349-0034,for the purpose of meeting immediate exigencies had never been deliberately revised and perfected in a time of tranquillity every one of the seven commonwealths,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4270,27-123349-0035,which that union had bound together retained almost all the rights of sovereignty and asserted those rights punctiliously against the central government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4271,27-123349-0036,as the federal authorities had not the means of exacting prompt obedience from the provincial authorities so the provincial authorities had not the means of exacting prompt obedience from the municipal authorities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4272,27-123349-0037,holland alone contained eighteen cities each of which was for many purposes an independent state jealous of all interference from without if the rulers of such a city received from the hague an order,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4273,27-123349-0038,which was unpleasing to them they either neglected it altogether or executed it languidly and tardily in some town councils indeed the influence of the prince of orange was all powerful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4274,27-123349-0039,but unfortunately the place where the british exiles had congregated and where their ships had been fitted out was the rich and populous amsterdam and the magistrates of amsterdam were the heads of the faction hostile to the federal government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4275,27-123349-0040,and to the house of nassau the naval administration of the united provinces was conducted by five distinct boards of admiralty one of those boards sate at amsterdam was partly nominated by the authorities of that city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4276,27-123349-0041,and seems to have been entirely animated by their spirit all the endeavours of the federal government to effect what james desired were frustrated by the evasions of the functionaries of amsterdam and by the blunders of colonel bevil skelton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4277,27-123349-0042,then instead of applying as he should have done to the states general who sate close to his own door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4278,27-123349-0043,with a request that the suspected ships might be detained the magistrates of amsterdam answered that the entrance of the zuyder zee was out of their jurisdiction and referred him to the federal government it was notorious that this was a mere excuse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4279,27-123349-0044,and that if there had been any real wish at the stadthouse of amsterdam to prevent argyle from sailing no difficulties would have been made skelton now addressed himself to the states general they showed every disposition to comply with his demand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4280,27-123349-0045,departed from the course which they ordinarily observed in the transaction of business on the same day on which he made his application to them an order drawn in exact conformity with his request,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4281,27-123349-0046,was despatched to the admiralty of amsterdam but this order in consequence of some misinformation did not correctly describe the situation of the ships they were said to be in the texel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4282,27-123349-0047,would in a moment have put an end to his expedition round his little fleet a boat was rowing in which were some persons with telescopes whom he suspected to be spies but no effectual step was taken for the purpose of detaining him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4283,27-123349-0048,and on the afternoon of the second of may he stood out to sea before a favourable breeze the voyage was prosperous on the sixth the orkneys were in sight argyle very unwisely anchored off kirkwall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4284,27-123349-0049,and allowed two of his followers to go on shore there the bishop ordered them to be arrested the refugees proceeded to hold a long and animated debate on this misadventure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4285,27-123349-0050,for from the beginning to the end of their expedition however languid and irresolute their conduct might be they never in debate wanted spirit or perseverance some were for an attack on kirkwall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4286,27-123349-0051,some were for proceeding without delay to argyleshire at last the earl seized some gentlemen who lived near the coast of the island and proposed to the bishop an exchange of prisoners the bishop returned no answer and the fleet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4287,27-123349-0052,after losing three days sailed away this delay was full of danger it was speedily known at edinburgh that the rebel squadron had touched at the orkneys troops were instantly put in motion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4288,27-123349-0053,when the earl reached his own province he found that preparations had been made to repel him at dunstaffnage he sent his second son charles on shore to call the campbells to arms but charles returned with gloomy tidings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4289,27-123349-0054,the herdsmen and fishermen were indeed ready to rally round mac callum more but of the heads of the clan some were in confinement and others had fled those gentlemen who remained at their homes were either well affected to the government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4290,27-123349-0055,or afraid of moving and refused even to see the son of their chief from dunstaffnage the small armament proceeded to campbelltown near the southern extremity of the peninsula of kintyre,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4291,27-123349-0056,here the earl published a manifesto drawn up in holland under the direction of the committee by james stewart a scotch advocate whose pen was a few months later employed in a very different way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4292,27-123349-0057,in this paper were set forth with a strength of language sometimes approaching to scurrility many real and some imaginary grievances it was hinted that the late king had died by poison,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4293,27-123349-0058,a chief object of the expedition was declared to be the entire suppression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4294,4406-16882-0000,belonging to our garrison but none of them would stir though another time if any indian had come to the door they were ready to fly upon him and tear him down the lord hereby would make us the more acknowledge his hand and to see that our help is always in him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4296,4406-16882-0002,in or near the throat fell down dead whereat the indians scornfully shouted and hallowed and were presently upon him stripping off his clothes the bullets flying thick one went through my side and the same as would seem,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4297,4406-16882-0003,through the bowels and hand of my dear child in my arms one of my elder sisters children named william had then his leg broken which the indians perceiving they knocked him on his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4298,4406-16882-0004,standing amazed with the blood running down to our heels my eldest sister being yet in the house and seeing those woeful sights the infidels hauling mothers one way and children another and some wallowing in their blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4299,4406-16882-0005,and her elder son telling her that her son william was dead and myself was wounded she said and lord let me die with them which was no sooner said but she was struck with a bullet and fell down dead over the threshold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4300,4406-16882-0006,i hope she is reaping the fruit of her good labors being faithful to the service of god in her place in her younger years she lay under much trouble upon spiritual accounts till it pleased god to make that precious scripture take hold of her heart and he said unto me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4301,4406-16882-0007,oh the doleful sight that now was to behold at this house come behold the works of the lord,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4302,4406-16882-0008,and relations lie bleeding out their heart blood upon the ground there was one who was chopped into the head with a hatchet and stripped naked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4303,4406-16882-0009,as if they would have torn our very hearts out yet the lord by his almighty power preserved a number of us from death for there were twenty four of us taken alive and carried captive i had often before this said that if the indians should come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4304,4406-16882-0010,i should choose rather to be killed by them than taken alive but when it came to the trial my mind changed their glittering weapons so daunted my spirit that i chose rather to go along with those as i may say ravenous beasts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4305,4406-16882-0011,than that moment to end my days and that i may the better declare what happened to me during that grievous captivity i shall particularly speak of the several removes we had up and down the wilderness the first remove now away we must go with those barbarous creatures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4306,4406-16882-0012,with our bodies wounded and bleeding and our hearts no less than our bodies about a mile we went that night up upon a hill within sight of the town where they intended to lodge there was hard by a vacant house deserted by the english before for fear of the indians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4307,4406-16882-0013,i asked them whether i might not lodge in the house that night to which they answered what will you love english men still this was the dolefulest night that ever my eyes saw oh the roaring and singing and dancing and yelling of those black creatures in the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4308,4406-16882-0014,some roasting some lying and burning and some boiling to feed our merciless enemies who were joyful enough though we were disconsolate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4309,4406-16882-0015,and the dismalness of the present night my thoughts ran upon my losses and sad bereaved condition all was gone my husband gone at least separated from me he being in the bay and to add to my grief the indians told me they would kill him as he came homeward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4310,4406-16882-0016,my children gone my relations and friends gone our house and home and all our comforts within door and without all was gone except my life and i knew not but the next moment that might go too there remained nothing to me but one poor wounded babe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4311,4406-16882-0017,and it seemed at present worse than death that it was in such a pitiful condition bespeaking compassion and i had no refreshing for it nor suitable things to revive it little do many think what is the savageness and brutishness of this barbarous enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4312,4406-16882-0018,by one eyed john and marlborough's praying indians which captain mosely brought to boston as the indians told me the second remove but now the next morning i must turn my back upon the town and travel with them into the vast and desolate wilderness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4313,4406-16882-0019,i knew not whither it is not my tongue or pen can express the sorrows of my heart and bitterness of my spirit that i had at this departure but god was with me in a wonderful manner carrying me along and bearing up my spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4314,4406-16882-0020,that it did not quite fail one of the indians carried my poor wounded babe upon a horse it went moaning all along i shall die i shall die i went on foot after it with sorrow that cannot be expressed at length i took it off the horse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4315,4406-16882-0021,and carried it in my arms till my strength failed and i fell down with it then they set me upon a horse with my wounded child in my lap and there being no furniture upon the horse's back as we were going down a steep hill we both fell over the horse's head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4316,4406-16882-0022,at which they like inhumane creatures laughed and rejoiced to see it though i thought we should there have ended our days as overcome with so many difficulties but the lord renewed my strength still and carried me along that i might see more of his power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4317,4406-16882-0023,by a little fire and a few boughs behind me with my sick child in my lap,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4318,4406-16882-0024,my own wound also growing so stiff that i could scarce sit down or rise up yet so it must be that i must sit all this cold winter night upon the cold snowy ground with my sick child in my arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4319,4406-16882-0025,and we were both alive to see the light of the next morning the third remove,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4320,4406-16882-0026,one of the indians got up upon a horse and they set me up behind him with my poor sick babe in my lap a very wearisome and tedious day i had of it what with my own wound and my child's being so exceeding sick and in a lamentable condition with her wound,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4321,4406-16882-0027,this day in the afternoon about an hour by sun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4322,4406-16882-0028,my wounds stink and are corrupt i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long i sat much alone with a poor wounded child in my lap which moaned night and day having nothing to revive the body or cheer the spirits of her but instead of that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4323,4406-16882-0029,in this miserable condition without any refreshing of one nature or other except a little cold water i cannot but take notice how at another time i could not bear to be in the room where any dead person was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4324,4406-16882-0030,by my master in this writing must be understood quinnapin who was a sagamore and married king philip's wife's sister not that he first took me but i was sold to him by another narragansett indian who took me when first i came out of the garrison,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4325,4406-16882-0031,there was no resisting but go i must and leave it when i had been at my master's wigwam,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4326,4406-16882-0032,when i came i asked them what they had done with it then they told me it was upon the hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4327,4406-16882-0033,and there they told me they had buried it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4328,4406-16882-0034,god having taken away this dear child i went to see my daughter mary who was at this same indian town at a wigwam not very far off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4329,4406-16882-0035,she was about ten years old and taken from the door at first by a praying indiana and afterward sold for a gun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4330,4406-16882-0036,and ye will take benjamin also all these things are against me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4331,4406-16882-0037,and as i was going along my heart was even overwhelmed with the thoughts of my condition and that i should have children and a nation which i knew not ruled over them whereupon i earnestly entreated the lord that he would consider my low estate and show me a token for good and if it were his blessed will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4332,4406-16882-0038,i had not seen him before since the destruction of the town and i knew not where he was till i was informed by himself that he was amongst a smaller parcel of indians whose place was about six miles off with tears in his eyes he asked me whether his sister sarah was dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4333,4406-16882-0039,and told me he had seen his sister mary and prayed me that i would not be troubled in reference to himself the occasion of his coming to see me at this time was this there was as i said about six miles from us a small plantation of indians where it seems he had been during his captivity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4334,4406-16882-0040,all the company for those that belonged to the other small company came through the town that now we were at but before they came to us oh the outrageous roaring and hooping that there was they began their din about a mile before they came to us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4335,4406-16882-0041,by their noise and hooping they signified how many they had destroyed which was at that time twenty three,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4336,4406-16882-0042,and every time that the other went over their number these at home gave a shout that the very earth rung again and thus they continued till those that had been upon the expedition were come up to the sagamore's wigwam and then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4337,4406-16882-0043,i cannot but take notice of the wonderful mercy of god to me in those afflictions in sending me a bible one of the indians that came from medfield fight had brought some plunder came to me and asked me if i would have a bible he had got one in his basket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4338,4406-16882-0044,and turn all those curses upon our enemies i do not desire to live to forget this scripture and what comfort it was to me now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4339,4406-16882-0045,some one way and some another there were now besides myself nine english captives in this place all of them children except one woman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4340,4406-16882-0046,they being to go one way and i another i asked them whether they were earnest with god for deliverance they told me they did as they were able and it was some comfort to me that the lord stirred up children to look to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4341,4406-16882-0047,i wished her not to run away by any means for we were near thirty miles from any english town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4342,4406-16882-0048,and another child in her arms two years old and bad rivers there were to go over and we were feeble with our poor and coarse entertainment i had my bible with me i pulled it out and asked her whether she would read,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4343,4406-16882-0049,be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord the fourth remove and now i must part with that little company i had,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4344,4406-16882-0050,she would be often asking the indians to let her go home they not being willing to that and yet vexed with her importunity gathered a great company together about her and stripped her naked and set her in the midst of them and when they had sung and danced about her in their hellish manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4345,4406-16882-0051,as long as they pleased they knocked her on head and the child in her arms with her when they had done that they made a fire and put them both into it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4346,4406-16882-0052,the children said she did not shed one tear but prayed all the while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4347,4406-16882-0053,we came about the middle of the afternoon to this place cold and wet and snowy and hungry and weary and no refreshing for man but the cold ground to sit on and our poor indian cheer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4348,4406-16882-0054,this was a sweet cordial to me when i was ready to faint many and many a time have i sat down and wept sweetly over this scripture at this place we continued about four days the fifth remove,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4349,4406-16882-0055,and then they made a stop and chose some of their stoutest men and sent them back to hold the english army in play whilst the rest escaped and then like jehu they marched on furiously with their old and with their young some carried their old decrepit mothers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4350,4406-16882-0056,some carried one and some another four of them carried a great indian upon a bier but going through a thick wood with him they were hindered and could make no haste whereupon they took him upon their backs and carried him one at a time till,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4351,4406-16882-0057,upon a friday a little after noon we came to this river,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4352,4406-16882-0058,and were gathered together i thought to count the number of them but they were so many and being somewhat in motion it was beyond my skill in this travel because of my wound i was somewhat favored in my load i carried only my knitting work and two quarts of parched meal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4353,4406-16882-0059,being very faint i asked my mistress to give me one spoonful of the meal but she would not give me a taste they quickly fell to cutting dry trees to make rafts to carry them over the river and soon my turn came to go over by the advantage of some brush,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4354,4406-16882-0060,which they had laid upon the raft to sit upon i did not wet my foot which many of themselves at the other end were mid leg deep which cannot but be acknowledged as a favor of god to my weakened body it being a very cold time i was not before acquainted with such,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4355,4406-16882-0061,the first week of my being among them i hardly ate any thing the second week i found my stomach grow very faint for want of something and yet it was very hard to get down their filthy trash but the third week,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4356,4406-16882-0062,i told them it was the sabbath day and desired them to let me rest and told them i would do as much more tomorrow to which they answered me they would break my face and here i cannot but take notice of the strange providence of god in preserving the heathen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4357,4406-16882-0063,they were many hundreds old and young some sick and some lame many had papooses at their backs the greatest number at this time with us were squaws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4358,4406-16882-0064,if we had been god would have found out a way for the english to have passed this river as well as for the indians with their squaws and children and all their luggage oh that my people had hearkened to me and israel had walked in my ways,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4359,4406-16882-0065,they set their wigwams on fire and went away it was a cold morning and before us there was a great brook with ice on it some waded through it up to the knees and higher but others went till they came to a beaver dam and i amongst them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4360,4406-16882-0066,we came that day to a great swamp by the side of which we took up our lodging that night when i came to the brow of the hill that looked toward the swamp i thought we had been come to a great indian town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4361,4406-16882-0067,though there were none but our own company the indians were as thick as the trees it seemed as if there had been a thousand hatchets going at once if one looked before one there was nothing but indians and behind one nothing but indians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4362,4406-16882-0068,and an exceeding high and steep hill before it before i got to the top of the hill i thought my heart and legs and all would have broken and failed me what through faintness and soreness of body it was a grievous day of travel to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4363,4406-16883-0000,and the change that had come upon us we had husband and father and children and sisters and friends and relations and house and home and many comforts of this life but now we may say as job,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4364,4406-16883-0001,and he lighted upon that comfortable scripture i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4365,4406-16883-0002,even as the psalmist says to declare the works of the lord and his wonderful power in carrying us along preserving us in the wilderness while under the enemy's hand and returning of us in safety again and his goodness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4366,4406-16883-0003,in bringing to my hand so many comfortable and suitable scriptures in my distress but to return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4367,4406-16883-0004,and in the morning we must go over the river to philip's crew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4368,4406-16883-0005,which was the first time to my remembrance that i wept before them although i had met with so much affliction and my heart was many times ready to break yet could i not shed one tear in their sight but rather,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4369,4406-16883-0006,by the rivers of babylon there we sate down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4370,4406-16883-0007,then came one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me and another gave me half a pint of peas which was more worth than many bushels at another time then i went to see king philip he bade me come in and sit down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4371,4406-16883-0008,and asked me whether i would smoke it a usual compliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners but this no way suited me for though i had formerly used tobacco yet i had left it ever since i was first taken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4372,4406-16883-0009,it seems to be a bait the devil lays to make men lose their precious time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4373,4406-16883-0010,when i had taken two or three pipes i was presently ready for another such a bewitching thing it is but i thank god he has now given me power over it surely there are many who,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4374,4406-16883-0011,whereupon they fell to boiling of ground nuts and parching of corn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4375,4406-16883-0012,during my abode in this place philip spake to me to make a shirt for his boy which i did for which he gave me a shilling i offered the money to my master but he bade me keep it and with it i bought a piece of horse flesh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4376,4406-16883-0013,afterwards he asked me to make a cap for his boy for which he invited me to dinner i went and he gave me a pancake about as big as two fingers it was made of parched wheat beaten and fried in bear's grease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4377,4406-16883-0014,and bear together and invited my master and mistress to dinner but the proud gossip because i served them both in one dish would eat nothing except one bit that he gave her upon the point of his knife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4378,4406-16883-0015,hearing that my son was come to this place i went to see him and found him lying flat upon the ground i asked him how he could sleep so he answered me that he was not asleep but at prayer and lay so that they might not observe what he was doing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4379,4406-16883-0016,i pray god he may remember these things now he is returned in safety at this place the sun now getting higher what with the beams and heat of the sun and the smoke of the wigwams i thought i should have been blind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4380,4406-16883-0017,who owned that mary thurston came running after me and got it away again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4381,4406-16883-0018,i put it in my pocket to keep it safe yet notwithstanding somebody stole it but put five indian corns in the room of it which corns were the greatest provisions i had in my travel for one day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4382,4406-16883-0019,and sell me for powder for so they had sometimes discoursed i was utterly hopeless of getting home on foot the way that i came i could hardly bear to think of the many weary steps i had taken to come to this place the ninth remove,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4383,4406-16883-0020,but instead of going either to albany or homeward we must go five miles up the river and then go over it here we abode a while here lived a sorry indian who spoke to me to make him a shirt when i had done it he would pay me nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4384,4406-16883-0021,but he living by the riverside where i often went to fetch water i would often be putting of him in mind and calling for my pay at last he told me if i would make another shirt for a papoose not yet born he would give me a knife which he did when i had done it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4385,4406-16883-0022,and i was not a little glad that i had anything that they would accept of and be pleased with when we were at this place my master's maid came home she had been gone three weeks into the narragansett country to fetch corn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4386,4406-16883-0023,where they had stored up some in the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4387,4406-16883-0024,i turned homeward again and met with my master he showed me the way to my son when i came to him i found him not well and withall he had a boil on his side which much troubled him we bemoaned one another a while as the lord helped us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4388,4406-16883-0025,and then i returned again when i was returned i found myself as unsatisfied as i was before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4389,4406-16883-0026,my son was ill and i could not but think of his mournful looks and no christian friend was near him to do any office of love for him either for soul or body and my poor girl i knew not where she was nor whether she was sick or well or alive or dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4390,4406-16883-0027,i repaired under these thoughts to my bible my great comfort in that time and that scripture came to my hand cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee psalm fifty five,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4391,4406-16883-0028,for fear they would get it from me and there it lay all that day and night in my stinking pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4392,4406-16883-0029,but now that was savory to me that one would think was enough to turn the stomach of a brute creature one bitter cold day i could find no room to sit down before the fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4393,4406-16883-0030,and gave me some ground nuts and bade me come again and told me they would buy me if they were able and yet these were strangers to me that i never saw before the tenth remove,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4394,4406-16883-0031,and put it into my pocket and never let her see it afterward then they packed up their things to be gone and gave me my load i complained it was too heavy whereupon she gave me a slap in the face and bade me go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4395,4406-16883-0032,i lifted up my heart to god hoping the redemption was not far off and the rather because their insolency grew worse and worse but the thoughts of my going homeward for so we bent our course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4396,4406-16883-0033,much cheered my spirit and made my burden seem light and almost nothing at all but to my amazement and great perplexity the scale was soon turned for when we had gone a little way on a sudden my mistress gives out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4397,4406-16883-0034,and would have had him gone back also but he would not but said he would go on and come to us again in three days my spirit was upon this i confess very impatient and almost outrageous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4398,4406-16883-0035,be still and know that i am god psalm forty six,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4399,4406-16883-0036,which were some refreshment to me towards night i gathered some sticks for my own comfort that i might not lie a cold but when we came to lie down they bade me to go out and lie somewhere else for they had company they said come in more than their own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4400,4406-16883-0037,i told them i could not tell where to go they bade me go look i told them if i went to another wigwam they would be angry and send me home again then one of the company drew his sword and told me he would run me through if i did not go presently then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4401,4406-16883-0038,was i fain to stoop to this rude fellow and to go out in the night i knew not whither mine eyes have seen that fellow afterwards walking up and down boston under the appearance of a friend indian and several others of the like cut,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4402,4406-16883-0039,i went to one wigwam and they told me they had no room then i went to another and they said the same at last an old indian bade me to come to him and his squaw gave me some ground nuts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4403,4406-16883-0040,and a good fire we had and through the good providence of god i had a comfortable lodging that night in the morning another indian bade me come at night and he would give me six ground nuts which i did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4404,4406-16883-0041,we went in the morning to gather ground nuts to the river and went back again that night i went with a good load at my back for they when they went though but a little way would carry all their trumpery with them i told them the skin was off my back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4405,4406-16883-0042,but i had no other comforting answer from them than this that it would be no matter if my head were off too the thirteenth remove instead of going toward the bay which was that i desired,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4406,4406-16883-0043,where we abode almost a fortnight here one asked me to make a shirt for her papoose for which she gave me a mess of broth which was thickened with meal made of the bark of a tree and to make it the better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4407,4406-16883-0044,and a few roasted ground nuts i had not seen my son a pretty while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4408,4406-16883-0045,and asked him when he saw him he answered me that such a time his master roasted him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4409,4406-16883-0046,as big as his two fingers and that he was very good meat but the lord upheld my spirit under this discouragement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4410,4406-16883-0047,that makes the least conscience of speaking of truth in this place on a cold night as i lay by the fire i removed a stick that kept the heat from me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4411,4406-16883-0048,yet upon this and the like occasions i hope it is not too much to say with job,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4412,4406-16883-0049,but when i was without and saw nothing but wilderness and woods and a company of barbarous heathens my mind quickly returned to me which made me think of that spoken concerning sampson who said i will go out and shake myself as at other times,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4413,4406-16883-0050,but he wist not that the lord was departed from him about this time i began to think that all my hopes of restoration would come to nothing i thought of the english army and hoped for their coming and being taken by them but that failed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4414,4406-16883-0051,i hoped to be carried to albany as the indians had discoursed before but that failed also i thought of being sold to my husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4415,4406-16883-0052,as my master spake but instead of that my master himself was gone and i left behind so that my spirit was now quite ready to sink i asked them to let me go out and pick up some sticks that i might get alone and pour out my heart unto the lord,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4416,4406-16883-0053,they all gathered about the poor man asking him many questions i desired also to go and see him and when i came he was crying bitterly supposing they would quickly kill him whereupon i asked one of them whether they intended to kill him he answered me they would not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4417,4406-16883-0054,he being a little cheered with that i asked him about the welfare of my husband he told me he saw him such a time in the bay and he was well but very melancholy by which i certainly understood though i suspected it before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4418,4406-16883-0055,that whatsoever the indians told me respecting him was vanity and lies some of them told me he was dead and they had killed him some said he was married again and that the governor wished him to marry and told him he should have his choice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4419,4406-16883-0056,and that all persuaded i was dead so like were these barbarous creatures to him who was a liar from the beginning as i was sitting once in the wigwam here philip's maid came in with the child in her arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4420,4406-16883-0057,i told her i would tear her coat then with that my mistress rises up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4421,4406-16883-0058,were going to the french for powder but by the way the mohawks met with them and killed four of their company which made the rest turn back again for it might have been worse with him had he been sold to the french,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4422,4406-16883-0059,than it proved to be in his remaining with the indians i went to see an english youth in this place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4423,4406-16883-0060,he told me he was very sick of a flux with eating so much blood they had turned him out of the wigwam and with him an indian papoose almost dead whose parents had been killed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4424,2136-5140-0000,as already detailed that i was one night sitting at the great drawing room window lost in the melancholy reveries of night and in admiration of the moonlighted scene i was the only occupant of the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4425,2136-5140-0001,hardly reached to the window at which i sat the shorn grass sloped gently downward from the windows till it met the broad level on which stood in clumps or solitarily scattered some of the noblest timber in england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4426,2136-5140-0002,hoar in the moonbeams stood those graceful trees casting their moveless shadows upon the grass and in the background crowning the undulations of the distance in masses were piled those woods among which lay the solitary tomb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4427,2136-5140-0003,to me funereal but glorious woods which formed the background of the picture my thoughts recurred to my father's mysterious intimations and the image of the approaching visitor and the thought of the unknown journey saddened me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4428,2136-5140-0004,in all that concerned his religion from very early association there was to me something of the unearthly and spectral when my dear mamma died i was not nine years old and i remember two days before the funeral,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4429,2136-5140-0005,there came to knowl where she died a thin little man with large black eyes and a very grave dark face he was shut up a good deal with my dear father who was in deep affliction and missus rusk used to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4430,2136-5140-0006,and good mister clay ready at call in the village much good that little black whipper snapper will do him with that little black man on the day after the funeral i was sent out for some reason for a walk my governess was ill i know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4431,2136-5140-0007,and there was confusion in the house and i dare say the maids made as much of a holiday as they could i remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man but i was not afraid of him for he was gentle though sad and seemed kind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4432,2136-5140-0008,he led me into the garden the dutch garden we used to call it with a balustrade and statues at the farther front laid out in a carpet pattern of brilliantly coloured flowers we came down the broad flight of caen stone steps into this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4433,2136-5140-0009,and we walked in silence to the balustrade the base was too high at the spot where we reached it for me to see over but holding my hand he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4434,2136-5140-0010,well you can't but i can see beyond it shall i tell you what i see ever so much i see a cottage with a steep roof that looks like gold in the sunlight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4435,2136-5140-0011,growing by the walls and windows and two little children are playing among the stems of the trees and we are on our way there and in a few minutes shall be under those trees ourselves and talking to those little children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4436,2136-5140-0012,yet now to me it is but a picture in my brain and to you but a story told by me which you believe come dear let us be going so we descended the steps at the right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4437,2136-5140-0013,and there we stood in rich sunlight among the many objects he had described is this your house my little men he asked of the children pretty little rosy boys who assented and he leaned with his open hand against the stem of one of the trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4438,2136-5140-0014,the same on which i was now looking in the distance every now and then he made me sit down to rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4439,2136-5140-0015,would relate some little story reflecting even to my childish mind a strange suspicion of a spiritual meaning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4440,2136-5140-0016,and somehow startling in its very vagueness thus entertained though a little awfully i accompanied the dark mysterious little whipper snapper through the woodland glades,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4441,2136-5140-0017,we came to me quite unexpectedly in the deep sylvan shadows upon the grey pillared temple four fronted with a slanting pedestal of lichen stained steps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4442,2136-5140-0018,the lonely sepulchre in which i had the morning before seen poor mamma laid at the sight the fountains of my grief reopened and i cried bitterly repeating oh mamma mamma little mamma,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4443,2136-5140-0019,and so went on weeping and calling wildly on the deaf and the silent there was a stone bench some ten steps away from the tomb sit down beside me my child said the grave man with the black eyes very kindly and gently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4444,2136-5140-0020,now what do you see there he asked pointing horizontally with his stick towards the centre of the opposite structure oh that that place where poor mamma is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4445,2136-5140-0021,yes a stone wall with pillars too high for either you or me to see over but here he mentioned a name which i think must have been swedenborg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4446,2136-5140-0022,i only know that it sounded to me like the name of a magician in a fairy tale i fancied he lived in the wood which surrounded us and i began to grow frightened as he proceeded but swedenborg sees beyond it over and through it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4447,2136-5140-0023,and has told me all that concerns us to know he says your mamma is not there she is taken away i cried starting up and with streaming eyes gazing on the building which though i stamped my feet in my distraction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4448,2136-5140-0024,i was afraid to approach oh is mamma taken away where is she where have they brought her to i was uttering unconsciously very nearly the question with which mary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4449,2136-5140-0025,in the grey of that wondrous morning on which she stood by the empty sepulchre accosted the figure standing near your mamma is alive but too far away to see or hear us swedenborg standing here can see and hear her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4450,2136-5140-0026,and tells me all he sees just as i told you in the garden about the little boys and the cottage and the trees and flowers which you could not see,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4451,2136-5140-0027,so i can tell you now as i did then and as we are both i hope walking on to the same place just as we did to the trees and cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4452,2136-5140-0028,how true the description is which i give you i was very frightened for i feared that when he had done his narrative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4453,2136-5140-0029,and of shadows where the dead were visible he leaned his elbow on his knee and his forehead on his hand which shaded his downcast eyes in that attitude he described to me a beautiful landscape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4454,2136-5140-0030,radiant with a wondrous light in which rejoicing my mother moved along an airy path ascending among mountains of fantastic height and peaks melting in celestial colouring into the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4455,2136-5140-0031,he said the same words he had spoken before come dear let us go oh no no no not now i said resisting and very much frightened home i mean dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4456,2136-5140-0032,we cannot walk to the place i have described we can only reach it through the gate of death to which we are all tending young and old with sure steps and where is the gate of death i asked in a sort of whisper as we walked together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4457,2136-5140-0033,holding his hand and looking stealthily he smiled sadly and said when sooner or later the time comes as hagar's eyes were opened in the wilderness and she beheld the fountain of water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4458,2136-5140-0034,so shall each of us see the door open before us and enter in and be refreshed for a long time following this walk i was very nervous more so for the awful manner in which missus rusk received my statement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4459,2136-5140-0035,with stern lips and upturned hands and eyes and an angry expostulation i do wonder at you mary quince letting the child walk into the wood with that limb of darkness it is a mercy he did not show her the devil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4460,2136-5140-0036,or frighten her out of her senses in that lonely place of these swedenborgians indeed i know no more than i might learn from good missus rusk's very inaccurate talk two or three of them crossed in the course of my early life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4461,2136-5140-0037,but i grew after a day or two so nervous that i laid it aside it is enough for me to know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions which so far from superseding confirmed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4462,2136-5140-0038,and interpreted the language of the bible and as dear papa accepted their ideas i am happy in thinking that they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy writ leaning on my hand i was now looking upon that solemn wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4463,2136-5140-0039,white and shadowy in the moonlight where for a long time after that ramble with the visionary i fancied the gate of death hidden only by a strange glamour and the dazzling land of ghosts were situate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4464,2136-5140-0040,and i suppose these earlier associations gave to my reverie about my father's coming visitor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4465,2136-5143-0000,chapter six a walk in the wood two little pieces of by play in which i detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion from the corner of the gallery i one day saw her when she thought i was out and all quiet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4466,2136-5143-0001,with her ear at the keyhole of papa's study,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4467,2136-5143-0002,her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs from which only she apprehended surprise her great mouth was open and her eyes absolutely goggled with eagerness she was devouring all that was passing there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4468,2136-5143-0003,indignation however quickly returned and i came back treading briskly as i did so when i reached the angle of the gallery again madame i suppose had heard me for she was half way down the stairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4469,2136-5143-0004,i am so glad to find you and you are dress to come out we shall have so pleasant walk at that moment the door of my father's study opened and missus rusk with her dark energetic face very much flushed stepped out in high excitement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4470,2136-5143-0005,the master says you may have the brandy bottle madame and i'm glad to be rid of it i am madame courtesied with a great smirk that was full of intangible hate and insult better your own brandy if drink you must exclaimed missus rusk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4471,2136-5143-0006,you may come to the store room now or the butler can take it and off whisked missus rusk for the back staircase there had been no common skirmish on this occasion but a pitched battle madame had made a sort of pet of anne wixted an underchambermaid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4472,2136-5143-0007,with a brandy bottle under her apron stealing up stairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4473,2136-5143-0008,madame had commissioned her to buy it in the town and convey it to her bed room upon this missus rusk impounded the flask and with anne beside her rather precipitately appeared before the master he heard and summoned madame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4474,2136-5143-0009,madame was cool frank and fluent the brandy was purely medicinal she produced a document in the form of a note doctor somebody presented his compliments to madame de la rougierre and ordered her a table spoonful of brandy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4475,2136-5143-0010,and some drops of laudanum whenever the pain of stomach returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4476,2136-5143-0011,she claimed her medicine man's estimate of woman is higher than woman's own perhaps in their relations to men they are generally more trustworthy perhaps woman's is the juster and the other an appointed illusion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4477,2136-5143-0012,i don't know but so it is ordained missus rusk was recalled and i saw as you are aware madame's procedure during the interview it was a great battle a great victory madame was in high spirits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4478,2136-5143-0013,the air was sweet the landscape charming i so good everything so beautiful where should we go this way i had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to madame i was so incensed at the treachery i had witnessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4479,2136-5143-0014,but such resolutions do not last long with very young people and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood we were talking pretty much as usual i don't wish to go into the wood madame and for what poor mamma is buried there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4509,2136-5143-0044,this did not last very long however and she soon resumed her wonted ways and she returned to the question of the will but not so directly and with more art,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4512,2136-5147-0002,but she is ill i answered and all this time i was ready to cry for vexation thinking of my dress which must be very absurd to elicit so much unaffected laughter from my experienced relative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4514,2136-5147-0004,but she may also be about the most pernicious inmate imaginable she may teach you a bad accent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4515,2136-5147-0005,and heaven knows what beside send the housekeeper my dear to tell her that i am going to see her i had better go myself perhaps i said fearing a collision between missus rusk and the bitter frenchwoman very well dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4516,2136-5147-0006,not sorry somehow to escape before captain oakley returned as i went along the passage i was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it and trying in vain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4517,2136-5147-0007,to recollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of that beautiful and garrulous dandy i could not quite the reverse indeed still i was uncomfortable and feverish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4518,2136-5147-0008,girls of my then age will easily conceive how miserable under similar circumstances such a misgiving would make them it was a long way to madame's room i met missus rusk bustling along the passage with a housemaid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4519,2136-5147-0009,how is madame i asked quite well i believe answered the housekeeper drily nothing the matter that i know of she eat enough for two to day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4520,2136-5147-0010,i try to swallow a little to please her and your cold is it better she shook her head languidly her elbow resting on the chair and three finger tips supporting her forehead and then she made a little sigh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4521,2136-5147-0011,looking down from the corners of her eyes in an interesting dejection,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4522,2136-5147-0012,but i am quaite appy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4523,2136-5147-0013,and with these words she turned a languid glance of gratitude on me which dropped on the ground lady knollys wishes very much to see you only for a few minutes if you could admit her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4524,2136-5147-0014,vous savez les malades see never visitors she replied with a startled sort of tartness and a momentary energy besides i cannot converse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4525,2136-5147-0015,of head and of the ear the right ear it is parfois agony absolutely and now it is here and she winced and moaned with her eyes closed and her hand pressed to the organ affected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4526,2136-5147-0016,simple as i was i felt instinctively that madame was shamming she was over acting her transitions were too violent and beside she forgot that i knew how well she could speak english and must perceive that she was heightening the interest of her helplessness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4527,2136-5147-0017,by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom i there fore said with a kind of courage which sometimes helped me suddenly oh madame don't you really think you might without much inconvenience see lady knollys for a very few minutes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4528,2136-5147-0018,but it is impossible you must see quite impossible i never you know refuse to take trouble when i am able never never and madame shed some tears which always came at call,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4529,2136-5147-0019,and with her hand pressed to her ear said very faintly be so good to tell your friend how you see me and how i suffer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4530,2136-5147-0020,since the pain will not allow me to remain longer so with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4531,2136-5147-0021,i returned to the drawing room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4532,2136-5147-0022,has gone to the billiard room i think,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4533,2136-5147-0023,that then accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which i had heard as i passed the door i have been telling maud how detestably she is got up very thoughtful of you monica said my father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4534,2136-5147-0024,yes and really austin it is quite clear you ought to marry you want some one to take this girl out and look after her and who's to do it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4535,2136-5147-0025,and it is really such a pity for she's a very pretty creature and a clever woman could make her quite charming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4536,2136-5147-0026,eight and twenty years ago or more with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds well you know she has got ever so much now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4537,2136-5147-0027,and though you would not have her then she has had her second husband since i can tell you i'm glad i was not the first said my father well they really say her wealth is absolutely immense her last husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4538,2136-5147-0028,the russian merchant left her everything she has not a human relation and she is in the best set you were always a match maker monica said my father stopping and putting his hand kindly on hers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4539,2136-5147-0029,but it won't do no no monica we must take care of little maud some other way i was relieved we women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4540,2136-5147-0030,and think that no widower is quite above or below that danger and i remember whenever my father which indeed was but seldom made a visit to town or anywhere else it was a saying of missus rusk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4541,2136-5147-0031,i shan't wonder neither need you my dear if he brings home a young wife with him so my father with a kind look at her and a very tender one on me went silently to the library as he often did about that hour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4542,2136-5147-0032,i suppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at knowl and thought it no harm to excite my vigilance but it was impossible long to be vexed with cousin monica,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4543,2136-5147-0033,you know my dear your father is an oddity she said i don't mind him i never did you must not cracky my dear cracky decidedly cracky and she tapped the corner of her forehead with a look so sly and comical,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4612,5652-19215-0061,one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people since they did not need it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4614,5652-39938-0000,the psychological work of the physician does not begin with his curative efforts therapy is always only the last step diagnosis and observation have to precede and an inquiry into the causes of the disease is essential,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4615,5652-39938-0001,the whole equipment of the modern laboratory ought to be put at its disposal perceptions and associations reactions and expressions ought to be examined with the same carefulness with which the conscientious physician examines the blood and the urine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4616,5652-39938-0002,and yet no psychical treatment can start successfully so long as the patient is brooding on secret thoughts at the bottom of his mind the desire to hide them may often be itself a part of the disease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4617,5652-39938-0003,it is surprising how often unsuspected vistas of thoughts and impulses and emotions are opened by an inquiring analysis where the direct report of the patient does not awaken the least suspicion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4618,5652-39938-0004,the intellectual clearness of the patient too easily tempts one into trusting the sincerity of his story and yet the most important ideas clustering perhaps about love or ambition about vice or crime about business failure or family secrets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4619,5652-39938-0005,withheld and may frustrate every psychotherapeutic influence where suspicion is awake and mere confidential talk and persuasion seem insufficient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4620,5652-39938-0006,the physician may feel justified in the interest of his patient in drawing the thoughts out of their hiding place by artificial means skill tact and experience are needed there as a matter of course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4621,5652-39938-0007,will support the physician and accordingly his examination is not obliged to trap the patient but simply to guide him to important points but then begins the most essential study of diagnostical differentiation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4622,5652-39938-0008,with all the means not only of psychology but of neurology and internal medicine he has to separate the particular case from similar ones and to examine whether he deals with for instance a hysteric or with a paranoiac,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4623,5652-39938-0009,and he will not forget that there exist almost no symptoms of serious diseases which the nervous system of the hysteric may not imitate for a time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4624,5652-39938-0010,not ours is the task of analyzing special methods of neurological and mental differential diagnosis such as are used in the psychiatric clinic and in the office of the nerve specialist there the family history with reference to nervous and other diseases,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4625,5652-39938-0011,in a similar way the psychical examination tests the hallucinations and illusions the variations and defects of memory and attention of judgment and reasoning of orientation and self consciousness of emotions and volitions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4626,5652-39938-0012,but one rule is common to all of them never use psychotherapeutic methods in a schematic way like a rigid pattern schematic treatment is a poor treatment in every department of medicine but in psychotherapeutics it is disastrous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4627,5652-39938-0013,there are no two cases alike and not only the easily recognizable differences of sex and age and occupation and education and financial means and temperament and capacity are decisive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4628,5652-39938-0014,but all the subtle variations of prejudices and beliefs preferences and dislikes family life and social surroundings ambitions and prospects memories and fancies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4629,5652-39938-0015,every element of a man's life history impressions of early childhood his love and his successes his diseases and his distresses his acquaintances and his reading his talent his character his sincerity his energy his intelligence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4630,5652-39938-0016,everything ought to determine the choice of the psychotherapeutic steps as it is entirely impossible to determine all those factors by any sufficient inquiry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4631,5652-39938-0017,most of the adjustment of method must be left to the instinct of the physician in which wide experience solid knowledge tact and sympathy ought to be blended even the way in which the patient reacts on the method will often guide the instinct of the well trained psychotherapist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4632,5652-39938-0018,it is therefore certainly not enough that the knowledge of the physician simply decide beforehand on a definite course of psychical treatment and leave the carrying out to a well meaning minister or any other medical amateur who schematically follows the indicated path,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4633,5652-39938-0019,the finest adjustment has to come in during the treatment itself and the response of the patient often has to suggest entirely new lines of procedure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4634,5652-39938-0020,more than in any other field of medicine the physician himself has to extend his influence far beyond the office hours and the strictly medical relations and yet on the other hand there is no department of medicine in which the treatment might not profit by the psychotherapeutic influence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4635,5652-39938-0021,subtle adjustment to the personal needs and to the individual conditions is necessary in every case where the psychical factor is to play an important role,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4636,5652-39938-0022,it cannot be denied that the one great obstacle in the work of the routine physician is the lack of time and patience which is needed for successful treatment to prescribe drugs is always quicker than to influence the mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4637,5652-39938-0023,the first method to bring back the psychophysical equilibrium,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4638,5652-39938-0024,namely to remove the external sources of the disturbance external indicates there not only the outer world but also the own body outside the conscious parts of the brain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4639,5652-39938-0025,if we take it in the widest meaning this would evidently include every possible medical task from filling a painful tooth to operating on a painful appendix as in every case where pain results the mental equilibrium is disturbed by it and the normal mental life of the patient reduced in its efficiency,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4640,5652-39938-0026,growths in the nose may be operated upon the astigmatic or the short sighted eye may be corrected by glasses the child who is hard of hearing may at least be seated near the teacher and the backward children quickly reach the average level,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4641,5652-39938-0027,no doubt in the life of the adult as well often almost insignificant and from a strictly physical point of view unimportant abnormities in the bodily system,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4642,5652-39938-0028,especially in the digestive and sexual spheres are sources of irritation which slowly influence the whole personality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4643,5652-39938-0029,to be sure the brain disturbance may have reached a point where the mere removal of the original affliction is not sufficient to reinstate the normal balance of mental energies but wherever such a bodily irritation goes on it is never too late to abolish it in the interests of psychotherapy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4644,5652-39938-0030,however often he may get the impression that such a liberation would stop the source of the mental trouble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4645,5652-39938-0031,often within a surprisingly short time the brain gathers the energies to overcome the frictions with unavoidable surroundings yet here the physician has to adjust the prescribed dose of outing very carefully to the special case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4646,5652-39938-0032,we may be guided by the psychological experiments which have been made in the interest of testing the fatigue induced by mental work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4647,5652-39938-0033,if perhaps four hours of concentrated work are done without pauses experiment shows that the quality of the work deteriorates measured for instance by the number of mistakes in quick calculation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4648,5652-39938-0034,the instinct of the physician has to find the middle way between a temporary removal of irritation which really allows a development of new energies and a mere interruption which simply damages the acquired relative adjustment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4649,5652-39938-0035,every cause of friction which can be permanently annihilated for the patient certainly should be removed this negative remedy demands its positive supplement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4650,5652-39938-0036,the patient must be brought under conditions and influences which give fair chances for the recuperation of his energies too often from the standpoint of the psychologist the prescription is simply rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4651,5652-39938-0037,as far as rest involves sleep it is certainly the ideal prescription there is no other influence which builds up the injured central nervous system as safely as sound natural sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4652,5652-39938-0038,and loss of sleep is certainly one of the most pernicious conditions for the brain again rest is a great factor in those systematic rest cures which for a long while were almost the fashion with the neurologist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4653,5652-39938-0039,it is simply meant that he give up his fatiguing daily work even if that work is made up of a round of entertainments and calls and social engagements the neurasthenic and all similar varieties are sent away from the noise of the city away from the rush of their busy life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4654,5652-39938-0040,the wild chase for luxury in the higher classes reenforced by the commercialism of our time the hard and monotonous labor in our modern mills and mines for the lower classes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4655,5652-39938-0041,the over excitement brought to everybody by the sensationalism of our newspapers and of our public life all injure the brain cells and damage the equilibrium,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4656,5652-39938-0042,that is a story which we hear a thousand times nowadays yet it is doubtful whether there is really much truth in such a claim and whether much wise psychotherapy can be deduced from it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4657,5652-39938-0043,we may begin even with the very justifiable doubt whether nervousness really has increased in our time earlier periods had not so many names for those symptoms and were not able to discriminate them with the same clearness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4658,5652-39938-0044,even today most people are still without suspicion that a neurasthenic or a psychasthenic or a hysteric disturbance of the nervous system may be in its beginning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4659,5652-39938-0045,earlier times surely may have treated even the stronger varieties of this kind as troublesome variations in the sphere of the normal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4660,5652-39938-0046,the progress of scientific hygiene has brought everyone much nearer to a harmonious functioning of the organism and the progress of technique has removed innumerable difficulties from the play of life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4661,5652-39938-0047,of course we stand today before a much more complex surrounding than our ancestors but still more quickly than the complexity have grown the means to master it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4662,5652-39938-0048,there is no nation on earth which is more proud of its rush and its hurry than the american people and yet what an,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4663,5652-39938-0049,moreover our life has probably become cooler there is less emotionalism less sentimentality more business like attitude and that all means less inner friction and excitement in public life too less fear of war and less religious struggle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4664,5652-39938-0050,above all the intensity of mental stimuli is always relative the psychologist knows the experiments which determine that we perceive the difference of impressions as alike when the stimuli are proportional,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4666,5652-39938-0052,yet that quiet countryman may react in his narrow system not less when the modest changes in his surroundings provoke him the gossip of his neighbor may undermine his nervous system just as much as a political fight or the struggles of the exchange that of the city man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4667,5652-39938-0053,every effort should be estimated with reference to the standard of the particular case this relativity of the mental reaction on the demands of life must always be in the foreground of the psychotherapeutic regime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4669,5652-39938-0055,complete rest for instance for a hard brain worker hardly ought to be recommended unless a high degree of exhaustion has come on if routine prescriptions are to be admitted at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4670,5652-39938-0056,they should not be complete rest or complete change of life for any length of time but a continuation of the life for which adjustment has been learned with a reasonable reduction of the demands and stimulations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4671,5652-39938-0057,the intellectual worker ought to decrease his work the overbusy society woman ought to stay in bed one day in the week the man in the midst of the rush of life ought to cut down his obligations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4672,5652-39938-0058,but probably each of them does better to go on than simply to swear off altogether their rest ought to have the character of vacation that means interruptions without the usual activity ought to be short periods spent with the distinct feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4673,5652-39938-0059,that they are interruptions of that which must last and that they are not themselves to become lasting states,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4674,5652-39938-0060,strenuosity must not mean an external rush with the gestures of overbusy excitement but certainly the doctrine of the lazy life is wretched psychotherapy as long as no serious illness is in question,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4675,5652-39938-0061,by far the best alteration is therefore even in the periods of interruption not simply rest but new engagements which awaken new interests and stimulate neglected mental factors disburdening the over strained elements of mental life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4676,5652-39938-0062,the most effective agency for this task is contact with beauty beauty in nature and life beauty in art and literature and music,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4677,5652-39938-0063,to enjoy a landscape ought to be not merely a negative rest for the man of the office building and good literature or music absorbs the mental energies and harmonizes them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4678,5652-39938-0064,in the second place come games and sport which may enter into their right if fatigue can be avoided harmonious joyful company as different as possible from the depressing company of the sanitariums will add its pleasantness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4679,5652-39938-0065,while the advice of the physician ought thus to emphasize the positive elements which work not towards rest but toward a harmonious mental activity we must not forget some essential negative prescriptions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4680,5652-39938-0066,everything is to be avoided which interferes with the night's sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4681,211-122442-0000,he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4682,211-122442-0001,whom he had sent home two hours before from the hotel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him the reader may ask,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4683,211-122442-0002,when he was left stiff as a rush in london in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses has anyone brought a letter for me asked d'artagnan eagerly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4684,211-122442-0003,but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4685,211-122442-0004,i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4686,211-122442-0005,it is not natural for letters to enter people's houses in this manner if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but no all was hermetically sealed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4687,211-122442-0006,there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4688,211-122442-0007,there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you be this evening about ten o'clock at saint cloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4689,211-122442-0008,while reading this letter d'artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4690,211-122442-0009,his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4691,211-122442-0010,did i not guess truly is it not some bad affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4692,211-122442-0011,exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4693,211-122442-0012,my dear planchet i am the happiest of men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4694,211-122442-0013,which the liberality of d'artagnan had not entirely effaced left alone d'artagnan read and reread his billet then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4695,211-122442-0014,at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4696,211-122442-0015,i am going out for all day perhaps you are therefore your own master till seven o'clock in the evening but at seven o'clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4697,211-122442-0016,we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways you will take your musketoon and your pistols,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4698,211-122442-0017,ah like the charming journey the other day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4699,211-122442-0018,i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4701,211-122442-0020,perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said d'artagnan and nodding to planchet he went out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4702,211-122442-0021,d'artagnan's intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4703,211-122442-0022,besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at saint cloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4704,211-122442-0023,the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4705,211-122442-0024,whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal's executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4706,211-122442-0025,d'artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4707,211-122442-0026,in a tine of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4709,211-122442-0028,far from here oh lord no about forty leagues only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4710,211-122442-0029,where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4711,211-122442-0030,as i see there is no concealing anything from you yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4712,211-122442-0031,and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4713,211-122442-0032,so trifling indeed that d'artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man ah may you be a true prophet said d'artagnan laughing no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4714,211-122442-0033,is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked d'artagnan do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4716,211-122442-0035,that d'artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4718,211-122442-0037,this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4719,211-122442-0038,so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend amuse yourself well replied bonacieux,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4720,211-122442-0039,he certainly would not have remarked it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4721,211-122442-0040,his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative he found treville in a joyful mood he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4722,211-122442-0041,he had retired at one o'clock under the pretense of being indisposed as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six o'clock in the morning now said treville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4724,211-122442-0043,the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied d'artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4725,211-122442-0044,the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4757,211-122442-0076,as he passed the hotel des gardes he took a glance in to the stables three of the four horses had already arrived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4760,211-122442-0079,but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4761,211-122442-0080,two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4762,211-122442-0081,and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4763,211-122442-0082,shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4764,211-122442-0083,heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4765,211-122425-0000,do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4766,211-122425-0001,ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged no sire replied treville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4767,211-122425-0002,i'll be their warranty and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty's service but what are they to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4768,211-122425-0003,would not one say he was speaking of a religious community in truth my dear captain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4769,211-122425-0004,and by and by by and by we will see ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4770,211-122425-0005,the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4771,211-122425-0006,la vieuville said he take my place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4772,211-122425-0007,ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of justice before everything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4773,211-122425-0008,yes sire as they always do and how did the thing happen let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4774,211-122425-0009,and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4775,211-122425-0010,had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning the party was to take place at saint germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4776,211-122425-0011,who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah you incline me to think so said the king there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4777,211-122425-0012,but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4778,211-122425-0013,then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty cannot be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4779,211-122425-0014,are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes treville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4780,211-122425-0015,but i will not swear to it sire you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4781,211-122425-0016,you are right treville but they were not alone your musketeers they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the king's musketeers one of whom was wounded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4782,211-122425-0017,and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal's guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4783,211-122425-0018,one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself d'artagnan sire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4784,211-122425-0019,he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well tell me how treville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4785,211-122425-0020,placing his hand upon his hip sire resumed treville as i told you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4786,211-122425-0021,he was dressed as a citizen the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see treville interrupted the king it was they who attacked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4787,211-122425-0022,that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4788,211-122425-0023,brave young man murmured the king well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4789,211-122425-0024,he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4790,211-122425-0025,it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom well sire for once he found his master i will see this young man treville i will see him and if anything can be done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4791,211-122425-0026,it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand treville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel it is a brawl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4792,211-122425-0027,that is true said the king but never mind treville come still by the back staircase treville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4793,211-122425-0028,he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4794,211-122425-0029,but d'artagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4795,211-122425-0030,d'artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4796,211-122425-0031,and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o'clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve the two musketeers were already there and were playing together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4797,211-122425-0032,although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4798,211-122425-0033,and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4799,211-122425-0034,passed so close to d'artagnan's face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4800,211-122425-0035,his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4801,211-122425-0036,declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4802,211-122425-0037,look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4803,211-122425-0038,you're in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing what is your name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4804,211-122425-0039,lest it be observed that we go out together you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way that's true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4805,211-122425-0040,that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4806,211-122425-0041,which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4807,211-122425-0042,never mind be content i will do my best on guard but said he whom d'artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4808,211-122425-0043,bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4809,211-122425-0044,he hoped to intimidate but d'artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4810,211-122425-0045,and as d'artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d'artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4811,211-122425-0046,in whose service he had a relative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4812,211-122425-0047,and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d'artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4813,211-122425-0048,and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4814,211-122425-0049,at these cries all who were in the hotel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4815,211-122425-0050,to his eminence thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king's musketeers in these quarrels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4816,211-122425-0051,to the rescue musketeers to the rescue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4817,211-122425-0052,who hastened to the succor of their comrades the melee became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4818,211-122425-0053,the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4819,211-122425-0054,excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hotel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4820,211-122425-0055,domestics in daring to make a sortie upon the king's musketeers the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o'clock struck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4821,211-122425-0056,they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong they soon tired of the sport besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4822,211-122425-0057,who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4823,211-122425-0058,and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4824,211-122425-0059,and the two will pass off together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4825,211-122425-0060,directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of saint germain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4826,211-122425-0061,required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4827,211-122425-0062,the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4828,211-122425-0063,gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4829,211-122425-0064,everyone to return home and wait for news,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4830,211-122425-0065,with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal's guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king's musketeers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4831,211-122425-0066,whose relative as we already know bernajoux was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4832,211-122425-0067,but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had endeavored to burn now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4833,211-122425-0068,he repaired therefore immediately to his hotel and caused himself to be announced the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem both were men of courage and honor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4834,211-122425-0069,we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4835,211-122425-0070,and all the fault is with your musketeers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4836,211-122425-0071,not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4837,211-122425-0072,in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4838,211-122425-0073,of which the doctor says bad things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4839,211-122425-0074,perfectly does he talk with difficulty but he can speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4840,211-122425-0075,let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4841,211-122425-0076,then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4842,211-122425-0077,placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4843,211-122425-0078,returned to his hotel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4844,211-122425-0079,that his eminence's guardsmen had received,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4845,211-122425-0080,not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4846,211-122425-0081,his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4847,3235-11599-0000,chapter ten measure ninety seven from the standpoint of the eye a measure is that portion of the staff found between two bars in certain cases this space may be less than a measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4848,3235-11599-0001,as e g at the beginning and end of a movement but from the standpoint of the ear a single isolated measure is not possible and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4849,3235-11599-0002,measures are similarly accented groups of evenly spaced beats each group having at least one accented and one non accented beat the strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4850,3235-11599-0003,two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical measure one a group of even beats or pulses always felt though not always actually sounded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4851,3235-11599-0004,one or more of these beats being stronger than the rest two certain rhythmic figures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4852,3235-11599-0005,cetera which form the actual musical content of these groups the student will note the essential difference between rhythm and measure rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a series of beats or pulses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4853,3235-11599-0006,while measure is the grouping of these beats according to some specified system in listening to a piece of music two hearers a and b may feel the rhythm equally strongly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4854,3235-11599-0007,but a may subjectively group the beats into one two one two et cetera while b feels the groups as one two three four one two three four et cetera,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4855,3235-11599-0008,rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing inherent in the music itself while measure is to a certain extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have adopted for practical purposes ninety eight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4856,3235-11599-0009,in syncopation the normal system of accenting is temporarily suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part of the measure syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4857,3235-11599-0010,and compound a simple measure is one which has but a single accent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4858,3235-11599-0011,two beat measure and three beat measure a compound measure is as its name implies one made up by combining two or more simple measures or by the elaboration of a single measure in slow tempo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4859,3235-11599-0012,into several constituent groups the principal compound measures are four beat and six beat both being referred to as compound duple measures five beat seven beat nine beat and twelve beat measures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4860,3235-11599-0013,are also classified as compound measures an english writer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4861,3235-11599-0014,classifies measures as duple triple or quadruple specifying that a simple measure is one in which each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided into halves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4862,3235-11599-0015,and that a compound measure is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted note whose value can be divided into three parts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4863,3235-11599-0016,there is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words simple and compound when applied in this connection the principal question at issue being whether four beat measure is an individual variety,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4864,3235-11599-0017,or whether it is a variety compounded out of two beat measures either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats as is often necessary in slow tempi,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4865,3235-11599-0018,perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4866,3235-11599-0019,in which there are three beats the first one being accented the second and third unaccented,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4867,3235-11599-0020,three eighth three quarter and three half measure respectively three quadruple in which there are four beats the first and third being accented primary accent on one secondary accent on three,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4869,3235-11599-0022,four sextuple in which there are six beats the first and fourth being accented the others not in rapid tempi this is always taken as compound duple measure a dotted quarter note having a beat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4870,3235-11599-0023,it will be noted that the two measures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4871,3235-11599-0024,but these are practically always taken as three beat and four beat measures respectively being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4872,3235-11599-0025,quintuple five beat and septuple seven beat measures are occasionally met with but these are rare and will always be sporadic the five beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4873,3235-11599-0026,or of two and three sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition while the seven beat measure is taken in groups of four and three or of three and four,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4874,3235-11599-0027,but usage varies somewhat and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four half measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4875,3235-11599-0028,but an incomplete circle differentiating two beat imperfect measure from three beat perfect measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4880,3235-28433-0004,our steamer was the good ship saint paul belonging to the alaska commercial company and was advertised to sail on may twenty fifth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4881,3235-28433-0005,when i laughingly called the attention of one of the owners of the ship to the fact that that date fell upon friday and many persons objected to sailing upon that day he postponed the starting of the saint paul to may twenty sixth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4882,3235-28433-0006,and we left the dock on saturday afternoon amid the cheers and hand waving of thousands of people who had come to see the big boat off for nome the steamer was well fitted out spick and span in fresh carpets and paint,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4883,3235-28433-0007,and crowded to the utmost capacity for comfort every stateroom was full each seat at the tables occupied not a foot of space above or below decks was left unused but provision was made for all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4884,3235-28433-0008,and the ship was well manned i was now much gratified to learn that there were many on board whom i had met before that the steward stewardess and several of the waiters had been on duty on the steamer bertha,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4887,3235-28433-0011,whom i had seen at saint michael some months before and who was now going back to her northern home she wore a sailor suit of navy blue serge trimmed with white braid and was as coy and cunning as ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4888,3235-28433-0012,not speaking often to strangers but laughing and running away to her mother when addressed from the day we sailed from san francisco until we reached nome i missed no meals in the dining salon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4889,3235-28433-0013,a pace which my english friends and others could not follow for they were uncomfortably ill in the region of their digestive apparatus for several days i slept for hours each day and thoroughly enjoyed the trip,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4890,3235-28433-0014,during the nine days sail from san francisco to unalaska a distance of two thousand three hundred and sixty eight miles i studied well the passengers we had preachers on board,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4891,3235-28433-0015,as well as doctors lawyers merchants and miners and there were women going to nome to start eating houses hotels and mercantile shops there were several swedish missionaries,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4892,3235-28433-0016,one a zealous young woman from san francisco going to the swedish mission at golovin bay this young person was pretty and pleasant and i was glad to make her acquaintance as well as that of three other women speaking the same tongue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4893,3235-28433-0017,and occupying the next stateroom to mine the last named were going to start a restaurant in nome as they were sociable jolly and good sailors for the most part i enjoyed their society they had all lived in san francisco for years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4894,3235-28433-0018,and though not related to each other were firm friends of long standing and were uniting their little fortunes in the hope of making greater ones the young missionary was a friend to the other three,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4895,3235-28433-0019,and i found no better or more congenial companions on board the ship than these four honest hard working women so full of hope courage and good sense as well as christianity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4896,3235-28433-0020,little did i then think that these people placed by a seeming chance in an adjoining stateroom were to be my fellow workers and true friends not only for the coming months in that arctic land to which we were going but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4897,3235-28433-0021,as the sequel will show perhaps for years to come not many days had passed when we found that we had on board what few steamers can boast of and that was an orchestra of professional musicians among the waiters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4898,3235-28433-0022,these were men going with all the others to seek their fortunes in the new gold fields working their passage as waiters on the ship to nome where they intended to leave it three evenings in the week these musicians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4899,3235-28433-0023,with the help of several singers on board gave concerts in the dining salon which though impromptu were very enjoyable a sweet and trained singer was the english girl of our company,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4900,3235-28433-0024,and she sang many times accompanied by the stringed instruments of the musicians much to the delight of the assembled passengers when she sang one evening in her clear sympathetic voice the selection,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4901,3235-28433-0025,oh where is my wandering boy tonight there was not a dry eye in the room and the mind of many a man went back to his old home and praying mother in some far distant state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4902,3235-28433-0026,making him resolve to write oftener to her that she might be comforted with a knowledge of his whereabouts and welfare these evenings were sometimes varied by recitations from an elocutionist on board,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4903,3235-28433-0027,and a practised clog dancer excited the risibles of the company to the extent that they usually shouted with laughter at his exhibition of flying heels day after day passed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4904,3235-28433-0028,those who were continually seasick had diversion enough it was useless for us to tell them a pathetic tale of some one who at some time had been more ill than they because they would not believe a word of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4905,3235-28433-0029,and it was equally useless to recommend an antidote for mal de mer such as theirs no one was ever so ill before they said they knew they should die and be buried at sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4906,3235-28433-0030,and hoped they would if that would put an end to their sufferings we tried at last to give them comfort by recommending out of former experiences ship's biscuit dry toast and pop corn as remedies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4907,3235-28433-0031,but only received black looks as our reward we then concluded that a diet of tea coffee and soup was exactly such a one as the fishes would recommend could they speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4908,3235-28433-0032,these favorite and much used liquids keeping up a continual swishing in one's interior regions and causing one to truthfully speak of the same as infernal instead of internal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4909,3235-28433-0033,but they were all tree physical as well as free moral agents and decided these things for themselves at last we entered the japan current and the weather was warmer and more enjoyable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4910,3235-28433-0034,on monday june fourth we saw from the deck a few drifting logs and a quantity of seaweed and these with the presence of gulls and goonies flying overhead convinced us that we were nearing land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4911,3235-28433-0035,we were not mistaken after eating an excellent six o'clock dinner we went above to find ourselves between high rocky cliffs which loomed up into mountains not far distant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4912,3235-28433-0036,and we knew we were again at the aleutian islands and in the rough waters of unimak pass as we drew nearer and entered the harbor so well land locked the sun dipped low into yellow red western waters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4913,3235-28433-0037,thereby casting long shadows aslant our pathway so delicately shaded in greens the little hamlet of dutch harbor nestled cosily at the foot of the mountains which bordered the bay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4914,3235-28433-0038,and here numbers of ships lay anchored at rest passing along easily beyond another high mountain we were soon at the dock of unalaska beside other great ships in port,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4915,3235-28433-0039,both groups of craft were evidently waiting for the ice to clear from behring sea before proceeding on their way northward and we counted sixteen ships of different kinds and sizes the majority of them large steamers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4916,3235-28433-0040,all were loaded with passengers and freight for nome scout boats had already been sent out to investigate and find if possible a passage through the ice fields,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4917,3235-28433-0041,and the return of these scouts with good news was anxiously watched and waited for as the most desired thing at that time was a speedy and safe landing on the supposedly golden beach sands of nome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4918,3235-28433-0042,at unalaska we spent four days taking on fresh water and coal during which time passengers visited back and forth from the waiting steamers many persons having friends on other boats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4919,3235-28433-0043,and each having a curiosity to see if they were faring as well or ill as he comparing notes as to the expense of traveling with the different companies et cetera passengers on the saint paul agreed that they had no kick comin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4920,3235-28433-0044,which was one of the commonest slang phrases intended to mean that they had no fault to find with the alaska commercial company and their steamer saint paul all were well cared for and satisfied as well they might be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4921,3235-28433-0045,with the service of the ship's men leaving unalaska the sun shone clear and cold upon the mountains where in places the sides looked black from the late fires started in the deep tundra by miscreants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4922,3235-28433-0046,the tops of the mountains were covered with snow down deep gorges dashed mountain waters of melting snow and ice hurrying to leap off gullied and rocky cliffs into the sea their progress was never impeded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4923,3235-28433-0047,no tree nor shrub obstructed the way with gnarled old trunks twisted roots or low hanging branches for none grow in unalaska,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4924,3235-28433-0048,and the bold dignity and grandeur of the mountains is never diminished by these lesser objects as our ship sailed out into behring sea we were closely followed by the steamer george w elder whose master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4925,3235-28433-0049,an old friend of our captain had decided to follow in our wake he being less familiar than the latter with alaskan waters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4926,3235-28452-0000,on the morning of the twenty sixth of june i awoke to find that the ice had drifted out to sea in the night eight days after mollie and i had taken our twelve miles trip across the bay and return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4927,3235-28452-0001,then came hard rain and wind that for several days blew the ice back into the bay first to one side and then to the other so that the steamers waiting to come in could not do so for fear of the drifting floes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4931,3235-28452-0005,sleeping during the day and guarding the house nights the heavy iron bracelets in his inner coat pocket weighing scarcely more than the loaded revolver in his belt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4932,3235-28452-0006,our little sick girl being obliged now to keep her bed continually with no more playing in the sand and sunshine although her cough had left her was still the same sweet patient child she had been through all her illness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4949,3235-28452-0023,and she is surely about to fulfill it born as she was in a rough mining camp at the foot of the barren hills she was given the eskimo name of yahkuk meaning a little hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4950,3235-28452-0024,and she like an oasis in a desert place is left here to cheer love and help others many times i have seen evidence of the sweet and gentle influences going out from the life of little yahkuk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4952,3235-28452-0026,then her big black eyes glance brightly into blue ones looking down from above full red lips part in a cordial smile while the one solitary dimple in the smooth round cheek,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4953,3235-28452-0027,pricks its way still deeper and small arms go up around his neck when the man turns his face wears a soft and tender expression as though he were looking at some beautiful sight far away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4954,3235-28452-0028,and perhaps he is god grant that the sweet memory of that little child's kiss may be so lasting that all their lives he and others may be purer and better men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4956,3235-28452-0030,to my good missionary friends i had already said good bye and the captain and mollie were kindly regretful with tears in my eyes but with real pain in my heart i bade jennie good bye,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4957,3235-28452-0031,and stepped into the little boat which was to carry me to the dora farewell then to chinik the home of the north wind and blizzard farewell to the ice fields of golovin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4958,3235-28452-0032,so tardy in leaving in summer and to keechawik and chinik whose clear rushing waters so cheered us in spring time farewell to the moss covered hills and paths thickly bordered with blossoms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

4960,39-121915-0000,but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4961,39-121915-0001,and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4962,39-121915-0002,and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4963,39-121915-0003,miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4964,39-121915-0004,and it took place to the infinite mortification of mister and missus churchill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4965,39-121915-0005,missus weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4966,39-121915-0006,she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4967,39-121915-0007,nor from missing the luxuries of her former home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4968,39-121915-0008,she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe captain weston who had been considered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4969,39-121915-0009,and mister and missus churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4970,39-121915-0010,and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4971,39-121915-0011,having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4972,39-121915-0012,where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realised an easy competence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4973,39-121915-0013,enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4974,39-121915-0014,and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4975,39-121915-0015,till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4976,39-121915-0016,he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4977,39-121915-0017,on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father's assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4978,39-121915-0018,but it was not in mister weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4979,39-121915-0019,mister frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4980,39-121915-0020,but never achieved now upon his father's marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4981,39-121915-0021,either when missus perry drank tea with missus and miss bates or when missus and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mister frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4982,39-121915-0022,when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter missus weston had received,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4983,39-121915-0023,i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mister frank churchill has written to missus weston,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4984,39-121915-0024,missus weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4985,39-121915-0025,and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4986,39-121915-0026,but dear emma was of no feeble character,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
4987,39-121915-0027,and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5116,3879-173592-0033,the spring wore away and no relief appeared one thought now engrossed the colonists that of return to france vasseur's ship the breton still remained in the river,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5117,3879-173592-0034,and they had also the spanish brigantine brought by the mutineers but these vessels were insufficient and they prepared to build a new one the energy of reviving hope lent new life to their exhausted frames,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5119,3879-173592-0036,the maize began to ripen and this brought some relief but the indians exasperated and greedy sold it with reluctance and murdered two half famished frenchmen who gathered a handful in the fields,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5121,3879-173592-0038,and sent back empty handed and half starved they returned to the fort in the words of laudonniere angry and pricked deepely to the quicke for being so mocked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5122,3879-173592-0039,and joined by all their comrades fiercely demanded to be led against outina to seize him punish his insolence and extort from his fears the supplies which could not be looked for from his gratitude the commandant was forced to comply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5123,3879-173592-0040,those who could bear the weight of their armor put it on embarked to the number of fifty in two barges and sailed up the river under laudonniere himself having reached outina's landing they marched inland entered his village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5127,3879-174923-0000,that he should be elected and now he did think it probable that he should get the seat on a petition a scrutiny used to be a very expensive business but under the existing law made as the scrutiny would be in the borough itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5128,3879-174923-0001,it would cost but little and that little should he be successful would fall on the shoulders of mister browborough should he knock off eight votes and lose none himself he would be member for tankerville,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5129,3879-174923-0002,he knew that many votes had been given for browborough which if the truth were known of them would be knocked off and he did not know that the same could be said of any one of those by which he had been supported,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5130,3879-174923-0003,but unfortunately the judge by whom all this would be decided might not reach tankerville in his travels till after christmas perhaps not till after easter and in the meantime what should he do with himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5131,3879-174923-0004,as for going back to dublin that was now out of the question he had entered upon a feverish state of existence in which it was impossible that he should live in ireland,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5132,3879-174923-0005,he must vanish out of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5133,3879-174923-0006,he would not even endeavour to think how he might in such case best bestow himself for the present he would remain within the region of politics and live as near as he could to the whirl of the wheel of which the sound was so dear to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5134,3879-174923-0007,so you're at the old game mister finn said his landlord yes at the old game i suppose it's the same with you now mister bunce had been a very violent politician,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5135,3879-174923-0008,pretty much the same mister finn i don't see that things are much better than they used to be they tell me at the people's banner office that the lords have had as much to do with this election as with any that ever went before it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5136,3879-174923-0009,perhaps they don't know much about it at the people's banner office i thought mister slide and the people's banner had gone over to the other side bunce mister slide is pretty wide awake whatever side he's on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5137,3879-174923-0010,not but what he's disgraced himself by what he's been and done now mister slide in former days had been the editor of the people's banner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5138,3879-174923-0011,but what a man keeps in the way of religion for his own use is never nothing to me as what i keeps is nothing to him i'm afraid you don't keep much mister bunce and that's nothing to you neither is it sir no indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5139,3879-174923-0012,but when we read of churches as is called state churches churches as have bishops you and i have to pay for as never goes into them but we don't pay the bishops mister bunce oh yes we do because if they wasn't paid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5140,3879-174923-0013,the money would come to us to do as we pleased with it we proved all that when we pared them down a bit what's an ecclesiastical commission only another name for a box to put the money into till you want to take it out again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5141,3879-174923-0014,just as the theatres are mister finn or the gin shops then i know there's a deal more to be done before honest men can come by their own you're right enough mister finn you are as far as churches go and you was right too when you cut and run off the treasury bench,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5142,3879-174923-0015,i never expected this but i'll do for you mister finn just as i ever did in the old days and it was i that was sorry when i heard of the poor young lady's death so i was mister finn well then i won't mention her name never again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5143,3879-174923-0016,but after all there's been betwixt you and us it wouldn't be natural to pass it by without one word would it mister finn well yes he's just the same man as ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5144,3879-174923-0017,just as he used to do and never got so much out of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5145,3879-174923-0018,that i don't know how to bear it well yes that is true mister finn there never was a man better at bringing home his money to his wife than bunce,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5146,3879-174923-0019,if he'd drink it which he never does i think i'd bear it better than give it to that nasty union and young jack writes as well as his father pretty nigh mister finn which is a comfort mister bunce was a journeyman scrivener at a law stationer's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5147,3879-174923-0020,and keeps his self but he don't bring home his money nor yet it can't be expected mister finn i know what the young uns will do and what they won't and mary jane is quite handy about the house now only she do break things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5148,3879-174923-0021,which he used to know so well a hundred memories of former days crowded back upon him lord chiltern for a few months had lived with him and then there had arisen a quarrel which he had for a time thought would dissolve his old life into ruin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5149,3879-174923-0022,now lord chiltern was again his very intimate friend and there had used to sit a needy money lender whom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5150,3879-174923-0023,alas alas how soon might he now require that money lender's services and then he recollected how he had left these rooms to go into others grander and more appropriate to his life when he had filled high office under the state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5151,3879-174923-0024,would there ever again come to him such cause for migration and would he again be able to load the frame of the looking glass over the fire with countless cards from countesses and ministers wives he had opened the oyster for himself once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5152,3879-174923-0025,when the point of his knife had been withdrawn would he be able to insert the point again between those two difficult shells would the countesses once more be kind to him would drawing rooms be opened to him and sometimes opened to him and to no other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5153,3879-174923-0026,then he thought of certain special drawing rooms in which wonderful things had been said to him since that he had been a married man and those special drawing rooms and those wonderful words had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5154,3879-174923-0027,he had left all those things of his own free will as though telling himself that there was a better life than they offered to him but was he sure that he had found it to be better he had certainly sighed for the gauds which he had left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5155,3879-174923-0028,while his young wife was living he had kept his sighs down so that she should not hear them but he had been forced to acknowledge that his new life had been vapid and flavourless now he had been tempted back again to the old haunts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5156,3879-174923-0029,would the countesses cards be showered upon him again one card or rather note had reached him while he was yet at tankerville reminding him of old days it was from missus low the wife of the barrister,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5157,3879-174923-0030,with whom he had worked when he had been a law student in london she had asked him to come and dine with them after the old fashion in baker street naming a day as to which she presumed that he would by that time have finished his affairs at tankerville,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5158,3879-174923-0031,intimating also that mister low would then have finished his at north broughton now mister low had sat for north broughton before phineas left london and his wife spoke of the seat as a certainty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5159,3879-174923-0032,phineas could not keep himself from feeling that missus low intended to triumph over him but nevertheless he accepted the invitation they were very glad to see him explaining that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5160,3879-174923-0033,as nobody was supposed to be in town nobody had been asked to meet him in former days he had been very intimate in that house having received from both of them much kindness mingled perhaps with some touch of severity on the part of the lady,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5161,3879-174923-0034,but the ground for that was gone and missus low was no longer painfully severe a few words were said as to his great loss missus low once raised her eyebrows in pretended surprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5162,3879-174923-0035,when phineas explained that he had thrown up his place and then they settled down on the question of the day and so said missus low you've begun to attack the church it must be remembered that at this moment mister daubeny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5163,3879-174923-0036,and if her husband could not be said to live by means of the same atmosphere it was because the breath of his nostrils had been drawn chiefly in the vice chancellor's court in lincoln's inn but he no doubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5164,3879-174923-0037,would be very much disturbed indeed should he ever be told that he was required as an expectant member of mister daubeny's party to vote for the disestablishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5165,3879-174923-0038,you don't mean that i am guilty of throwing the first stone said phineas they have been throwing stones at the temple since first it was built said missus low with energy but they have fallen off its polished shafts in dust and fragments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5166,3879-174923-0039,i am afraid that missus low when she allowed herself to speak thus energetically entertained some confused idea that the church of england and the christian religion were one and the same thing or at least that they had been brought into the world together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5167,3879-174923-0040,you haven't thrown the first stone said mister low but you have taken up the throwing at the first moment in which stones may be dangerous no stones can be dangerous said missus low,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5168,3879-174923-0041,the idea of a state church said phineas is opposed to my theory of political progress what i hope is that my friends will not suppose that i attack the protestant church because i am a roman catholic if i were a priest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5169,3879-174923-0042,it would be my business to do so but i am not a priest mister low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine and in all friendly observances treated him with due affection but neither did he nor did his wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5170,3879-174923-0043,for a moment abstain from attacking their guest in respect to his speeches at tankerville it seemed indeed to phineas that as missus low was buckled up in such triple armour that she feared nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5171,3879-174923-0044,she might have been less loud in expressing her abhorrence of the enemies of the church if she feared nothing why should she scream so loudly between the two he was a good deal crushed and confounded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5172,3879-174923-0045,and missus low was very triumphant when she allowed him to escape from her hands at ten o'clock but at that moment nothing had as yet been heard in baker street of mister daubeny's proposition to the electors of east barsetshire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5173,3879-174923-0046,poor missus low we can foresee that there is much grief in store for her and some rocks ahead too in the political career of her husband phineas was still in london hanging about the clubs doing nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5174,3879-174923-0047,discussing mister daubeny's wonderful treachery with such men as came up to town and waiting for the meeting of parliament when he received the following letter from lady laura kennedy dresden november eighteenth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5175,3879-174923-0048,i have heard with great pleasure from my sister in law that you have been staying with them at harrington hall it seems so like old days that you and oswald and violet should be together so much more natural,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5176,3879-174923-0049,than that you should be living in dublin i cannot conceive of you as living any other life than that of the house of commons downing street and the clubs nor do i wish to do so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5177,3879-174923-0050,and when i hear of you at harrington hall i know that you are on your way to the other things do tell me what life is like with oswald and violet of course he never writes he is one of those men who on marrying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5178,3879-174923-0051,assume that they have at last got a person to do a duty which has always hitherto been neglected violet does write,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5179,3879-174923-0052,as the wife of a master of hounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5180,3879-174923-0053,as the art is real she told me how poor dear lady baldock communicated to you her unhappiness about her daughter in a manner that made even me laugh and would make thousands laugh in days to come were it ever to be published,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5181,3879-174923-0054,but of her inside life of her baby or of her husband as a husband she never says a word you will have seen it all and have enough of the feminine side of a man's character to be able to tell me how they are living,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5182,3879-174923-0055,i am sure they are happy together because violet has more common sense than any woman i ever knew and pray tell me about the affair at tankerville my cousin barrington writes me word that you will certainly get the seat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5183,3879-174923-0056,he declares that mister browborough is almost disposed not to fight the battle though a man more disposed to fight never bribed an elector but barrington seems to think that you managed as well as you did by getting outside the traces as he calls it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5184,3879-174923-0057,we certainly did not think that you would come out strong against the church,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5185,3879-174923-0058,but if it must come why not by your hands as well as by any other it is hardly possible that you in your heart should love a protestant ascendant church but as barrington says a horse won't get oats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5186,3879-174923-0059,at home as you know not only did he take an active part in politics but he was active also in the management of his own property now it seems to him to be almost too great a trouble to write a letter to his steward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5187,3879-174923-0060,or to remain here by myself but he will consent to neither in truth the burden of idleness has now fallen upon him so heavily that he cannot shake it off he dreads that he may be called upon to do anything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5188,3879-174923-0061,to me it is all one tragedy i cannot but think of things as they were two or three years since my father and my husband were both in the cabinet and you young as you were stood but one step below it oswald was out in the cold he was very poor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5189,3879-174923-0062,papa thought all evil of him violet had refused him over and over again he quarrelled with you and all the world seemed against him then of a sudden you vanished and we vanished an ineffable misery fell upon me and upon my wretched husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5190,3879-174923-0063,all our good things went from us at a blow i and my poor father became as it were outcasts but oswald suddenly retricked his beams and is flaming in the forehead of the morning sky he i believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5191,3879-174923-0064,he won his wife honestly did he not and he has ever been honest it is my pride to think i never gave him up but the bitter part of my cup consists in this that as he has won what he has deserved so have we,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5192,3879-174923-0065,i complain of no injustice our castle was built upon the sand why should mister kennedy have been a cabinet minister and why should i have been his wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5193,3879-174923-0066,there is no one whom i can ask to tell me of him that he did not attend during the last session i do know and we presume that he has now abandoned his seat i fear that his health is bad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5194,3879-174923-0067,by the gloom of his life i suppose that he lives exclusively at loughlinter from time to time i am implored by him to return to my duty beneath his roof he grounds his demand on no affection of his own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5195,3879-174923-0068,on no presumption that any affection can remain with me he says no word of happiness he offers no comfort he does not attempt to persuade with promises of future care he makes his claim simply on holy writ and on the feeling of duty which,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5196,3879-174923-0069,thence ought to weigh upon me he has never even told me that he loves me but he is persistent in declaring that those whom god has joined together nothing human should separate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5197,3879-174923-0070,i have told papa that i should ask you and he would be delighted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5198,3879-174923-0071,to be able to talk again to one who knows all the errors and all the efforts of my past life as you do dresden is very cold in the winter i do not know whether you would mind that we are very particular about the rooms but my father bears the temperature wonderfully well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5199,3879-174923-0072,though he complains in march we move down south for a couple of months do come if you can most sincerely yours laura kennedy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5200,887-123289-0000,what happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than i can tell i felt myself hurled into the waves and if i escaped from death and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5201,887-123289-0001,it was because the powerful arm of hans came to my rescue the brave icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves over a burning sand where i found myself by the side of my uncle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5202,887-123289-0002,then he returned to the rocks against which the furious waves were beating to save what he could i was unable to speak i was shattered with fatigue and excitement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5203,887-123289-0003,i wanted a whole hour to recover even a little but a deluge of rain was still falling though with that violence which generally denotes the near cessation of a storm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5204,887-123289-0004,the next day the weather was splendid the sky and the sea had sunk into sudden repose every trace of the awful storm had disappeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5205,887-123289-0005,the exhilarating voice of the professor fell upon my ears as i awoke he was ominously cheerful well my boy he cried have you slept well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5206,887-123289-0006,and that i was only just coming down to breakfast and that i was to be married to graeuben that day alas if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east we should have passed under germany under my beloved town of hamburg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5207,887-123289-0007,under the very street where dwelt all that i loved most in the world then only forty leagues would have separated us but they were forty leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall and in reality we were a thousand leagues asunder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5208,887-123289-0008,all these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before i could answer my uncle's question well now he repeated won't you tell me how you have slept oh very well i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5209,887-123289-0009,i am only a little knocked up but i shall soon be better oh says my uncle that's nothing to signify you are only a little bit tired but you uncle you seem in very good spirits this morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5210,887-123289-0010,but my dear uncle do let me ask you one question of course axel how about returning returning why you are talking about the return before the arrival no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5211,887-123289-0011,i only want to know how that is to be managed in the simplest way possible when we have reached the centre of the globe either we shall find some new way to get back or we shall come back like decent folks the way we came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5212,887-123289-0012,i feel pleased at the thought that it is sure not to be shut against us but then we shall have to refit the raft of course then as to provisions have we enough to last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5213,887-123289-0013,yes to be sure we have hans is a clever fellow and i am sure he must have saved a large part of our cargo but still let us go and make sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5214,887-123289-0014,we left this grotto which lay open to every wind at the same time i cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well it seemed to me impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have destroyed everything on board,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5215,887-123289-0015,on my arrival on the shore i found hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good order my uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude this man with almost superhuman devotion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5216,887-123289-0016,and had saved the most precious of the articles at the risk of his life not that we had suffered no losses for instance our firearms but we might do without them our stock of powder had remained uninjured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5217,887-123289-0017,after having risked blowing up during the storm well cried the professor as we have no guns we cannot hunt that's all yes but how about the instruments here is the aneroid the most useful of all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5218,887-123289-0018,and for which i would have given all the others by means of it i can calculate the depth and know when we have reached the centre without it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5219,887-123289-0019,such high spirits as these were rather too strong but where is the compass i asked here it is upon this rock in perfect condition as well as the thermometers and the chronometer the hunter is a splendid fellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5220,887-123289-0020,there was no denying it we had all our instruments as for tools and appliances there they all lay on the ground ladders ropes picks spades et cetera still there was the question of provisions to be settled and i asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5221,887-123289-0021,how are we off for provisions the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore in a perfect state of preservation for the most part the sea had spared them and what with biscuits salt meat spirits and salt fish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5222,887-123289-0022,four months cried the professor we have time to go and to return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5223,887-123289-0023,i ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's ways yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me now said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5224,887-123289-0024,therefore we shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst as for the raft i will recommend hans to do his best to repair it although i don't expect it will be of any further use to us how so i cried an idea of my own my lad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5225,887-123289-0025,i don't think we shall come out by the way that we went in i stared at the professor with a good deal of mistrust i asked was he not touched in the brain and yet there was method in his madness and now let us go to breakfast said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5226,887-123289-0026,i followed him to a headland after he had given his instructions to the hunter there preserved meat biscuit and tea made us an excellent meal one of the best i ever remember hunger the fresh air the calm quiet weather,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5227,887-123289-0027,after the commotions we had gone through all contributed to give me a good appetite whilst breakfasting i took the opportunity to put to my uncle the question where we were now that seems to me i said rather difficult to make out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5228,887-123289-0028,yes it is difficult he said to calculate exactly perhaps even impossible since during these three stormy days i have been unable to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft but still we may get an approximation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5229,887-123289-0029,the last observation i remarked was made on the island when the geyser was you mean axel island don't decline the honour of having given your name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the globe well said i,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5230,887-123289-0030,let it be axel island then we had cleared two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were six hundred leagues from iceland very well answered my uncle let us start from that point and count four days storm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5231,887-123289-0031,surely axel it may vie in size with the mediterranean itself especially i replied if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part and it is a curious circumstance i added that if my computations are right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5232,887-123289-0032,that is a good long way my friend but whether we are under turkey or the atlantic depends very much upon the question,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5233,887-123289-0033,perhaps we have deviated no i think not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5234,887-123289-0034,well replied my uncle we may easily ascertain this by consulting the compass let us go and see what it says the professor moved towards the rock upon which hans had laid down the instruments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5235,887-123289-0035,he was gay and full of spirits he rubbed his hands he studied his attitudes i followed him curious to know if i was right in my estimate as soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle took the compass laid it horizontally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5236,887-123289-0036,and questioned the needle which after a few oscillations presently assumed a fixed position my uncle looked and looked and looked again he rubbed his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5237,887-123289-0037,and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery what is the matter i asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5238,887-123289-0038,an exclamation of astonishment burst from me the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea i shook the box examined it again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5239,887-123289-0039,it was in perfect condition in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5240,887-123291-0000,chapter thirty eight the professor in his chair again to understand this apostrophe of my uncle's made to absent french savants it will be necessary to allude to an event of high importance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5241,887-123291-0001,in a palaeontological point of view which had occurred a little while before our departure on the twenty eighth of march eighteen sixty three,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5242,887-123291-0002,near abbeville in the department of somme found a human jawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface it was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light not far distant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5243,887-123291-0003,were found stone hatchets and flint arrow heads stained and encased by lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust the noise of this discovery was very great not in france alone but in england and in germany,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5244,887-123291-0004,saw at once the importance of this discovery proved to demonstration the genuineness of the bone in question and became the most ardent defendants in what the english called this trial of a jawbone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5245,887-123291-0005,therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5246,887-123291-0006,and agreeing in that with cuvier he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period my uncle liedenbrock along with the great body of the geologists had maintained his ground disputed and argued until,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5247,887-123291-0007,we knew all these details but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages other similar maxillaries though belonging to individuals of various types and different nations were found in the loose grey soil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5248,887-123291-0008,of certain grottoes in france switzerland and belgium as well as weapons tools earthen utensils bones of children and adults the existence therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more certain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5249,887-123291-0009,nor was this all fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still it is true that these remains were not human bones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5250,887-123291-0010,but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork such as fossil leg bones of animals sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5251,887-123291-0011,he was a predecessor of the mastodon he was a contemporary of the southern elephant he lived a hundred thousand years ago when according to geologists the pleiocene formation was in progress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5252,887-123291-0012,such then was the state of palaeontological science and what we knew of it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this stupendous golgotha any one may now understand the frenzied excitement of my uncle when,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5253,887-123291-0013,twenty yards farther on he found himself face to face with a primitive man it was a perfectly recognisable human body had some particular soil like that of the cemetery saint michel at bordeaux,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5254,887-123291-0014,preserved it thus for so many ages it might be so but this dried corpse with its parchment like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame the limbs still preserving their shape sound teeth abundant hair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5255,887-123291-0015,and finger and toe nails of frightful length this desiccated mummy startled us by appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago i stood mute before this apparition of remote antiquity my uncle usually so garrulous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5256,887-123291-0016,was struck dumb likewise we raised the body we stood it up against a rock it seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits we sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame after some moments silence the professor was himself again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5257,887-123291-0017,otto liedenbrock yielding to his nature forgot all the circumstances of our eventful journey forgot where we were standing forgot the vaulted cavern which contained us no doubt he was in mind back again in his johannaeum,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5258,887-123291-0018,holding forth to his pupils for he assumed his learned air and addressing himself to an imaginary audience he proceeded thus gentlemen i have the honour to introduce to you a man of the quaternary or post tertiary system,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5259,887-123291-0019,eminent geologists have denied his existence others no less eminent have affirmed it the saint thomases of palaeontology if they were here might now touch him with their fingers and would be obliged to acknowledge their error,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5260,887-123291-0020,i am quite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of this kind i know what capital enterprising individuals like barnum have made out of fossil men i have heard the tale of the kneepan of ajax,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5261,887-123291-0021,the pretended body of orestes claimed to have been found by the spartans and of the body of asterius ten cubits long,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5262,887-123291-0022,i have read the reports of the skeleton of trapani found in the fourteenth century and which was at the time identified as that of polyphemus and the history of the giant unearthed in the sixteenth century near palermo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5263,887-123291-0023,you know as well as i do gentlemen the analysis made at lucerne in fifteen seventy seven of those huge bones which the celebrated doctor felix plater affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen feet high,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5264,887-123291-0024,in the eighteenth century i would have stood up for scheuchzer's pre adamite man against peter campet i have perused a writing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5265,887-123291-0025,here my uncle's unfortunate infirmity met him that of being unable in public to pronounce hard words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5266,887-123291-0026,he could get no further,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5267,887-123291-0027,it was not to be done the unlucky word would not come out at the johannaeum there would have been a laugh gigantosteologie at last the professor burst out between two words which i shall not record here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5268,887-123291-0028,have recognised in these bones nothing more remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the post tertiary period but in the presence of this specimen to doubt would be to insult science there stands the body you may see it touch it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5269,887-123291-0029,it is not a mere skeleton it is an entire body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5270,887-123291-0030,i was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion if i could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid pursued my uncle i should be able to clear it from all the earthy particles and the shells which are incrusted about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5271,887-123291-0031,but i do not possess that valuable solvent yet such as it is the body shall tell us its own wonderful story here the professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton and handled it with the skill of a dexterous showman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5272,887-123291-0032,you see he said that it is not six feet long and that we are still separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5273,887-123291-0033,it is evidently caucasian it is the white race our own the skull of this fossil is a regular oval or rather ovoid it exhibits no prominent cheekbones no projecting jaws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5274,887-123291-0034,it presents no appearance of that prognathism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5275,887-123291-0035,it is nearly ninety degrees but i will go further in my deductions and i will affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the japhetic race which has since spread from the indies to the atlantic don't smile gentlemen nobody was smiling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5276,887-123291-0036,but the learned professor was frequently disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities yes he pursued with animation this is a fossil man the contemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5277,887-123291-0037,how those strata on which he lay slipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe i confess i cannot answer that question,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5278,887-123291-0038,considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth the long continued cooling of the globe produced chasms fissures clefts and faults into which very probably portions of the upper earth may have fallen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5279,887-123291-0039,but there is the man surrounded by his own works by hatchets by flint arrow heads,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5280,887-123291-0040,this fossil body was not the only one in this immense catacomb we came upon other bodies at every step amongst this mortal dust and my uncle might select the most curious of these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5281,887-123291-0041,in fact it was a wonderful spectacle that of these generations of men and animals commingled in a common cemetery then one very serious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5282,887-123291-0042,had all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust of the earth down to the shores of the liedenbrock sea when they were dead and turning to dust or had they lived and grown and died here in this subterranean world under a false sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5283,887-123290-0000,we had gone backwards instead of forwards but my uncle rapidly recovered himself aha will fate play tricks upon me will the elements lay plots against me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5284,887-123290-0001,shall fire air and water make a combined attack against me well they shall know what a determined man can do i will not yield i will not stir a single foot backwards and it will be seen whether man or nature is to have the upper hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5285,887-123290-0002,erect upon the rock angry and threatening otto liedenbrock was a rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce achilles defying the lightning but i thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5286,887-123290-0003,just listen to me i said firmly ambition must have a limit somewhere we cannot perform impossibilities we are not at all fit for another sea voyage who would dream of undertaking a voyage of five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5287,887-123290-0004,with a blanket in rags for a sail a stick for a mast and fierce winds in our teeth we cannot steer we shall be buffeted by the tempests and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5288,887-123290-0005,i was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten minutes without interruption not that the professor was paying any respectful attention to his nephew's arguments but because he was deaf to all my eloquence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5289,887-123290-0006,to the raft he shouted such was his only reply it was no use for me to entreat supplicate get angry or do anything else in the way of opposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5290,887-123290-0007,hans was finishing the repairs of the raft one would have thought that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions with a few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5291,887-123290-0008,a sail already hung from the new mast and the wind was playing in its waving folds the professor said a few words to the guide and immediately he put everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5292,887-123290-0009,the air was clear and the north west wind blew steadily what could i do could i stand against the two it was impossible if hans had but taken my side but no it was not to be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5293,887-123290-0010,the icelander seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget and deny himself i could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised as it were to his master my only course was to proceed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5294,887-123290-0011,i was therefore going with as much resignation as i could find to resume my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle laid his hand upon my shoulder we shall not sail until to morrow he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5295,887-123290-0012,i will not leave it until i have examined it to understand what followed it must be borne in mind that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5296,887-123290-0013,we were not really where the professor supposed we were in fact we were not upon the north shore of the sea now let us start upon fresh discoveries i said and leaving hans to his work we started off together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5297,887-123290-0014,the space between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable it took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock we trampled under our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed in the earliest ages of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5298,887-123290-0015,i also saw immense carapaces more than fifteen feet in diameter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5299,887-123290-0016,and ridged up in successive lines i was therefore led to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the ground on which we were treading on the loose and scattered rocks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5300,887-123290-0017,the waves had left manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone this might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe but in my opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5301,887-123290-0018,this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within the interior of the earth and it certainly had its origin in the waters of the ocean overhead which had made their way hither through some fissure yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5302,887-123290-0019,it must be believed that that fissure is now closed and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a very short time perhaps even this water subjected to the fierce action of central heat had partly been resolved into vapour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5303,887-123290-0020,and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests within the bowels of the earth this theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to me for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5304,887-123290-0021,fixed physical laws will or may always explain them we were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil the deposits of the waters of former ages the professor was carefully examining every little fissure in the rocks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5305,887-123290-0022,wherever he saw a hole he always wanted to know the depth of it to him this was important we had traversed the shores of the liedenbrock sea for a mile when we observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil it seemed upset contorted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5306,887-123290-0023,where the remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together huge mounds of bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance they undulated away to the limits of the horizon and melted in the distance in a faint,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5307,887-123290-0024,haze there within three square miles were accumulated the materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages a history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5308,887-123290-0025,but an impatient curiosity impelled our steps crackling and rattling our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric animals and interesting fossils the possession of which is a matter of rivalry and contention,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5309,887-123290-0026,a thousand cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection i stood amazed my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5310,887-123290-0027,his mouth gaping wide his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles his head balancing with an up and down motion his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5311,887-123290-0028,leptotheria mericotheria lophiodia anoplotheria megatheria mastodons protopithecae pterodactyles and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5312,887-123290-0029,fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandrian library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle professor liedenbrock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5313,887-123290-0030,but more was to come when,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5314,887-123290-0031,he laid his hand upon a bare skull and cried with a voice trembling with excitement axel axel a human head a human skull i cried no less astonished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5315,3436-172162-0000,the adventure of the cart it befell in the month of may queen guenever called to her knights of the table round and gave them warning that early upon the morrow she would ride a maying into the woods and fields beside westminster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5316,3436-172162-0001,and i warn you that there be none of you but he be well horsed and that ye all be clothed in green either silk or cloth and i shall bring with me ten ladies and every knight shall have a lady behind him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5317,3436-172162-0002,and every knight shall have a squire and two yeoman and all well horsed for thus it chanced one morn when all the court green suited but with plumes that mock'd the may had been their wont a maying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5318,3436-172162-0003,so they made them ready and these were the names of the knights sir kay the seneschal sir agrivaine sir brandiles sir sagramour le desirus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5319,3436-172162-0004,sir dodynas le sauvage sir ozanna sir ladynas sir persant of inde sir ironside and sir pelleas and these ten knights made them ready,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5320,3436-172162-0005,so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen and rode a maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them in great joy and delight now there was a knight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5321,3436-172162-0006,son to king brademagus who loved queen guenever passing well and so had he done long and many years now this knight sir maleagans learned the queen's purpose and that she had no men of arms with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5322,3436-172162-0007,but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for maying so he prepared him twenty men of arms and a hundred archers to take captive the queen and her knights,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5323,3436-172162-0008,in the merry month of may in a morn at break of day with a troop of damsels playing the queen forsooth went forth a maying old song so when the queen had mayed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5324,3436-172162-0009,traitor knight said queen guenever what wilt thou do wilt thou shame thyself bethink thee how thou art a king's son and a knight of the table round and how thou art about to dishonor all knighthood and thyself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5325,3436-172162-0010,be it as it may said sir maleagans know you well madam i have loved you many a year and never till now could i get you to such advantage as i do now and therefore i will take you as i find you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5326,3436-172162-0011,then the ten knights of the round table drew their swords and the other party run at them with their spears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5327,3436-172162-0012,then they lashed together with swords till several were smitten to the earth so when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully oppressed and needs must be slain at the last then for pity and sorrow she cried sir maleagans,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5328,3436-172162-0013,slay not my noble knights and i will go with you upon this covenant that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5329,3436-172162-0014,madame said maleagans for your sake they shall be led with you into my own castle if that ye will be ruled and ride with me then sir maleagans charged them all that none should depart from the queen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5330,3436-172162-0015,for he dreaded lest sir launcelot should have knowledge of what had been done then the queen privily called unto her a page of her chamber that was swiftly horsed to whom she said go thou when thou seest thy time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5331,3436-172162-0016,and bear this ring unto sir launcelot and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescue me and spare not thy horse said the queen neither for water nor for land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5332,3436-172162-0017,and lightly he took his horse with the spurs and departed as fast as he might and when sir maleagans saw him so flee he understood that it was by the queen's commandment for to warn sir launcelot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5333,3436-172162-0018,then they that were best horsed chased him and shot at him but the child went from them all then sir maleagans said to the queen madam ye are about to betray me but i shall arrange for sir launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5334,3436-172162-0019,then he rode with her and them all to his castle in all the haste that they might and by the way sir maleagans laid in ambush the best archers that he had to wait for sir launcelot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5335,3436-172162-0020,and the child came to westminster and found sir launcelot and told his message and delivered him the queen's ring alas said sir launcelot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5336,3436-172162-0021,unless i may rescue that noble lady then eagerly he asked his armor and put it on him and mounted his horse and rode as fast as he might,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5337,3436-172162-0022,and men say he took the water at westminster bridge and made his horse swim over thames unto lambeth then within a while he came to a wood where was a narrow way and there the archers were laid in ambush,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5338,3436-172162-0023,and they shot at him and smote his horse so that he fell then sir launcelot left his horse and went on foot but there lay so many ditches and hedges betwixt the archers and him that he might not meddle with them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5339,3436-172162-0024,alas for shame said sir launcelot that ever one knight should betray another but it is an old saw a good man is never in danger but when he is in danger of a coward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5340,3436-172162-0025,then sir launcelot went awhile and he was exceedingly cumbered by his armor his shield and his spear and all that belonged to him then by chance there came by him a cart that came thither to fetch wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5341,3436-172162-0026,carts were little used except for carrying offal and for conveying criminals to execution but sir launcelot took no thought of anything but the necessity of haste for the purpose of rescuing the queen so he demanded of the carter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5342,3436-172162-0027,that he should take him in and convey him as speedily as possible for a liberal reward the carter consented and sir launcelot placed himself in the cart and only lamented that with much jolting he made but little progress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5343,3436-172162-0028,he drew near to see who it might be then sir launcelot told him how the queen had been carried off and how in hastening to her rescue his horse had been disabled and he had been compelled to avail himself of the cart rather than give up his enterprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5344,3436-172162-0029,then sir gawain said surely it is unworthy of a knight to travel in such sort but sir launcelot heeded him not at nightfall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5345,3436-172162-0030,but to admit his companion whom she supposed to be a criminal or at least a prisoner it pleased her not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5346,3436-172162-0031,at supper sir launcelot came near being consigned to the kitchen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5347,3436-172162-0032,neither would the damsels prepare a bed for him he seized the first he found unoccupied and was left undisturbed next morning he saw from the turrets of the castle a train accompanying a lady whom he imagined to be the queen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5348,3436-172162-0033,the lady of the castle supplied sir launcelot with a horse and they traversed the plain at full speed they learned from some travellers whom they met that there were two roads which led to the castle of sir maleagans here therefore the friends separated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5349,3436-172162-0034,sir launcelot found his way beset with obstacles which he encountered successfully but not without much loss of time as evening approached he was met by a young and sportive damsel who gayly proposed to him a supper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5350,3436-172162-0035,at her castle the knight who was hungry and weary accepted the offer though with no very good grace he followed the lady to her castle and ate voraciously of her supper but was quite impenetrable to all her amorous advances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5351,3436-172162-0036,suddenly the scene changed and he was assailed by six furious ruffians whom he dealt with so vigorously that most of them were speedily disabled when again there was a change and he found himself alone with his fair hostess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5352,3436-172162-0037,which she told him would by its changes of color disclose to him all enchantments and enable him to subdue them sir launcelot pursued his journey without being much incommoded except by the taunts of travellers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5353,3436-172162-0038,who all seemed to have learned by some means his disgraceful drive in the cart one more insolent than the rest had the audacity to interrupt him during dinner and even to risk a battle in support of his pleasantry launcelot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5354,3436-172162-0039,after an easy victory only doomed him to be carted in his turn at night he was received at another castle with great apparent hospitality but found himself in the morning in a dungeon and loaded with chains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5355,3436-172162-0040,consulting his ring and finding that this was an enchantment he burst his chains seized his armor in spite of the visionary monsters who attempted to defend it broke open the gates of the tower and continued his journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5356,3436-172162-0041,at length his progress was checked by a wide and rapid torrent which could only be passed on a narrow bridge on which a false step would prove his destruction launcelot leading his horse by the bridle and making him swim by his side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5357,3436-172162-0042,passed over the bridge and was attacked as soon as he reached the bank by a lion and a leopard both of which he slew and then exhausted and bleeding seated himself on the grass and endeavored to bind up his wounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5358,3436-172162-0043,offered him his assistance and informed him that the queen was safe in his castle but could only be rescued by encountering maleagans launcelot demanded the battle for the next day and accordingly it took place at the foot of the tower,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5359,3436-172162-0044,and under the eyes of the fair captive launcelot was enfeebled by his wounds and fought not with his usual spirit and the contest for a time was doubtful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5360,3436-172162-0045,ah launcelot my knight truly have i been told that thou art no longer worthy of me these words instantly revived the drooping knight he resumed at once his usual superiority and soon laid at his feet his haughty adversary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5361,3436-172162-0046,moved by the entreaties of brademagus ordered him to withhold the blow and he obeyed the castle and its prisoners were now at his disposal launcelot hastened to the apartment of the queen threw himself at her feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5363,3436-172162-0048,for her lover suddenly started from her and bitterly lamenting that he had incurred the displeasure of his sovereign lady rushed out of the castle threw his sword and his shield to the right and left ran furiously into the woods and disappeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5364,3436-172162-0049,it seems that the story of the abominable cart which haunted launcelot at every step had reached the ears of sir kay who had told it to the queen as a proof that her knight must have been dishonored,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5365,3436-172162-0050,three days elapsed during which launcelot wandered without knowing where he went till at last he began to reflect that his mistress had doubtless been deceived by misrepresentation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5366,3436-172162-0051,and that it was his duty to set her right he therefore returned compelled maleagans to release his prisoners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5370,3436-172171-0002,not only the animals of the chase for the table but even birds on the wing at length however perceval was roused to a desire of military renown by seeing in the forest five knights who were in complete armor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5371,3436-172171-0003,he said to his mother mother what are those yonder they are angels my son said she by my faith i will go and become an angel with them and perceval went to the road and met them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5374,3436-172171-0006,and perceval in return gave him such information as he had then perceval returned to his mother and said to her mother those were not angels but honorable knights then his mother swooned away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5375,3436-172171-0007,and perceval went to the place where they kept the horses that carried firewood and provisions for the castle and he took a bony piebald horse which seemed to him the strongest of them and he pressed a pack into the form of a saddle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5376,3436-172171-0008,and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses when he came again to his mother the countess had recovered from her swoon my son said she desirest thou to ride forth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5380,3436-172171-0012,perceiving in one corner of the tent some food two flasks full of wine and some boar's flesh roasted he said my mother told me whenever i saw meat and drink to take it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5381,3436-172171-0013,and he ate greedily for he was very hungry the maiden said sir thou hadst best go quickly from here for fear that my friends should come and evil should befall you but perceval said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5382,3436-172171-0014,and he gave the maiden his own ring in exchange for hers then he mounted his horse and rode away perceval journeyed on till he arrived at arthur's court and it so happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5383,3436-172171-0015,for when her page was serving the queen with a golden goblet this knight struck the arm of the page and dashed the wine in the queen's face and over her stomacher then he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5384,3436-172171-0016,let him follow me to the meadow so the knight took his horse and rode to the meadow carrying away the golden goblet and all the household hung down their heads and no one offered to follow the knight to take vengeance upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5385,3436-172171-0017,for it seemed to them that no one would have ventured on so daring an outrage unless he possessed such powers through magic or charms that none could be able to punish him just then behold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5388,3436-172171-0020,then all the household began to jeer and laugh at him but there was a certain damsel who had been a whole year at arthur's court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5390,3436-172171-0022,and carried a bell or bawble in his hand though called a fool his words were often weighed and remembered as if there were a sort of oracular meaning in them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5391,3436-172171-0023,till she had seen him who would be the flower of chivalry now this damsel came up to perceval and told him smiling that if he lived he would be one of the bravest and best of knights truly said kay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5392,3436-172171-0024,thou art ill taught to remain a year at arthur's court with choice of society and smile on no one and now before the face of arthur and all his knights to call such a man as this the flower of knighthood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5393,3436-172171-0025,that she fell senseless to the ground then said kay to perceval go after the knight who went hence to the meadow overthrow him and recover the golden goblet and possess thyself of his horse and arms and thou shalt have knighthood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5394,3436-172171-0026,i will do so tall man said perceval so he turned his horse's head toward the meadow and when he came there the knight was riding up and down proud of his strength and valor and noble mien tell me said the knight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5395,3436-172171-0027,didst thou see any one coming after me from the court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5396,3436-172171-0028,and to take from thee the goblet and thy horse and armor for myself silence said the knight go back to the court and tell arthur either to come himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5397,3436-172171-0029,and unless he do so quickly i will not wait for him by my faith said perceval choose thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly for i will have the horse and the arms and the goblet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5398,3436-172171-0030,upon this the knight ran at him furiously and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5399,3436-172171-0031,my mother's servants were not used to play with me in this wise so thus will i play with thee and he threw at him one of his sharp pointed sticks and it struck him in the eye and came out at the back of his head so that he fell down lifeless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5400,3436-172171-0032,verily said sir owain the son of urien to kay the seneschal thou wast ill advised to send that madman after the knight for he must either be overthrown or flee and either way it will be a disgrace to arthur and his warriors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5401,3436-172171-0033,therefore will i go to see what has befallen him so sir owain went to the meadow and he found perceval trying in vain to get the dead knight's armor off in order to clothe himself with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5402,3436-172171-0034,sir owain unfastened the armor and helped perceval to put it on and taught him how to put his foot in the stirrup and use the spur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5403,3436-172171-0035,and urged on his horse with a stick then owain would have had him return to the court to receive the praise that was his due but perceval said i will not come to the court till i have encountered the tall man that is there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5404,3436-172171-0036,to revenge the injury he did to the maiden but take thou the goblet to queen guenever and tell king arthur that wherever i am i will be his vassal and will do him what profit and service i can and sir owain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5405,3436-172171-0037,went back to the court and related all these things to arthur and guenever and to all the household,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5406,3436-172171-0038,and he came to a lake on the side of which was a fair castle and on the border of the lake he saw a hoary headed man sitting upon a velvet cushion and his attendants were fishing in the lake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5407,3436-172171-0039,when the hoary headed man beheld perceval approaching he arose and went into the castle perceval rode to the castle and the door was open and he entered the hall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5408,3436-172171-0040,and the hoary headed man received perceval courteously and asked him to sit by him on the cushion when it was time the tables were set and they went to meat and when they had finished their meat the hoary headed man asked perceval,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5409,3436-172171-0041,if he knew how to fight with the sword i know not said perceval but were i to be taught doubtless i should and the hoary headed man said to him i am thy uncle thy mother's brother i am called king pecheur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5410,3436-172171-0042,footnote the word means both fisher and sinner thou shalt remain with me a space in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries and courtesy and noble bearing and this do thou remember,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5411,3436-172171-0043,if thou seest aught to cause thy wonder ask not the meaning of it if no one has the courtesy to inform thee the reproach will not fall upon thee but upon me that am thy teacher,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5412,3436-172171-0044,while perceval and his uncle discoursed together perceval beheld two youths enter the hall bearing a golden cup and a spear of mighty size with blood dropping from its point to the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5413,3436-172171-0045,and when all the company saw this they began to weep and lament but for all that the man did not break off his discourse with perceval and as he did not tell him the meaning of what he saw he forebore to ask him concerning it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5414,3436-172171-0046,now the cup that perceval saw was the sangreal and the spear the sacred spear and afterwards king pecheur removed with those sacred relics into a far country one evening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5415,3436-172171-0047,perceval entered a valley and came to a hermit's cell and the hermit welcomed him gladly and there he spent the night and in the morning he arose and when he went forth behold a shower of snow had fallen in the night and a hawk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5416,3436-172171-0048,had killed a wild fowl in front of the cell and the noise of the horse had scared the hawk away and a raven alighted on the bird and perceval stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5417,3436-172171-0049,to the hair of the lady that best he loved which was blacker than jet and to her skin which was whiter than the snow and to the two red spots upon her cheeks which were redder than the blood upon the snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5418,3436-172171-0050,now arthur and his household were in search of perceval and by chance they came that way know ye said arthur who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook up yonder lord said one of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5419,3436-172171-0051,i will go and learn who he is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5420,3436-172171-0052,and who he was but perceval was so intent upon his thought that he gave him no answer then the youth thrust at perceval with his lance and perceval turned upon him and struck him to the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5421,3436-172171-0053,and when the youth returned to the king and told how rudely he had been treated sir kay said i will go myself and when he greeted perceval and got no answer he spoke to him rudely and angrily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5422,3436-172171-0054,and perceval thrust at him with his lance and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade and while he lay thus stunned his horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace then said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5423,3436-172171-0055,surnamed the golden tongued because he was the most courteous knight in arthur's court it is not fitting that any should disturb an honorable knight from his thought unadvisedly for either he is pondering some damage that he has sustained,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5424,3436-172171-0056,or he is thinking of the lady whom best he loves if it seem well to thee lord i will go and see if this knight has changed from his thought and if he has i will ask him courteously to come and visit thee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5425,3436-172171-0057,and perceval was resting on the shaft of his spear pondering the same thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5426,3436-172171-0058,if i thought it would be as agreeable to thee as it would be to me i would converse with thee i have also a message from arthur unto thee to pray thee to come and visit him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5427,3436-172171-0059,and two men have been before on this errand that is true said perceval and uncourteously they came they attacked me and i was annoyed thereat then he told him the thought that occupied his mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5428,3436-172171-0060,and gawain said this was not an ungentle thought and i should marvel if it were pleasant for thee to be drawn from it then said perceval tell me is sir kay in arthur's court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5429,3436-172171-0061,and truly he is the knight who fought with thee last verily said perceval i am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the smiling maiden then perceval told him his name and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5431,3436-172171-0063,i am right glad to meet thee said perceval for i have everywhere heard of thy prowess and uprightness and i solicit thy fellowship thou shalt have it by my faith and grant me thine said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5432,3436-172171-0064,gladly will i do so answered perceval so they went together to arthur and saluted him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5433,3436-172171-0065,him whom thou hast sought so long welcome unto thee chieftain said arthur and hereupon there came the queen and her handmaidens and perceval saluted them and they were rejoiced to see him and bade him welcome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5434,8088-284756-0000,from somewhere out on the black heaving atlantic the rapid muffled popping of a speed boat's exhaust drifted clearly through the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5435,8088-284756-0001,there was real romance and adventure rum runners seeking out their hidden port with their cargo of contraband from cuba heading fearlessly through the darkness fighting the high seas still running after the storm of a day or so before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5437,8088-284756-0003,absorbed in my mental picture of these modern free booters the sudden alarm of the telephone startled me like an unexpected shot fired beside my ear brushing the cigarette ashes from my smoking jacket i crossed the room and snatched up the receiver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5440,8088-284756-0006,i had never heard mercer speak in that high pitched excited voice before his usual speech was slow and thoughtful almost didactic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5443,8088-284756-0009,a moment later i was off the gravelled drive and tearing down the concrete with the accelerator all the way down and the black wind shrieking around the windshield of my little roadster my own shack was out of the city limits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5444,8088-284756-0010,mercer picked the place up for me at a song the monstrosity was some four miles further out from town and off the highway perhaps a half mile more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5445,8088-284756-0011,i made the four miles in just a shade over that many minutes and clamped on the brakes as i saw the entrance to the little drive that led toward the sea and mercer's estate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5446,8088-284756-0012,with gravel rattling on my fenders i turned off the concrete and swept between the two massive stuccoed pillars that guarded the drive both of them bore corroded bronze plates the billows the name given the monstrosity by the original owner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5447,8088-284756-0013,a newly rich munitions manufacturer the structure itself loomed up before me in a few seconds a rambling affair with square shouldered balconies and a great deal of wrought iron work after the most flamboyant spanish pattern it was ablaze with light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5448,8088-284756-0014,apparently every bulb in the place was burning just a few yards beyond the surf boomed hollowly on the smooth shady shore littered now i knew by the pitiful spoils of the storm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5449,8088-284756-0015,as i clamped on my brakes a swift shadow passed two of the lower windows before i could leap from the car the broad front door with its rounded top and circular grilled window was flung wide and mercer came running to meet me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5450,8088-284756-0016,he was wearing a bathrobe hastily flung on over a damp bathing suit his bare legs terminating in a pair of disreputable slippers fine taylor he greeted me i suppose you're wondering what it's all about i don't blame you but come in come in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5452,8088-284756-0018,mercer he laughed excitedly you'll see you'll see no i'm not in love and i want you to help and not admire there are only carson and myself here you know and the job's too big for the two of us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5453,8088-284756-0019,he hurried me across the broad concrete porch and into the house throw the cap anywhere and come on too much amazed to comment further i followed my friend this was a warren mercer i did not know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5454,8088-284756-0020,his eyes dark and large smiled easily and shone with interest but his almost beautiful mouth beneath the long slim mustache always closely cropped seldom smiled with his eyes but it was his present excited speech that amazed me most,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5455,8088-284756-0021,mercer during all the years i had known him had never been moved before to such tempestuous outbursts of enthusiasm it was his habit to speak slowly and thoughtfully in his low musical voice even in the midst of our hottest arguments and we had had many of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5456,8088-284756-0022,the other end of the room was nearly all glass and opened onto the patio and the swimming pool mercer paused a moment with his hand on the knob of the door a strange light in his dark eyes now you'll see why i called you here he said tensely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5457,8088-284756-0023,you can judge for yourself whether the trip was worth while here she is with a gesture he flung open the door and i stared following his glance down at the great tiled swimming pool it is difficult for me to describe the scene,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5458,8088-284756-0024,the patio was not large but it was beautifully done flowers and shrubs even a few small palms grew in profusion in the enclosure while above through the movable glass roof made in sections to disappear in fine weather,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5459,8088-284756-0025,was the empty blackness of the sky none of the lights provided for the illumination of the covered patio was turned on but all the windows surrounding the patio were aglow and i could see the pool quite clearly the pool and its occupant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5460,8088-284756-0026,we were standing at one side of the pool near the center directly opposite us seated on the bottom of the pool was a human figure nude save for a great mass of tawny hair that fell about her like a silken mantle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5461,8088-284756-0027,even in the soft light i could see her perfectly through the clear water her pale body outlined sharply against the jade green tiles i tore myself away from the staring curious eyes of the figure in god's name mercer what is it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5462,8088-284756-0028,porcelain i asked hoarsely the thing had an indescribably eery effect he laughed wildly porcelain watch look my eyes followed his pointing finger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5463,8088-284756-0029,the great cloud of corn colored hair floated down about it falling below the knees slowly with a grace of movement comparable only with the slow soaring of a gull she came toward me walking on the bottom of the pool through the clear water as though she floated in air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5464,8088-284756-0030,fascinated i watched her her eyes startlingly large and dark in the strangely white face were fixed on mine there was nothing sinister in the gaze yet i felt my body shaking as though in the grip of a terrible fear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5465,8088-284756-0031,i tried to look away and found myself unable to move i felt mercer's tense sudden grip upon my arm but i did not could not look at him she she's smiling i heard him exclaim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5466,8088-284756-0032,he laughed an excited high pitched laugh that irritated me in some subtle way she was smiling and looking up into my eyes she was very close now within a few feet of us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5467,8088-284756-0033,and her bosom rising and falling beneath the veil of pale gold hair she was breathing water mercer literally jerked me away from the edge of the pool,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5468,8088-284756-0034,he asked his dark eyes dancing with excitement tell me about it i said shaking my head dazedly she is not human i don't know i think so as human as you or i i'll tell you all i know and then you can judge for yourself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5469,8088-284756-0035,i think we'll know in a few minutes if my plans work out but first slip on a bathing suit i didn't argue the matter i let mercer lead me away without a word and while i was changing he told me all he knew of the strange creature in the pool,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5470,8088-284756-0036,late this afternoon i decided to go for a little walk along the beach mercer began i had been working like the devil since early in the morning running some tests on what you call my thought telegraph i felt the need of some fresh sea air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5471,8088-284756-0037,i walked along briskly for perhaps five minutes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5472,8088-284756-0038,the shore was littered with all sorts of flotsam and jetsam washed up by the big storm and i was just thinking that i would have to have a man with a truck come and clean up the shore in front of the place when in a little sandy pool i saw her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5473,8088-284756-0039,she was laying face down in the water motionless her head towards the sea one arm stretched out before her and her long hair wrapped around her like a half transparent cloak i ran up and lifted her from the water her body was cold and deathly white,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5474,8088-284756-0040,and took the liquor in a single draught she did not seem to drink it but sucked it out of the glass in a single amazing gulp that's the only word for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5475,8088-284756-0041,webbed i asked startled webbed nodded mercer solemnly as are her feet but listen taylor i was amazed and not a little rattled when she came for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5476,8088-284756-0042,i ran through the french windows out into the patio for a moment she ran after me rather awkwardly and heavily but swiftly nevertheless then she saw the pool apparently forgetting that i existed she leaped into the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5477,8088-284756-0043,i reminded him as he paused apparently lost in thought i tried to find out more about her i put on my bathing suit and dived into the pool well she came at me like a shark quick as a flash her teeth showing her hands tearing like claws through the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5478,8088-284756-0044,she managed to claw me just once mercer resumed wrapping the robe about him again then i got out and called on carson for help i put him into a bathing suit and we both endeavored to corner her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5479,8088-284756-0045,carson got two bad scratches and one rather serious bite that i have bandaged i have a number of lacerations but i didn't fare so badly as carson because i am faster in the water than he is the harder we tried the more determined i became,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5480,8088-284756-0046,we moved out of the room nothing human can live under water and breathe water as she does mercer paused a moment staring at me oddly the human race he said gravely came up out of sea the human race as we know it some may have gone back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5481,8088-284756-0047,mercer some may have gone back i don't get it mercer shook his head but made no other reply until we stood again on the edge of the pool the girl was standing where we had left her and as she looked up into my face she smiled again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5482,8088-284756-0048,and in that white bathing suit yes i believe she's taken a fancy to you mercer's eyes were dancing if she has he went on it'll make our work very easy what work i asked suspiciously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5483,8088-284756-0049,i think i have what you call my thought telegraph perfected experimentally he explained rapidly i fell asleep working on it at three o'clock or thereabouts this morning and some tests with carson seem to indicate that it is a success,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5484,8088-284756-0050,i should have called you to morrow for further test nearly five years of damned hard work to a successful conclusion taylor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5485,8088-284756-0051,i asked eagerly glancing down at the beautiful pale face that glimmered up at me through the clear water of the pool why try it on her exclaimed mercer with mounting enthusiasm don't you see taylor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5486,8088-284756-0052,if it will work on her and we can direct her thoughts we can find out her history the history of her people we'll add a page to scientific history a whole big chapter that will make us famous man this is so big it's swept me off my feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5487,8088-284756-0053,look and he held out a thin aristocratic brown hand before my eyes a hand that shook with nervous excitement i don't blame you i said quickly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5488,8088-284756-0054,let's get busy what can i do mercer reached around the door into the laboratory and pressed a button for carson he explained we'll need his help in the meantime we'll look over the set up the apparatus is strewn all over the place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5489,8088-284756-0055,he had not exaggerated the set up consisted of a whole bank of tubes each one in its own shielding copper box on a much drilled horizontal panel propped up on insulators were half a score of delicate meters of one kind and another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5490,8088-284756-0056,with thin black fingers that pulsed and trembled behind the panel was a tall cylinder wound with shining copper wire and beside it another panel upright fairly bristling with knobs contact points potentiometers rheostats and switches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5491,8088-284756-0057,and in the center a switch with four contact points a heavy snaky cable led from this panel to the maze of apparatus further on this is the control panel explained mercer the whole affair you understand is in laboratory form,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5492,8088-284756-0058,nothing assembled put the different antennae plug into these jacks like this he picked up a weird hastily built contrivance composed of two semi circular pieces of spring brass crossed at right angles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5493,8088-284756-0059,on all four ends were bright silvery electrodes three of them circular in shape one of them elongated and slightly curved with a quick nervous gesture mercer fitted the thing to his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5494,8088-284756-0060,so that the elongated electrode pressed against the back of his neck extending a few inches down his spine the other three circular electrodes rested on his forehead and either side of his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5495,8088-284756-0061,some ten feet in length ending in a simple switchboard plug which mercer fitted into the uppermost of the three jacks now he directed you put on this one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5496,8088-284756-0062,he adjusted a second contrivance upon my head smiling as i shrank from the contact of the cold metal on my skin and think he moved the switch from the position marked off to the second contact point watching me intently his dark eyes gleaming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5497,8088-284756-0063,very nice old chap carson impressive even in his bathing suit mercer was mighty lucky to have a man like carson something seemed to tick suddenly somewhere deep in my consciousness yes that's very true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5498,8088-284756-0064,the words were not spoken i did not hear them i knew them what i glanced at mercer and he laughed aloud with pleasure and excitement it worked he cried,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5499,8088-284756-0065,i received your thought regarding carson and then turned the switch so that you received my thought and you did rather gingerly i removed the thing from my head and laid it on the table it's wizardry mercer if it will work as well on her it will i know it will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5500,8088-284756-0066,if we can get her to wear one of these replied mercer confidently i have only three of them i had planned some three cornered experiments with you carson and myself we'll leave carson out of to night's experiment however for we'll need him to operate this switch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5501,8088-284756-0067,the other two receive when the switch is on the first contact number one sends and numbers two and three receive when the switch is on number two then he sends thoughts and numbers one and three receive them and so on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5502,8088-284756-0068,i'll lengthen these leads so that we can run them out into the pool and then we'll be ready somehow we must induce her to wear one of these things even if we have to use force i'm sure the three of us can handle her we should be able to i smiled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5503,8088-284756-0069,she was such a slim graceful almost delicate little thing the thought that three strong men might not be able to control her seemed almost amusing you haven't seen her in action yet said mercer grimly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5504,8088-284756-0070,then with all three of the devices he called antennae in his hand their leads plugged into the control panel he led the way to the side of the pool,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5505,8088-284756-0071,it was the first time i had seen her move in this fashion she seemed to propel herself with a sudden mighty thrust of her feet against the bottom she darted through the water with the speed of an arrow yet stopped as gently as though she had merely floated there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5506,8088-284756-0072,as she looked up her eyes unmistakably sought mine and her smile seemed warm and inviting she made again that strange little gesture of invitation with an effort i glanced at mercer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5507,8088-284756-0073,there was something devilishly fascinating about the girl's great dark searching eyes i'm going in i said hoarsely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5508,8088-284756-0074,i headed directly towards the heavy bronze ladder that led to the bottom of the pool i had two reasons in mind i would need something to keep me under water with my lungs full of air and i could get out quickly if it were necessary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5509,8088-284756-0075,i had not forgotten the livid jagged furrows in mercer's side quickly as i shot to the ladder she was there before me a dim wavering white shape waiting i paused holding to a rung of the ladder with one hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5510,8088-284756-0076,she came closer walking with the airy grace i had noted before and my heart pounded against my ribs as she raised one long slim arm towards me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5511,8088-284756-0077,perhaps i thought quickly this was with her a sign of greeting i lifted my own arm and returned the salutation if salutation it were aware of a strange rising and falling sound as of a distant humming in my ears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5512,8088-284756-0078,the sound ceased suddenly on a rising note as though of inquiry and it dawned on me that i had heard the speech of this strange creature before i could think of a course of action my aching lungs reminded me of the need of air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5513,8088-284756-0079,and i released my hold on the ladder and let my body rise to the surface,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5514,8088-284756-0080,i looked down the girl was watching me and there was no smile on her face now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5515,8088-284756-0081,as her face came close to my own i became aware of the humming crooning sound i had heard before louder this time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5516,8088-284756-0082,i smiled back at her and shook my head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5517,8088-284756-0083,i pointed upward for i was feeling the need for fresh air again and slowly mounted the ladder this time she did not grasp me but watched me intently as though understanding what i did and the reasons for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5518,8088-284756-0084,bring one of your gadgets over here mercer i called across the pool i think i'm making progress good boy he cried and came running with two of the antennae the long insulated cords trailing behind him through the water the girl watched him evident dislike in her eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5519,8088-284756-0085,the salt water would short the antennae you see try to get her to wear one and then you get your head out of water and don yours and remember she won't be able to communicate with us by words we'll have to get her to convey her thoughts by means of mental pictures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5520,8088-284756-0086,i'll try to impress that on her understand i nodded and picked up one of the instruments fire when ready gridley i commented and sank again to the bottom of the pool i touched the girl's head with one finger and then pointed to my own head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5521,8088-284756-0087,trying to convey to her that she could get her thoughts to me then i held up the antennae and placed it on my own head to show that it could not harm her my next move was to offer her the instrument moving slowly and smiling reassuringly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5522,8088-284756-0088,no mean feat under water she hesitated a moment and then her eyes fixed on mine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5523,8088-284756-0089,i smiled and nodded and pressed her shoulder in token of friendly greeting then gesturing toward my own head again and pointing upward i climbed the ladder all right mercer i shouted start at once before she grows restless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5524,8088-284756-0090,i've already started he called back and i hurriedly donned my own instrument,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5525,8088-284756-0091,so that my head remained out of water and smiled down at the girl touching the instrument on my head and then pointing to hers i could sense mercer's thoughts now he was picturing himself walking long the shore with the stormy ocean in the background,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5526,8088-284756-0092,i saw him run up to the pool and lift the slim pale figure in his arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5527,8088-284756-0093,i visualized them just as i could close my eyes and visualize for example the fireplace in the living room of my own home i looked down at the girl she was frowning and her eyes were very wide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5528,8088-284756-0094,her head was a little on one side in the attitude of one who listens intently slowly and carefully mercer thought out the whole story of his experiences with the girl until she had plunged into the pool then i saw again the beach,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5529,8088-284756-0095,i was aware of the soft little tick in the center of my brain that announced that the switch had been moved to another contact point i glanced down at her she was staring up at me with her great curious eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5530,8088-284756-0096,and i sensed through the medium of the instrument i wore that she was thinking of me i saw my own features idealized glowing with a strange beauty that was certainly none of my own i realized that i saw myself in short as she saw me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5531,8088-284756-0097,a dim bluish light filtered down on a scene such as mortal eyes have never seen all around were strange structures of jagged coral roughly circular as to base and rounded on top resembling very much the igloos of the eskimos,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5532,8088-284756-0098,the structures varied greatly in size and seemed to be arranged in some sort of regular order like houses along a narrow street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5533,8088-284756-0099,around many of them grew clusters of strange and colorful seaweeds that waved their banners gently as though some imperceptible current dallied with them in passing here and there figures moved slim white figures that strolled along the narrow street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5534,8088-284756-0100,or at times shot overhead like veritable torpedoes there were both men and women moving there the men were broader of shoulder and their hair which they wore to their knees was somewhat darker in color than that of the women both sexes were slim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5535,8088-284756-0101,and there was a remarkable uniformity of size and appearance none of the strange beings wore garments of any kind nor were they necessary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5536,8088-284756-0102,the clinging tresses were cinctured at the waist with a sort of cord of twisted orange colored material and some of the younger women wore bands of the same material around their brows nearest of all the figures was the girl who was visualizing all this for us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5537,8088-284756-0103,she was walking slowly away from the cluster of coral structures once or twice she paused and seemed to hold conversation with others of the strange people but each time she moved on the coral structures grew smaller and poorer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5538,8088-284756-0104,finally the girl trod alone on the floor of the ocean between great growths of kelp and seaweeds with dim looming masses of faintly tinted coral everywhere once she passed close to a tilted ragged hulk of some ancient vessel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5539,8088-284756-0105,its naked ribs packed with drifted sand sauntering dreamily she moved away from the ancient derelict suddenly a dim shadow swept across the sand at her feet and she arrowed from the spot like a white slim meteor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5540,8088-284756-0106,but behind her darted a black and swifter shadow a shark like a flash she turned and faced the monster something she had drawn from her girdle shone palely in her hand it was a knife of whetted stone or bone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5541,8088-284756-0107,the white figure of the girl shot onward through the scarlet flood blinded she did not see that the jutting ribs of the ancient ship were in her path i seemed to see her crash head on into one of the massive timbers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5542,8088-284756-0108,and i cried out involuntarily and glanced down at the girl in the water at my feet her eyes were glowing she knew that i had understood hazily then i seemed to visualize her body floating limply in the water it was all very vague and indistinct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5543,8088-284756-0109,the girl was thinking of her suffering taken out of her native element,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5544,8088-284756-0110,that no doubt was why she hated him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5545,8088-284756-0111,adjusted to her own ideas of what a man should be i flung the instrument from my head and dropped to the bottom of the pool i gripped both her shoulders gently to express my thanks and friendship my heart was pounding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5546,8088-284756-0112,there was a strange fascination about this girl from the depths of the sea a subtle appeal that was answered from some deep subterranean cavern of my being i forgot for the moment who and what i was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5547,8088-284756-0113,her great weirdly blue eyes seemed to bore into my brain i could feel them throbbing there i forgot time and space i saw only that pale smiling face and those great dark eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5548,8088-284756-0114,then strangling i tore myself from her embrace and shot to the surface coughing i cleared my lungs of the water i had inhaled i was weak and shaking when i finished but my head was clear the grip of the strange fantasy that had gripped me was shaken off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5549,8088-284756-0115,mercer was bending over me speaking softly i was watching old man he said gently i can imagine what happened a momentary psychic fusing of an ancient long since broken link you together with all mankind came up out of the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5550,8088-284756-0116,but there is no retracing the way i nodded my head bowed on my streaming chest sorry mercer i muttered something got into me those big eyes of hers seemed to tug at threads of memory buried i can't describe it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5551,8088-284756-0117,it helped jerk me back to the normal you've got your feet on the ground again taylor he commented soothingly i think there's no danger of you losing your grip on terra firma again shall we carry on there's more you'd like to learn that you think she can give us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5552,8088-284756-0118,i asked hesitantly i believe replied mercer that she can give us the history of her people if we can only make her understand what we wish god if we only could,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5553,8088-284756-0119,we can try old timer i said a bit shakenly mercer hurried back to the other side of the pool and i adjusted my head set again smiling down at the girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5554,8051-295385-0000,and his gallant achievements on the delaware chapter one hitherto most venerable and courteous reader have i shown thee the administration of the valorous stuyvesant under the mild moonshine of peace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5555,8051-295385-0001,or rather the grim tranquillity of awful expectation but now the war drum rumbles from afar the brazen trumpet brays its thrilling note,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5556,8051-295385-0002,and the rude clash of hostile arms speaks fearful prophecies of coming troubles the gallant warrior starts from soft repose from golden visions and voluptuous ease where in the dulcet piping time of peace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5557,8051-295385-0003,nor through the livelong lazy summer's day chants forth his love sick soul in madrigals to manhood roused he spurns the amorous flute doffs from his brawny back the robe of peace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5558,8051-295385-0004,and clothes his pampered limbs in panoply of steel o'er his dark brow where late the myrtle waved where wanton roses breathed enervate love he rears the beaming casque and nodding plume grasps the bright shield,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5559,8051-295385-0005,existed in the city of new amsterdam this is but a lofty and gigantic mode in which we heroic writers always talk of war thereby to give it a noble and imposing aspect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5560,8051-295385-0006,equipping our warriors with bucklers helms and lances and such like outlandish and obsolete weapons the like of which perchance they had never seen or heard of in the same manner that a cunning statuary arrays a modern general or an admiral,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5561,8051-295385-0007,in the accoutrements of a caesar or an alexander the simple truth then of all this oratorical flourish is this that the valiant peter stuyvesant all of a sudden found it necessary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5562,8051-295385-0008,and prepare himself to undergo those hardy toils of war in which his mighty soul so much delighted methinks i at this moment behold him in my imagination or rather i behold his goodly portrait,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5563,8051-295385-0009,which still hangs in the family mansion of the stuyvesants arrayed in all the terrors of a true dutch general his regimental coat of german blue gorgeously decorated with a goodly show of large brass buttons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5564,8051-295385-0010,reaching from his waistband to his chin the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners and separating gallantly behind so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone colored trunk breeches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5565,8051-295385-0011,a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our day and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes who scorned to defend themselves in rear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5566,8051-295385-0012,stuck with a gallant and fiery air over his left eye such was the chivalric port of peter the headstrong and when he made a sudden halt planted himself firmly on his solid supporter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5567,8051-295385-0013,with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in advance in order to strengthen his position his right hand grasping a gold headed cane his left resting upon the pummel of his sword his head dressing spiritedly to the right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5568,8051-295385-0014,with a most appalling and hard favored frown upon his brow he presented altogether one of the most commanding bitter looking and soldier like figures that ever strutted upon canvas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5569,8051-295385-0015,proceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation in the preceding chapter we have spoken of the founding of fort casimir and of the merciless warfare waged by its commander,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5570,8051-295385-0016,upon cabbages sunflowers and pumpkins for want of better occasion to flesh his sword now it came to pass that higher up the delaware at his stronghold of tinnekonk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5571,8051-295385-0017,who styled himself governor of new sweden if history belie not this redoubtable swede he was a rival worthy of the windy and inflated commander of fort casimir for master david pieterzen de vrie in his excellent book of voyages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5572,8051-295385-0018,describes him as weighing upwards of four hundred pounds a huge feeder and bouser in proportion taking three potations pottle deep at every meal he had a garrison after his own heart at tinnekonk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5573,8051-295385-0019,guzzling deep drinking swashbucklers who made the wild woods ring with their carousals no sooner did this robustious commander hear of the erection of fort casimir than he sent a message to van poffenburgh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5574,8051-295385-0020,warning him off the land as being within the bounds of his jurisdiction to this general van poffenburgh replied that the land belonged to their high mightinesses having been regularly purchased of the natives as discoverers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5575,8051-295385-0021,from the manhattoes as witness the breeches of their land measurer ten broeck to this the governor rejoined that the land had previously been sold by the indians to the swedes and consequently was under the petticoat government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5576,8051-295385-0022,of her swedish majesty christina and woe be to any mortal that wore a breeches who should dare to meddle even with the hem of her sacred garment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5577,8051-295385-0023,i forbear to dilate upon the war of words which was kept up for some time by these windy commanders van poffenburgh however had served under william the testy and was a veteran in this kind of warfare,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5578,8051-295385-0024,governor printz finding he was not to be dislodged by these long shots now determined upon coming to closer quarters accordingly he descended the river in great force and fume and erected a rival fortress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5579,8051-295385-0025,just one swedish mile below fort casimir to which he gave the name of helsenburg and now commenced a tremendous rivalry between these two doughty commanders striving to outstrut and outswell each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5580,8051-295385-0026,like a couple of belligerent turkey cocks there was a contest who should run up the tallest flag staff and display the broadest flag all day long there was a furious rolling of drums and twanging of trumpets in either fortress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5581,8051-295385-0027,and whichever had the wind in its favor would keep up a continual firing of cannon to taunt its antagonist with the smell of gunpowder on all these points of windy warfare the antagonists were well matched,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5582,8051-295385-0028,but so it happened that the swedish fortress being lower down the river all the dutch vessels bound to fort casimir with supplies had to pass it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5583,8051-295385-0029,governor printz at once took advantage of this circumstance and compelled them to lower their flags as they passed under the guns of his battery this was a deadly wound to the dutch pride of general van poffenburgh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5584,8051-295385-0030,and sorely would he swell when from the ramparts of fort casimir he beheld the flag of their high mightinesses struck to the rival fortress to heighten his vexation governor printz who as has been shown was a huge trencherman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5585,8051-295385-0031,it is possible he may have paid to the dutch skippers the full value of their commodities but what consolation was this to jacobus van poffenburgh and his garrison who thus found their favorite supplies cut off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5586,8051-295385-0032,and diverted into the larders of the hostile camps for some time this war of the cupboard was carried on to the great festivity and jollification of the swedes while the warriors of fort casimir found their hearts or rather their stomachs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5587,8051-295385-0033,daily failing them at length the summer heats and summer showers set in and now lo and behold a great miracle was wrought for the relief of the nederlands,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5588,8051-295385-0034,for it came to pass that a great cloud of mosquitos arose out of the marshy borders of the river and settled upon the fortress of helsenburg being doubtless attracted by the scent of the fresh blood of the swedish gormandisers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5589,8051-295385-0035,nay it is said that the body of jan printz alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5699,6880-216547-0029,instead of confining one to common places without breadth or significance it seems to me that your question should be developed as follows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5711,6880-216547-0041,it was my duty this blame results from the facts which i call attention to why has the church decreed concerning things which it does not understand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5712,6880-216547-0042,the church has erred in dogma and in morals physics and mathematics testify against her it may be wrong for me to say it but surely it is unfortunate for christianity that it is true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5716,6880-216547-0046,in a society like ours to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism of what use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of birth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5718,6880-216547-0048,i no longer aspire to this sad success why should i not confess it gentlemen i have aspired to your suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner hating all which exists and full of projects for its destruction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5719,6880-216547-0049,and the most precious fruit that i could wish to gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and its cause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5720,6880-216547-0050,and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm my hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded perhaps at times i have been guilty in my indignation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5723,6880-216547-0053,and what they ought to fear the people incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas provided that in them they get a taste of flattery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5724,6880-216547-0054,to them the laws of thought are like the confines of the possible to day they can no more distinguish between a savant and a sophist than formerly they could tell a physician from a sorcerer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5729,6880-216547-0059,two months after the receipt of this letter the academy in its debate of august twenty fourth replied to the address of its pensioner by a note the text of which i give below,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5730,6880-216547-0060,published last june by the titulary of the suard pension entitled what is property and dedicated by the author to the academy he is of the opinion that the society owes it to justice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5731,6880-216547-0061,to example and to its own dignity to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti social doctrines contained in this publication in consequence he demands,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5732,6880-216547-0062,in the most formal manner the work of the suard pensioner as having been published without its assent and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5733,6880-216547-0063,in case he should publish a second edition of his book to omit the dedication,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5734,6880-216547-0064,that this judgment of the academy be placed upon the records these three propositions put to vote are adopted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5735,6880-216547-0065,after this ludicrous decree which its authors thought to render powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5736,6880-216547-0066,i can only beg the reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our academy while my patrons in the social and political sciences were fulminating anathemas against my brochure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5737,6880-216547-0067,who did not know me who might even have regarded himself as personally attacked by the too sharp judgment which i had passed upon the economists a publicist as learned as he was modest loved by the people whose sorrows he felt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5738,6880-216547-0068,honored by the power which he sought to enlighten without flattering or disgracing it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5740,6880-216547-0070,and saved me from the blows of a justice which is always blind because it is always ignorant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5741,6880-216547-0071,a letter as honorable to its author as it is flattering to him to whom it is addressed paris may first eighteen forty one monsieur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5742,6880-216547-0072,i hasten to thank you for forwarding to me your second memoir upon property i have read it with all the interest that an acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire i am very glad that you have modified somewhat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5743,6880-216547-0073,the rudeness of form which gave to a work of such gravity the manner and appearance of a pamphlet for you quite frightened me sir and your talent was needed to reassure me in regard to your intentions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5744,6880-216547-0074,this proposition now coming into notice property is robbery was of a nature to repel from your book even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances had you persisted in maintaining it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5745,6880-216547-0075,in its rude simplicity but if you have softened the form you are none the less faithful to the ground work of your doctrines and although you have done me the honor to give me a share in this perilous teaching,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5746,6880-216547-0076,i cannot accept a partnership which as far as talent goes would surely be a credit to me but which would compromise me in all other respects i agree with you in one thing only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5747,6880-216547-0077,namely that all kinds of property get too frequently abused in this world but i do not reason from the abuse to the abolition an heroic remedy too much like death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5748,6880-216547-0078,which cures all evils i will go farther i will confess that of all abuses the most hateful to me are those of property but once more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5749,6880-216547-0079,there is a remedy for this evil without violating it all the more without destroying it if the present laws allow abuse we can reconstruct them our civil code is not the koran,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5750,6880-216547-0080,it is not wrong to examine it change then the laws which govern the use of property but be sparing of anathemas for logically where is the honest man whose hands are entirely clean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5751,6880-216547-0081,do you think that one can be a robber without knowing it without wishing it without suspecting it do you not admit that society in its present state like every man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5752,6880-216547-0082,has in its constitution all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors is property then in your eyes a thing so simple and so abstract that you can re knead and equalize it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5753,6880-216547-0083,if i may so speak in your metaphysical mill one who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur in these two beautiful and paradoxical improvisations of yours cannot be a pure and unwavering utopist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5754,6880-216547-0084,you are too well acquainted with the economical and academical phraseology to play with the hard words of revolutions i believe then that you have handled property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5755,6880-216547-0085,as rousseau eighty years ago handled letters with a magnificent and poetical display of wit and knowledge such at least is my opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5756,6880-216547-0086,that is what i said to the institute at the time when i presented my report upon your book i knew that they wished to proceed against you in the courts you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance i succeeded in preventing them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5757,6880-216547-0087,what chagrin i should always have felt if the king's counsel that is to say the intellectual executioner had followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5758,6880-216547-0088,i actually passed two terrible nights and i succeeded in restraining the secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical dissertation and not the manifesto of an incendiary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5759,6880-216547-0089,your style is too lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest questions of our social order use paving stones as their weapons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5760,6880-216547-0090,but see to it sir that ere long they do not come in spite of you to seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal and that your vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophist of the market place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5761,6880-216547-0091,who might discuss the question in the presence of a starving audience we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5762,6880-216547-0092,but the majestic and imposing order of human societies that i sometimes find myself embarrassed in attacking certain abuses i like to rebuild with one hand when i am compelled to destroy with the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5763,6880-216547-0093,in pruning an old tree we guard against destruction of the buds and fruit you know that as well as any one you are a wise and learned man you have a thoughtful mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5764,6880-216547-0094,the terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are strong enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your intentions but you conclude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5765,6880-216547-0095,in favor of the abolition of property you wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind you attack the paternal sentiment in its sweetest illusions with one word you arrest the formation of capital,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5766,6880-216547-0096,and we build henceforth upon the sand instead of on a rock that i cannot agree to and for that reason i have criticised your book so full of beautiful pages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5767,6880-216547-0097,so brilliant with knowledge and fervor i wish sir that my impaired health would permit me to examine with you page by page the memoir which you have done me the honor to address to me publicly and personally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5768,6880-216547-0098,i desire also the merit of prudence you know how deep seated is the disease under which the working people are suffering i know how many noble hearts beat under those rude garments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5769,6880-216547-0099,who rise early in the morning to labor to pay their taxes and to make our country strong i try to serve and enlighten them whereas some endeavor to mislead them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5770,6880-216547-0100,you have not written directly for them you have issued two magnificent manifestoes the second more guarded than the first issue a third more guarded than the second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5771,6880-216547-0101,and you will take high rank in science whose first precept is calmness and impartiality farewell sir no man's esteem for another can exceed mine for you blanqui,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5772,6880-216547-0102,i should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent letter but i confess that i am more inclined to realize the prediction with which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of my antagonists,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5773,6880-216547-0103,so much controversy fatigues and wearies me the intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in battle it is intelligence wasted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5774,6880-216547-0104,i call property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5775,6880-216547-0105,to each of us property seems a polygon whose angles need knocking off but the operation performed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5776,6880-216547-0106,an hypothesis admitted in mathematics although not proven while i consider that this figure will be a circle honest people can at least understand one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5777,6880-216547-0107,for the rest i allow that in the present state of the question the mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition of property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5778,6880-216547-0108,to gain the victory for one's cause it does not suffice simply to overthrow a principle generally recognized which has the indisputable merit of systematically recapitulating our political theories,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5779,6880-216547-0109,it is also necessary to establish the opposite principle and to formulate the system which must proceed from it still further it is necessary to show the method by which the new system,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5780,6880-216547-0110,will satisfy all the moral and political needs which induced the establishment of the first on the following conditions then of subsequent evidence depends the correctness of my preceding arguments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5781,6880-216547-0111,the discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing institutions save property or the sum of the abuses of property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5782,6880-216547-0112,not only may find a place but may themselves serve as instruments of equality individual liberty the division of power the public ministry the jury system,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5783,6880-216547-0113,administrative and judicial organization the unity and completeness of instruction marriage the family heredity in direct and collateral succession the right of sale and exchange the right to make a will and even birthright,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5784,6880-216547-0114,a system which better than property guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage of all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5785,6880-216547-0115,the road that he shall traverse will suffice to show the end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5786,911-130578-0000,and for this the village boys with whom he played used to quarrel with him saying fatherless orphan why do you cheat so one day he asked his mother why they called him that name and whether his father was really dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5787,911-130578-0001,he is alive said she but a long time ago a rhinoceros carried him off on its horn then the boy vowed that he would go in search of his father and made his mother put him up provisions for the journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5788,911-130578-0002,and he started off taking with him an iron bow and a big bundle of arrows he journeyed on all day and at nightfall he came to a village there he went up to the house of an old woman to ask for a bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5789,911-130578-0003,grannie grannie open the door i have no son and no grandchildren to call me grannie grumbled the old woman and went to open the door to see who was there and when she opened the door and saw him she said ho,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5790,911-130578-0004,you are my grandson yes answered he i am your grandchild so she called him inside and gave him a bed to sleep on the old woman was called hutibudi,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5791,911-130578-0005,and she and the boy sat up late talking together and then they lay down to sleep but in the middle of the night he heard the old woman crunching away trying to bite his bow to pieces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5792,911-130578-0006,he asked her what she was eating some pulse i got from the village headman give me a little to try he begged i am sorry my child i have finished it all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5793,911-130578-0007,but really she had none to give however she only hurt her jaws biting so that she began to groan with pain what are you groaning for grannie said the boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5794,911-130578-0008,and in truth her cheeks were badly swollen then he told her that a good cure for toothache was to bite on a white stone and she believed him and the next morning got a piece of white quartz and began to bite on it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5795,911-130578-0009,but this only broke her teeth and made her mouth bleed so that the pain was worse than before then the boy jeered at her and said did you think grannie that you could bite my iron bow and arrows so saying he left her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5796,911-130578-0010,and continued the search for his father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5797,911-130578-0011,he came to a lake and he sat down by it to eat what was left of the provisions he had brought as he sat he suddenly saw some cow bison coming down to the lake at this he caught up his bow and arrows in a hurry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5798,911-130578-0012,and climbed up a tall sal tree from the tree he watched the bison go down to the water to drink and then go back into the jungle and after them tigers and bears came down to the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5799,911-130578-0013,the sight of them frightened him and he sang drink your fill tiger i shall not shoot you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5800,911-130578-0014,and they drank and went away then various kinds of birds came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5801,911-130578-0015,and among them was one which had the dried up body of the boy's father stuck on its horn the boy was rather frightened and sang,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5802,911-130578-0016,he put an arrow through it and it turned a somersault and fell over dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5803,911-130578-0017,and ran away then the boy climbed down from the tree and pulled the dead body of his father off the horn of the dead animal and laid it down at the foot of a tree and began to weep over it as he wept,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5804,911-130578-0018,a man suddenly stood before him and asked what was the matter and when he heard said cry no more take a cloth and wet it in the lake and cover your father's body with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5805,911-130578-0019,and then whip the body with a meral twig and he will come to life so saying the stranger suddenly disappeared and the boy obeyed his instructions and behold his father sat up alive and rubbing his eyes said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5806,911-130578-0020,i must have been asleep a very long time then his son explained to him all that had happened and gave him some food,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5807,911-128684-0000,are as dualistic as it is possible to be thoughts we all naturally think are made of one kind of substance and things of another consciousness flowing inside of us in the forms of conception or judgment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5808,911-128684-0001,or concentrating itself in the shape of passion or emotion can be directly felt as the spiritual activity which it is and known in contrast with the space filling objective content which it envelopes and accompanies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5809,911-128684-0002,in opposition to this dualistic philosophy i tried in the first essay to show that thoughts and things are absolutely homogeneous as to their material and that their opposition is only one of relation and of function,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5810,911-128684-0003,there is no thought stuff different from thing stuff i said but the same identical piece of pure experience which was the name i gave to the materia prima of everything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5811,911-128684-0004,can stand alternately for a fact of consciousness or for a physical reality according as it is taken in one context or in another for the right understanding of what follows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5812,911-128684-0005,in our pleasures and pains our loves and fears and angers in the beauty comicality importance or preciousness of certain objects and situations we have i am told by many critics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5813,911-128684-0006,a great realm of experience intuitively recognized as spiritual made and felt to be made of consciousness exclusively and different in nature from the space filling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5814,911-128684-0007,because i had to be so brief i now return to the subject because i believe that so far from invalidating my general thesis these phenomena when properly analyzed afford it powerful support,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5815,911-128684-0008,the central point of the pure experience theory is that outer and inner are names for two groups into which we sort experiences according to the way in which they act upon their neighbors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5816,911-128684-0009,any one content such as hard let us say can be assigned to either group in the outer group it is strong it acts energetically and aggressively,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5817,911-128684-0010,here whatever is hard interferes with the space its neighbors occupy it dents them is impenetrable by them and we call the hardness then a physical hardness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5818,911-128684-0011,in the mind on the contrary the hard thing is nowhere in particular it dents nothing it suffuses through its mental neighbors as it were and interpenetrates them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5819,911-128684-0012,taken in this group we call both it and them ideas or sensations and the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of interrelation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5820,911-128684-0013,the mutual impenetrability on the one hand and the lack of physical interference and interaction on the other that what in itself is one and the same entity should be able to function thus differently in different contexts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5821,911-128684-0014,is a natural consequence of the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come to her offspring a tigress is tender but cruel to every other living thing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5822,911-128684-0015,both cruel and tender therefore at once a mass in movement resists every force that operates contrariwise to its own direction but to forces that pursue the same direction or come in at right angles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5823,911-128684-0016,it is absolutely inert it is thus both energetic and inert and the same is true if you vary the associates properly of every other piece of experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5824,911-128684-0017,it is only towards certain specific groups of associates that the physical energies as we call them of a content are put forth in another group it may be quite inert,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5825,911-128684-0018,it is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only alternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or complete inertness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5826,911-128684-0019,in such a world the mental or the physical status of any piece of experience would be unequivocal when active it would figure in the physical and when inactive in the mental group,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5827,911-128684-0020,but the universe we live in is more chaotic than this and there is room in it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences of our emotions and appreciative perceptions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5828,911-128684-0021,in the paragraphs that follow i shall try to show one that the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given as purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous and two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5829,911-128684-0022,that their ambiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that subjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is aboriginally made of but of its classification,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5830,911-128684-0023,classifications depend on our temporary purposes for certain purposes it is convenient to take things in one set of relations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5831,911-128684-0024,in the two cases their contexts are apt to be different in the case of our affectional experiences we have no permanent and steadfast purpose that obliges us to be consistent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5832,911-128684-0025,so we find it easy to let them float ambiguously sometimes classing them with our feelings sometimes with more physical realities according to caprice or to the convenience of the moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5833,911-128684-0026,thus would these experiences so far from being an obstacle to the pure experience philosophy serve as an excellent corroboration of its truth first of all then it is a mistake to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5834,911-128684-0027,with the objectors whom i began by citing that anger love and fear are affections purely of the mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5835,911-128684-0028,they are simultaneously affections of the body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5836,911-128684-0029,and we are always free to speak of them in objective as well as in subjective terms we can say that we are aware of a painful place filling a certain bigness in our organism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5837,911-128684-0030,or we can say that we are inwardly in a state of pain all our adjectives of worth are similarly ambiguous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5838,911-128684-0031,or is it a feeling in our mind practically we treat it as both or as either according to the temporary direction of our thought beauty says professor santayana is pleasure objectified,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5839,911-128684-0032,and in sections ten and eleven of his work the sense of beauty he treats in a masterly way of this equivocal realm the various pleasures we receive from an object,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5840,911-128684-0033,may count as feelings when we take them singly but when they combine in a total richness we call the result the beauty of the object and treat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5841,911-128684-0034,we discover beauty just as we discover the physical properties of things training is needed to make us expert in either line single sensations also may be ambiguous shall we say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5861,911-128684-0054,actively efficacious as they seem to be we ourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us and until more purely intellectual as distinguished from practical needs had arisen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5862,911-128684-0055,no one ever thought of calling these qualities subjective when however galileo descartes and others found it best for philosophic purposes to class sound heat and light along with pain and pleasure as purely mental phenomena,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5863,911-128684-0056,hardness and softness are effects on us of atomic interactions and the atoms themselves are neither hard nor soft nor solid nor liquid size and shape are deemed subjective by kantians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5864,911-128684-0057,are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena of our own consciousness there are no activities or effects in nature for the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5865,911-128684-0058,nature exhibits only changes which habitually coincide with one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5866,911-128684-0059,but only a translocation of experiences from one world to another a grouping of them with one set or another of associates for definitely practical or intellectual ends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5867,911-128684-0060,i will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of relations they are undeniable parts of pure experience yet while common sense and what i call radical empiricism stand for their being objective,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5868,911-128684-0061,both rationalism and the usual empiricism claim that they are exclusively the work of the mind' the finite mind or the absolute mind as the case may be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5869,911-128684-0062,turn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us we soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our interests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5870,911-128684-0063,it does not work to assume that physical objects are going to act outwardly by their sympathetic or antipathetic qualities the beauty of a thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon of compositions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5872,911-128684-0065,its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands of physical nature chemical affinities are a purely verbal metaphor and as i just said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5873,911-128684-0066,even such things as forces tensions and activities can at a pinch be regarded as anthropomorphic projections so far then as the physical world means the collection of contents that determine in each other certain regular changes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5874,911-128684-0067,the whole collection of our appreciative attributes has to be treated as falling outside of it if we mean by physical nature whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5875,911-128684-0068,why then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do and not class them decisively as purely spiritual the reason would seem to be that although they are inert as regards the rest of physical nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5876,911-128684-0069,they are not inert as regards that part of physical nature which our own skin covers it is those very appreciative attributes of things their dangerousness beauty rarity utility et cetera,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5877,911-128684-0070,that primarily appeal to our attention in our commerce with nature these attributes are what give emphasis to objects and for an object to be emphatic whatever spiritual fact it may mean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5878,911-128684-0071,means also that it produces immediate bodily effects upon us alterations of tone and tension of heart beat and breathing of vascular and visceral action,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5879,911-128684-0072,the interesting aspects of things are thus not wholly inert physically though they be active only in these small corners of physical nature which our bodies occupy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5880,911-128684-0073,that however is enough to save them from being classed as absolutely non objective the attempt if any one should make it to sort experiences into two absolutely discrete groups,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5881,911-128684-0074,with nothing but inertness in one of them and nothing but activities in the other would thus receive one check it would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively mental group,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5882,911-128684-0075,for though in that group it be true that things do not act on one another by their physical properties do not dent each other or set fire to each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5883,911-128684-0076,they yet act on each other in the most energetic way by those very characters which are so inert extracorporeally it is by the interest and importance that experiences have for us by the emotions they excite,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5884,911-128684-0077,and the purposes they subserve by their affective values in short that their consecution in our several conscious streams as thoughts of ours is mainly ruled desire introduces them interest holds them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5885,911-128684-0078,fitness fixes their order and connection i need only refer for this aspect of our mental life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5886,911-128684-0079,is the most natural thing in the world it would however be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which i cited at the outset were correct if physical and mental meant two different kinds of intrinsic nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5887,911-128684-0080,immediately intuitively and infallibly discernible and each fixed forever in whatever bit of experience it qualified one does not see how there could ever have arisen any room for doubt or ambiguity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5888,911-128684-0081,but if on the contrary these words are words of sorting ambiguity is natural for then as soon as the relations of a thing are sufficiently various it can be sorted variously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5889,911-128684-0082,take a mass of carrion for example,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5890,911-128684-0083,the sun caresses it and the zephyr wooes it as if it were a bed of roses so the disgustingness fails to operate within the realm of suns and breezes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5891,911-128684-0084,it does not function as a physical quality but the carrion turns our stomach by what seems a direct operation it does function physically therefore in that limited part of physics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5892,911-128684-0085,and conversely of course we must treat it as non mental or as mental our body itself is the palmary instance of the ambiguous sometimes i treat my body purely as a part of outer nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5893,911-128684-0086,sometimes again i think of it as mine i sort it with the me and then certain local changes and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings its breathing is my thinking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5894,911-128684-0087,its sensorial adjustments are my attention,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5895,911-128684-0088,its visceral perturbations are my emotions the obstinate controversies that have arisen over such statements as these which sound so paradoxical and which can yet be made so seriously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5896,911-128684-0089,prove how hard it is to decide by bare introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either spiritual or material it surely can be nothing intrinsic in the individual experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5897,911-128684-0090,it is their way of behaving towards each other their system of relations their function and all these things vary with the context in which we find it opportune to consider them i think i may conclude then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5898,911-128684-0091,and i hope that my readers are now ready to conclude with me that the pretended spirituality of our emotions and of our attributes of value so far from proving an objection to the philosophy of pure experience does when rightly discussed and accounted for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

5907,8580-287363-0008,though the engine had not yet been speeded up to its limit tom wanted it to warm up first everything all right asked mister damon as tom rejoined them in the pilot house which was just forward of the living room in the main cabin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5908,8580-287363-0009,yes i can't imagine what made rad act that way but i'll set the automatic steering gear now mister damon and then you will be relieved mister jenks was gazing off toward the west,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5909,8580-287363-0010,to where he hoped to discover the secret of phantom mountain how do you like it asked tom it's great replied the diamond man i've never been in an airship before and it's different than what i expected but it's great,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5910,8580-287363-0011,it's the only craft that will serve our purpose among the towering mountain peaks where the diamond makers are hidden i hope we can find them in a little while the red cloud was skimming along at faster speed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5911,8580-287363-0012,guided by the automatic rudders so that no one was needed in the pilot house since there was no danger of collisions airships are not quite numerous enough for that yet though they may soon become so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5912,8580-287363-0013,tom and the others devoted several hours to arranging their staterooms and bunks and getting their clothing stowed away and when this was done mister parker and mister jenks sat gazing off into space it's hard to realize that we are really in an airship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5913,8580-287363-0014,observed the diamond man at first i thought i would be frightened but i'm not a bit it doesn't seem as if anything could happen something is likely to happen soon said mister parker suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5914,8580-287363-0015,as he gazed at some weather instruments on the cabin wall bless my soul don't say that cried mister damon what is it i think from my observations that we will soon have a hurricane said the scientific man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5915,8580-287363-0016,there is every indication of it and he seemed quite delighted at the prospect of his prediction coming true a hurricane cried mister damon i hope it isn't like the one that blew us to earthquake island,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5916,8580-287363-0017,oh i think there will be no danger spoke tom if it comes on to blow we will ascend or descend out of the path of the storm this craft is not like the ill fated whizzer i can more easily handle the red cloud even in a bad storm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5917,8580-287363-0018,remarked mister jenks it would be too bad to be wrecked before we got to phantom mountain well i predict that we will have a bad storm insisted mister parker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5918,8580-287363-0019,and tom could not help wishing that the scientist would keep his gloomy forebodings to himself however the storm had not developed up to noon when tom with mister damon's help served a fine meal in the dining room in the afternoon the speed of the ship was increased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5919,8580-287363-0020,and by night they had covered several hundred miles through the darkness the red cloud kept on making good time tom got up occasionally to look to the machinery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5920,8580-287363-0021,and an alarm bell would sound in his stateroom when anything went wrong bless my napkin exclaimed mister damon the next morning as they sat down to a breakfast of fruit ham and eggs and fragrant coffee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5921,8580-287363-0022,and yet we are how far are we above the earth tom he asked turning to the young inventor about two miles now i just sent her up as i thought i detected that storm mister parker spoke of i told you it would come declared the scientist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5922,8580-287363-0023,that morning but only the lower edge of it caught the red cloud and when tom sent her up still higher she found a comparatively quiet zone where she slid along at good speed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5923,8580-287363-0024,that afternoon tom busied himself about some wires and a number of complicated pieces of apparatus which were in one corner of the main cabin what are you doing now asked mister jenks who had been talking with mister parker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5924,8580-287363-0025,and showing that scientist some of the manufactured diamonds getting our wireless apparatus in shape answered the lad i should have done it before but i had so much to do that i couldn't get at it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5925,8580-287363-0026,dad will want to know how we are doing as he worked away he also made up his mind to send another message in care of his father for there was a receiving station in the swift home and to whom this message was addressed tom did not say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5926,8580-287363-0027,but we fancy some of our readers can guess finally after several hours of work the wireless was in shape to send and receive messages tom pulled over the lever and a crackling sound was heard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5927,8580-287363-0028,as the electricity leaped from the transmitters into space then he clamped the receiver on his ear all ready he announced has anybody any messages they wish sent for with the courtesy of a true host,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5928,8580-287363-0029,he was ready to serve his guests before he forwarded his own wireless notes just tell my wife that i'm enjoying myself requested mister damon bless my footstool but this is great we're off the earth yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5929,8580-287363-0030,connected with it mister jenks had no one to whom he wanted to send any word but mister parker wish to wire to a fellow scientist the result of some observations made in the upper air tom noted all the messages down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5930,8580-287363-0031,and then when all was in readiness he began to call his home station he knew that either his father or mister jackson the engineer could receive the wireless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5931,8580-287363-0032,but no sooner had the young inventor sent off the first few dots and dashes representing s i his home station call than he started and a look of surprise came over his face they're calling us he exclaimed who is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5932,8580-287363-0033,asked mister jenks my house my father he he's been trying to get us ever since we started but i didn't have the wireless in shape to receive messages oh i hope it's not too late too late bless my soul too late for what,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5933,8580-287363-0034,gasped mister damon somewhat alarmed by tom's manner the lad did not answer at once he was intently listening to a series of dots and dashes that clicked in the telephone receiver clamped to his left ear on his face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5934,8580-287363-0035,there was a look of worriment father has just sent me a message he said it's a warning flashed through space he's been trying to get it to me since yesterday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5935,8580-287363-0036,asked mister jenks rising from his seat the mysterious man is aboard the airship hidden away cried tom that's what eradicate was trying to call to our attention as we started off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5936,8580-287364-0000,chapter ten dropping the stowaway tom's excited announcement startled mister damon and the others as much as if the young inventor had informed them that the airship had exploded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5937,8580-287364-0001,and was about to dash with them to the earth the men leaped to their feet and stared at the lad a stowaway on board cried mister damon bless my soul how did he are you sure that message is straight asked mister jenks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5938,8580-287364-0002,did eradicate see the man he says he did answered tom the man is hidden away on board now probably among the stores and supplies bless my tomato sauce exploded mister damon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5939,8580-287364-0003,we must get him out at once declared mister jenks i knew something would happen on this voyage came from mister parker i predicted it from the first tom thought considerable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5940,8580-287364-0004,but he did not answer the scientist just then another communication was coming to him by wireless he listened intently father says the lad told his companions that eradicate only had a glimpse of the man at the last moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5941,8580-287364-0005,he was looking from the rear storeroom window he's the same man who called on me that time rad remembers him very well bless my shoes what's to be done inquired mister damon looking around helplessly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5942,8580-287364-0006,decided mister jenks with vigor get him out and drop him overboard drop him overboard cried mister parker in horror not exactly but get rid of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5943,8580-287364-0007,that man is one of my enemies he has been sent by the band of diamond makers hidden among the mountains to spy on me and if possible prevent me from seeking to discover their secret,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5944,8580-287364-0008,he tried to work on tom's swift's fears and frighten him from using his airship on this quest then when he failed the man must have sneaked into the shed and hidden himself in the ship we must get rid of him or he may wreck the red cloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5945,8580-287364-0009,that's so cried tom we must try to capture him i think we had better the lad paused and again listened to the wireless message father says eradicate saw the man have a gun so we must be careful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5946,8580-287364-0010,the young inventor translated the dots and dashes bless my powder horn exploded mister damon we shall have to proceed cautiously then spoke mister jenks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5947,8580-287364-0011,if he is like any others in the gang he is a desperate man better sneak up on him then if we can proposed mister parker there are enough of us to cope with one man even if he is armed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5948,8580-287364-0012,he inquired of tom yes was the hesitating answer but i don't want to use them if i can help it not only because of the danger and a dislike of shedding blood but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5949,8580-287364-0013,because a stray bullet might pierce the gas bag and damage the ship that's so agreed mister jenks well i guess if we go at it the right way we can capture him without any shooting but we must talk more quietly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5950,8580-287364-0014,he may have heard us i don't think so replied tom the storeroom is far enough off so that he couldn't hear us besides the motor makes such a racket that he couldn't distinguish what we were talking about even if he heard our voices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5951,8580-287364-0015,so unless he heard the wireless working and suspects something from that he probably doesn't know that we are aware of his presence aboard but why do you think he has remained quiet all this while tom asked mister damon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5952,8580-287364-0016,probably he wants to wait until the ship is farther out west suggested mister jenks then he will be nearer his friends and can get help if he needs it and do you really believe he would destroy the red cloud asked mister parker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5953,8580-287364-0017,i think that all he is waiting for is a favorable chance declared the diamond seeker he would destroy the craft and us too if he could prevent us from discovering the secret of phantom mountain i believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5954,8580-287364-0018,then we must get ahead of him decided tom quietly i have just flashed to dad a message telling him that we will heed his warning now to capture the stowaway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5955,8580-287364-0019,and while we're about it give him a good scare when we do get him suggested mister jenks how asked tom threaten to drop him overboard perhaps that will make him tell how he happened to get in our ship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5956,8580-287364-0020,and what are the plans of the gang of diamond makers we may get valuable information that way i don't believe you can scare such fellows much was tom's opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5957,8580-287364-0021,how are you going to capture him asked mister parker if he has a gun it won't be any too easy to go in the storeroom and drag him out we'll have to use a little strategy decided tom and then they discussed several plans,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5958,8580-287364-0022,the one finally adopted was that tom and mister damon should enter the storeroom casually as if in search of food to cook for supper they would discuss various dishes and mister damon was to express a preference for something in the food line,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5959,8580-287364-0023,the box containing which was well back in the room this would give the two a chance to penetrate to the far end of the apartment without arousing the suspicions of the hidden man who doubtless would be listening to the conversation and as soon as we get sight of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5960,8580-287364-0024,said tom jump before he has a chance to use his gun mister jenks and mister parker will be waiting outside the room to catch him if he gets away from us i'll have some ropes ready and we'll tie him up and well we'll decide later what to do with him all right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5961,8580-287364-0025,i'm ready as soon as you are tom said the eccentric man come ahead they went softly to the storeroom and listened at the door there was no sound heard save that made by the machinery i wonder if he's really here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5962,8580-287364-0026,whispered mister damon we'll soon find out answered tom let's go in they entered and in pursuance of their plan tom and his friend talked of various foods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5963,8580-287364-0027,i think i'd like some of that canned lobster with french dressing on spoke the eccentric man that's away in the back end of the room said tom in a loud voice it's under a lot of boxes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5964,8580-287364-0028,then i'll help you get it out bless my frying pan but i am very fond of lobster exclaimed mister damon in as natural tones as was possible under the circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5965,8580-287364-0029,he and tom moved cautiously back among the boxes and barrels they were glancing about with eager eyes tom switched on an electric light and the instant he did so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5966,8580-287364-0030,he was aware of a movement in a little space formed by one box which was placed on top of two others the lad saw a dark figure moving as if to get farther out of sight i've got him cried tom making a dive for the shadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5967,8580-287364-0031,a moment later the young inventor was bowled over as a dark figure leaped over his head catch him mister damon he cried bless my hatband i i mister damon's voice ended in a grunt he too had been knocked down by the fleeing man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5968,8580-287364-0032,look out mister jenks cried tom to warn those on guard at the door of the storeroom there was the report of a gun some excited shouts and when tom could scramble to his feet and rush out he beheld mister parker calmly sitting on a struggling man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5969,8580-287364-0033,while mister jenks held a gun that was still smoking we caught him cried the scientist anybody hurt asked tom anxiously no i knocked up his gun as he fired explained mister jenks where are the ropes tom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5970,8580-287364-0034,the cords were produced and the man who had now ceased to struggle was tightly bound he uttered not a word but he smiled grimly when mister damon remarked i guess i'll go back in the storeroom tom and see how much food he ate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5971,8580-287364-0035,he wasn't there long enough well farley munson so it's you is it asked mister jenks as he surveyed the prisoner do you know him asked tom in some surprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5972,8580-287364-0036,he was in with the diamond makers said mister jenks he was one of those who took me to the secret cave but it will be the last time he ever goes there how high up are we tom about two miles why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5973,8580-287364-0037,i guess that will be far enough to let him fall went on the diamond seeker come on mister damon help me throw him overboard you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5974,8580-287364-0038,throw me over with the airship two miles high are you gasped the man will you tell us what we want to know if we don't asked mister jenks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5975,8580-287364-0039,how you got aboard and what your object was in coming that's easy enough i had been hanging around the shed for several days watching a chance to get in finally i saw it when that colored man went to feed his mule and i slipped in and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5976,8580-287364-0040,hid in the airship the stores were all in then and i stowed myself away among the boxes i had food and water so i didn't touch any of yours and he looked at mister damon who seemed much relieved and what was your object,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5977,8580-287364-0041,demanded mister jenks i wanted to prevent you from going to phantom mountain how by destroying the airship if need be but i hoped to accomplish it by other means,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5978,8580-287364-0042,you must keep away from there and if we refuse asked tom then you'll have to take what comes but not from you exclaimed mister jenks we're going to get rid of you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5979,8580-287364-0043,the man's face showed the alarm he felt oh don't worry said mister jenks quickly we're not going to toss you overboard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5980,8580-287364-0044,and then go on before you can send any word to your confederates we'll put you off in the most lonesome spot we can find and i guess you'll be some time getting back to civilization by that time we'll have the secret of the diamonds you never will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5981,8580-287364-0045,declared the man firmly and he would say nothing more though by threats and promises mister jenks tried to get from him something about the men in with him and where the cave of the diamonds was located,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5982,8580-287364-0046,heavily bound with ropes the man was locked in a small closet to be kept there until a favorable spot was reached for letting him go mister jenks plan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5983,8580-287364-0047,was considered a good one three days later in crossing over a lonely region near the nebraska national forest farley munson which was one of the names the spy went by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5984,8580-287364-0048,was dropped off the airship when it was sent down to within a few feet of the earth it will take you some time to get to a telegraph office said mister jenks as a package of food and a flask of water was tossed down to the stowaway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5985,8580-287364-0049,he shook his fist at those in the airship and shouted after them you'll never discover the secret of phantom mountain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5986,332-128985-0000,we will pass to the consideration of a regular out and out pirate one from whose mast head would have floated the black flag with its skull and cross bones if that emblematic piece of bunting had been in use by the pirates of the period,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5987,332-128985-0001,and his own was unknown and the brazilian because he was born in brazil though of dutch parents unlike most of his fellow practitioners he did not gradually become a pirate from his early youth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5988,332-128985-0002,he never had an intention of being anything else as soon as he grew to be a man he became a bloody buccaneer and at the first opportunity he joined a pirate crew and had made but a few voyages when it was perceived by his companions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5989,332-128985-0003,that he was destined to become a most remarkable sea robber he was offered the command of a ship with a well armed crew of marine savages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5990,332-128985-0004,he fell in with a spanish ship loaded with silver bullion having captured this he sailed with his prize to jamaica which was one of the great resorts of the english buccaneers there his success delighted the community,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5991,332-128985-0005,his talents for the conduct of great piratical operations soon became apparent and he was generally acknowledged as the head pirate of the west indies he was now looked upon as a hero even by those colonists,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5992,332-128985-0006,who had no sympathy with pirates and as for esquemeling he simply worshipped the great brazilian desperado if he had been writing the life and times of alexander the great julius caesar or mister gladstone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5993,332-128985-0007,he could not have been more enthusiastic in his praises and as in the arabian nights the roc is described as the greatest of birds so in the eyes of the buccaneer biographer this roc was the greatest of pirates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5994,332-128985-0008,that roc now became famous the better he became known the more general was the fear and respect felt for him and we are told that the mothers of the islands used to put their children to sleep by threatening them with the terrible roc if they did not close their eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5995,332-128985-0009,this story however i regard with a great deal of doubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5996,332-128985-0010,but i do not believe it is an easy thing to frighten a child into going to sleep if i found it necessary to make a youngster take a nap i should say nothing of the condition of affairs in cuba or of the persecutions of the armenians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5997,332-128985-0011,this renowned pirate from brazil must have been a terrible fellow to look at he was strong and brawny his face was short and very wide with high cheek bones and his expression probably resembled that of a pug dog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5998,332-128985-0012,his eyebrows were enormously large and bushy and from under them he glared at his mundane surroundings he was not a man whose spirit could be quelled by looking him steadfastly in the eye it was his custom in the daytime to walk about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
5999,332-128985-0013,carrying a drawn cutlass resting easily upon his arm edge up very much as a fine gentleman carries his high silk hat and any one who should impertinently stare or endeavor to quell his high spirits in any other way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6000,332-128985-0014,would probably have felt the edge of that cutlass descending rapidly through his physical organism he was a man who insisted upon being obeyed and if any one of his crew behaved improperly or was even found idle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6001,332-128985-0015,but although he was so strict and exacting during the business sessions of his piratical year by which i mean when he was cruising around after prizes he was very much more disagreeable when he was taking a vacation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6002,332-128985-0016,on his return to jamaica after one of his expeditions it was his habit to give himself some relaxation after the hardships and dangers through which he had passed and on such occasions it was a great comfort to roc to get himself thoroughly drunk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6003,332-128985-0017,with his cutlass waving high in the air he would rush out into the street and take a whack at every one whom he met as far as was possible the citizens allowed him to have the street to himself and it was not at all likely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6004,332-128985-0018,that his visits to jamaica were looked forward to with any eager anticipations roc it may be said was not only a bloody pirate but a blooded one he was thoroughbred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6005,332-128985-0019,from the time he had been able to assert his individuality he had been a pirate and there was no reason to suppose that he would ever reform himself into anything else there were no extenuating circumstances in his case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6006,332-128985-0020,in his nature there was no alloy nor moderation nor forbearance the appreciative esquemeling who might be called the boswell of the buccaneers could never have met his hero roc,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6007,332-128985-0021,when that bushy bearded pirate was running amuck in the streets but if he had it is not probable that his book would have been written he assures us that when roc was not drunk he was esteemed but at the same time feared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6008,332-128985-0022,but there are various ways of gaining esteem and roc's method certainly succeeded very well in the case of his literary associate as we have seen the hatred of the spaniards by the buccaneers began very early in the settlement of the west indies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6009,332-128985-0023,but in all the instances of ferocious enmity toward the spaniards there has been nothing to equal the feelings of roc the brazilian upon that subject his dislike to everything spanish arose he declared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6010,332-128985-0024,seems to have been that there was nothing too bad for a spaniard the object of his life was to wage bitter war against spanish ships and spanish settlements he seldom gave any quarter to his prisoners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6011,332-128985-0025,then there was nothing for them to do but to go on board their vessels and put out to sea in search of some fresh prize so far roc's career had been very much like that of many other companions of the coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6012,332-128985-0026,differing from them only in respect to intensity and force but he was a clever man with ideas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6013,332-128985-0027,he was cruising about campeachy without seeing any craft that was worth capturing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6014,332-128985-0028,and find out whether or not there were any spanish vessels in the bay which were well laden and which were likely soon to come out so with a small boat filled with some of his trusty men he rowed quietly into the port to see what he could discover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6015,332-128985-0029,and had sent that mild mannered observer into the harbor to investigate into the state of affairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6016,332-128985-0030,but he chose to go himself and he came to grief no sooner did the people on the ships lying in the harbor behold a boat approaching with a big browed broad jawed mariner sitting in the stern,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6017,332-128985-0031,and with a good many more broad backed hairy mariners than were necessary pulling at the oars than they gave the alarm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6018,332-128985-0032,roc must have had a great deal of confidence in his own powers or perhaps he relied somewhat upon the fear which his very presence evoked but he made a mistake this time he had run into the lion's jaw and the lion had closed his teeth upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6019,332-128985-0033,when the pirate captain and his companions were brought before the governor he made no pretence of putting them to trial buccaneers were outlawed by the spanish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6020,332-128985-0034,and were considered as wild beasts to be killed without mercy wherever caught consequently roc and his men were thrown into a dungeon and condemned to be executed if however the spanish governor had known what was good for himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6021,332-128985-0035,during the time that preparations were going on for making examples of these impertinent pirates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6022,332-128985-0036,this was a branch of the business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient if he could not get himself out of scrapes he could not expect to be successful in this case there was no chance of cutting down sentinels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6023,332-128985-0037,or jumping overboard with a couple of wine jars for a life preserver or of doing any of those ordinary things which pirates were in the habit of doing when escaping from their captors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6024,332-128985-0038,inside of a fortress and if they escaped from this they would find themselves unarmed in the midst of a body of spanish soldiers their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6025,332-128985-0039,and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any roc had plenty of wit and he used it well there was a slave probably not a negro nor a native,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6026,332-128985-0040,who came in to bring him food and drink and by the means of this man the pirate hoped to play a trick upon the governor he promised the slave that if he would help him and he told him it would be very easy to do so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6027,332-128985-0041,he would give him money enough to buy his freedom and to return to his friends and this of course was a great inducement to the poor fellow who may have been an englishman or a frenchman in good circumstances at home the slave agreed to the proposals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6028,332-128985-0042,and the first thing he did was to bring some writing materials to roc who thereupon began the composition of a letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6029,332-128985-0043,when he was coming into the bay roc had noticed a large french vessel that was lying at some distance from the town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6030,332-128985-0044,by the hand of roc went on to say that if any harm should come to these brave men who had been taken and imprisoned when they were doing no harm to anybody he would swear in his most solemn manner that never,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6031,332-128985-0045,for the rest of his life would he give quarter to any spaniard who might fall into his hands and he moreover threatened that any kind of vengeance which should become possible for the buccaneers and french united to inflict upon the spanish ships,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6032,332-128985-0046,or upon the town of campeachy should be taken as soon as possible after he should hear of any injury that might be inflicted upon the unfortunate men who were then lying imprisoned in the fortress when the slave came back to roc,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6033,332-128985-0047,the letter was given to him with very particular directions as to what he was to do with it he was to disguise himself as much as possible so that he should not be recognized by the people of the place and then in the night he was to make his way out of the town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6034,332-128985-0048,and early in the morning he was to return as if he had been walking along the shore of the harbor when he was to state that he had been put on shore from the french vessel in the offing with a letter which he was to present to the governor the slave performed his part of the business very well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6035,332-128985-0049,the next day wet and bedraggled from making his way through the weeds and mud of the coast he presented himself at the fortress with his letter and when he was allowed to take it to the governor no one suspected that he was a person employed about the place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6036,332-128985-0050,having fulfilled his mission he departed and when seen again he was the same servant whose business it was to carry food to the prisoners the governor read the letter with a disquieted mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6037,332-128985-0051,he knew that the french ship which was lying outside the harbor was a powerful vessel and he did not like french ships anyway the town had once been taken and very badly treated by a little fleet of french and english buccaneers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6038,332-128985-0052,and he was very anxious that nothing of the kind should happen again there was no great spanish force in the harbor at that time and he did not know how many buccaneering vessels might be able to gather together in the bay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6039,332-128985-0053,if it should become known that the great pirate roc had been put to death in campeachy it was an unusual thing for a prisoner to have such powerful friends so near by and the governor took roc's case into most earnest consideration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6040,332-128985-0054,and he determined to get rid of him as soon as possible he felt himself in the position of a man who has stolen a baby bear and who hears the roar of an approaching parent through the woods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6041,332-128985-0055,to throw away the cub and walk off as though he had no idea there were any bears in that forest would be the inclination of a man so situated and to get rid of the great pirate without provoking the vengeance of his friends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6042,332-128985-0056,was the natural inclination of the governor now roc and his men were treated well and having been brought before the governor were told that in consequence of their having committed no overt act of disorder they would be set at liberty and shipped to england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6043,332-128985-0057,upon the single condition that they would abandon piracy and agree to become quiet citizens in whatever respectable vocation they might select to these terms roc and his men agreed without argument,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6044,332-128985-0058,they declared that they would retire from the buccaneering business and that nothing would suit them better than to return to the ways of civilization and virtue there was a ship about to depart for spain and on this the governor gave roc and his men free passage to the other side of the ocean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6045,332-128985-0059,there is no doubt that our buccaneers would have much preferred to have been put on board the french vessel but as the spanish governor had started his prisoners on the road to reform he did not wish to throw them into the way of temptation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6046,332-128985-0060,by allowing them to associate with such wicked companions as frenchmen and roc made no suggestion of the kind knowing very well how greatly astonished the french captain would be if the governor were to communicate with him on the subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6047,332-128985-0061,on the voyage to spain roc was on his good behavior and he was a man who knew how to behave very well when it was absolutely necessary no doubt there must have been many dull days on board ship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6048,332-128985-0062,when he would have been delighted to gamble to get drunk and to run amuck up and down the deck but he carefully abstained from all these recreations and showed himself to be such an able bodied and willing sailor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6049,332-128985-0063,that the captain allowed him to serve as one of the crew roc knew how to do a great many things not only could he murder and rob but he knew how to turn an honest penny when there was no other way of filling his purse he had learned among the indians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6050,332-128985-0064,how to shoot fish with bow and arrows and on this voyage across the atlantic he occupied all his spare time in sitting in the rigging and shooting the fish which disported themselves about the vessel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6051,332-128985-0065,these fish he sold to the officers and we are told that in this way he earned no less than five hundred crowns perhaps that many dollars if this account is true fish must have been very costly in those days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6052,332-128985-0066,in every way roc behaved so well that for his sake all his men were treated kindly and allowed many privileges but when this party of reformed pirates reached spain and were allowed to go where they pleased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6053,332-128985-0067,they thought no more of the oaths they had taken to abandon piracy than they thought of the oaths which they had been in the habit of throwing right and left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6054,332-128985-0068,but as soon as they could manage it they sailed back to the west indies and eventually found themselves in jamaica,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6055,332-128985-0069,not only did roc cast from him every thought of reformation and a respectable life but he determined to begin the business of piracy on a grander scale than ever before he made a compact with an old french buccaneer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6056,332-128985-0070,and with a large company of buccaneers he actually set out to take a town having lost everything he possessed and having passed such a long time without any employment more profitable than that of shooting fish with a bow and arrows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6057,332-128985-0071,our doughty pirate now desired to make a grand strike and if he could take a town and pillage it of everything valuable it contained he would make a very good fortune in a very short time and might retire if he chose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6058,332-128985-0072,from the active practice of his profession,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6059,332-128985-0073,in yucatan and although this was a bold and rash undertaking the two pirates were bold and rash enough for anything roc had been a prisoner in merida and on account of his knowledge of the town he believed that he and his followers could land upon the coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6060,332-128985-0074,if they could do this it would be an easy matter to rush upon the unsuspecting garrison and having annihilated these make themselves masters of the town but their plans did not work very well they were discovered by some indians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6061,332-128985-0075,after they had landed who hurried to merida and gave notice of the approach of the buccaneers consequently when roc and his companions reached the town they found the garrison prepared for them cannons loaded and all the approaches guarded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6062,332-128985-0076,still the pirates did not hesitate they advanced fiercely to the attack just as they were accustomed to do when they were boarding a spanish vessel but they soon found that fighting on land was very different from fighting at sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6063,332-128985-0077,in a marine combat it is seldom that a party of boarders is attacked in the rear by the enemy although on land such methods of warfare may always be expected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6064,332-128985-0078,and they were therefore greatly dismayed when a party of horsemen from the town who had made a wide detour through the woods suddenly charged upon their rear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6065,332-128985-0079,tributor and a great many of the pirates were killed or taken and roc the brazilian had a terrible fall this most memorable fall occurred in the estimation of john esquemeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6066,332-128985-0080,who knew all about the attack on merida and who wrote the account of it but he had never expected to be called upon to record that his great hero roc the brazilian saved his life after the utter defeat of himself and his companions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6067,332-128985-0081,by ignominiously running away the loyal chronicler had as firm a belief in the absolute inability of his hero to fly from danger as was shown by the scottish douglas when he stood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6068,332-128985-0082,come one come all the bushy browed pirate of the drawn cutlass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6069,332-128985-0083,who would even surrender to say nothing of running away that esquemeling could scarcely believe that roc had retreated from his enemies deserted his friends and turned his back upon the principles which he had always so truculently proclaimed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6070,332-128985-0084,but this downfall of a hero simply shows that esquemeling although he was a member of the piratical body and was proud to consider himself a buccaneer did not understand the true nature of a pirate under the brutality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6071,332-128985-0085,the cruelty the dishonesty and the recklessness of the sea robbers of those days there was nearly always meanness and cowardice roc as we have said in the beginning of this sketch was a typical pirate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6072,332-128985-0086,under certain circumstances he showed himself to have all those brave and savage qualities which esquemeling esteemed and revered and under other circumstances he showed those other qualities which esquemeling despised,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6073,332-128985-0087,but which are necessary to make up the true character of a pirate the historian john seems to have been very much cut up by the manner in which his favorite hero had rounded off his piratical career,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6074,332-128985-0088,and after that he entirely dropped roc from his chronicles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6075,1355-39947-0000,psychotherapy and the community both the physician and the patient find their place in the community the life interests of which are superior to the interests of the individual,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6076,1355-39947-0001,it is an unavoidable question how far from the higher point of view of the social mind the psychotherapeutic efforts should be encouraged or suppressed are there any conditions which suggest suspicion of or direct opposition to such curative work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6077,1355-39947-0002,of course society has to be sure that no possible misuse and damage are to result from such practice fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly but from very different standpoints,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6078,1355-39947-0003,one which is perhaps most often heard in popular circles results from an entire misunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed study of the processes involved it is claimed that suggestive power especially in the form of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6079,1355-39947-0004,hypnotization may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent often this is coupled with telepathic fancies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6080,1355-39947-0005,the hypnotist is believed to have mystic power to bring any person in a distant region under his mental control and thus to be able to carry out any sinister plans by the help of his innocent victim all hypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6081,1355-39947-0006,the presuppositions of such a view are as we know now entirely absurd we know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6082,1355-39947-0007,the imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will the story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6083,1355-39947-0008,is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain it is indeed a frequent symptom in paranoia and other insanities that the patient who feels abnormal organic sensations and abnormal unaccountable impulses interprets them as influences of a distant enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6084,1355-39947-0009,whole pamphlets have been written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations and requests to legislatures have been made in that spirit but the physician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the well known phenomena of the mental disease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6085,1355-39947-0010,to be sure while no one can be hypnotized against his will many a person is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out the wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without willing that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own motives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6086,1355-39947-0011,but if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life we should give up social life itself suggestion is given wherever men come in contact in itself it is neither good nor bad the good resolution and the bad one can be suggested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6087,1355-39947-0012,the good example and the bad can be effective both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique certainly there are some persons who have a stronger influence than others on the imagination of those with whom they come in contact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6088,1355-39947-0013,their expression awakens confidence their voice and their words reach deeper layers of the mind their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the antagonistic ideas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6089,1355-39947-0014,but the chief difference lies after all in the different degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such impressions the easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict he may catch suggestions everywhere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6090,1355-39947-0015,any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions what he needs is training in firmness the application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6091,1355-39947-0016,no possible source of danger on a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and which are not without sympathy with true science in recent times this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression it is an objection from the standpoint of morality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6092,1355-39947-0017,belonging therefore entirely to the purposive view of the mind but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purposive view too as long as we discussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6093,1355-39947-0018,no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question as soon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community it becomes our duty to bring the causal and the purposive view into harmony and it would be narrow and short sighted simply to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6094,1355-39947-0019,draw the practical consequences of a naturalistic view of the mind without inquiring whether or not serious interests in the purposive sphere are injured if there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy it is the duty of the community to consider it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6095,1355-39947-0020,this opposition argues as follows hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom whatever the patient may reach in the altered states is reached without his own effort while he is the passive receiver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6096,1355-39947-0021,his achievement has therefore no moral value and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent it would be better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6097,1355-39947-0022,if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined no one ought to take such arguments lightly the spirit which directs them is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for superficial goods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6098,1355-39947-0023,no one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6099,1355-39947-0024,profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create more than this they have to acknowledge it to gain a basis for their attack just because the hypnotizer can entirely change the desires and passions the habits and perversities of the suffering victim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6100,1355-39947-0025,he seems to them a moral wrongdoer who negates the principle of human freedom a forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist the great psychological crime it says to the hypnotist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6101,1355-39947-0026,by your own testimony you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self control in proportion as you deprive him of the power of self control,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6102,1355-39947-0027,you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend in proportion as you deprive him of the free control and exercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6103,1355-39947-0028,you thereby rob him of those powers upon which he must depend for the achievement of individual immortality but this censure too is entirely mistaken not because it urges the purposive views against the causal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6104,1355-39947-0029,but because it is in error as to the facts such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6105,1355-39947-0030,it is quite true that if i hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awaking the book which lies on my table he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom he feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6106,1355-39947-0031,as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6107,1355-39947-0032,but after a long experience i have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts on the contrary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6108,1355-39947-0033,every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight his own will is presupposition for being hypnotized,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6109,1355-39947-0034,if again and again i hesitate to undertake new cases it is just because i have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses the joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6110,1355-39947-0035,is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments to make a man fight where despair is inevitable and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers can certainly not be the moral demand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6111,1355-39947-0036,morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task in our discussion of the mental symptoms i reported as an illustration of the suggestive treatment of the drug passion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6112,1355-39947-0037,the case of a morphinist to make clear this purposive side of the case as against the causal one which alone interested the physician i may add a few features to the short report as a typical example,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6113,1355-39947-0038,when that man left my laboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness you might well have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and pleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the dangerous desire for morphine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6114,1355-39947-0039,in truth it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling he had been for years a slave to his passion to quote from his little autobiography when i realized that i was addicted to morphine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6115,1355-39947-0040,that is coming to anyone who is the user of opium or any of its alkaloids for the first few months i found great relief after every injection of morphine but soon i could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep i got was in the daytime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6116,1355-39947-0041,i finally went to the sanitarium of a doctor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6117,1355-39947-0042,when i first went to see the professor in the harvard psychological laboratory i was using between thirty two and thirty eight grains of morphine daily he put me under his treatment october sixth and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine grains a day or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6118,1355-39947-0043,three doses of three grains a day i took my hypodermic as directed but on the following day i lay on the bed too exhausted to get up even to get around the room and i could not eat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6119,1355-39947-0044,the desire for the drug was something terrible but in about four days i got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where i spent twenty two hours of the twenty four on the bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6120,1355-39947-0045,but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6121,1355-39947-0046,i was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6122,1355-39947-0047,these reductions of the dose were made a week apart and sometimes only two days the worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each which was about january tenth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6123,1355-39947-0048,at this time i had the worst two days of my life i tried whiskey but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then the desire was worse than ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6124,1355-39947-0049,he was thus at every moment during the day and night in full possession of the deadly poison with which he could have fully satisfied his craving it was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6125,1355-39947-0050,and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital and yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist we do not eliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6126,1355-39947-0051,we have no mystic power by which our will simply takes hold of the other man's will but we inhibit and suppress by influence on the imagination those abnormal impulses which resist the sound desires if that were immoral,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6127,1355-39947-0052,we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements every sound respect for authority which makes a child willing to accept the advice and maxims of his elders is just such an influence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6128,1355-39947-0053,if it were really a moral demand that the will be left to its own resources and that no outside influence come to strengthen its power or remove its hindrances or smooth its path then we ought to let the children grow up as nature created them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6129,1355-39947-0054,and ought not to try to suppress from without by discipline and training by love and encouragement the willful impulses and the ugly habits even every good model for imitation is such a suggestive influence from without and every solemn appeal to loyalty and friendship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6130,1355-39947-0055,to patriotism and religion increases the degree of suggestibility that is the glory of life that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6131,1355-39947-0056,and he who by suggestion helps the weak mind to overcome obstacles which the strong mind can overthrow from its inborn resources works for the good of the individual and of the community in the spirit of truest morality much more justified than such,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6132,1355-39947-0057,ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere it must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6133,1355-39947-0058,ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skillful use to hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous if it is done by the unfit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6134,1355-39947-0059,we have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6135,1355-39947-0060,the possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs or of creating unintentionally by suggestion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6136,1355-39947-0061,injurious effects are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work certainly there is no physician who is not liable to make mistakes and a physician who has never given any attention to psychology and psychiatry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6137,1355-39947-0062,would also be a rather poor agent of psychotherapeutic methods but the probability is that such a physician would simply abstain by principle from all psychotherapeutic methods his mistake only begins if from his lack of acquaintance with the subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6138,1355-39947-0063,he draws the conclusion that the method itself is undesirable that his real preparation ought to include psychological studies we have pointed out before and the time seems ripe for the community to urge such a reform of the studies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6139,1355-39947-0064,all that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist as such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment and a psychological clinic managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6140,1355-39947-0065,is certainly not better than a church clinic i cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiment's sake nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6141,1355-39947-0066,if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself science has the right to make hypnotic experiments or experiments with abnormal mental states only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6142,1355-39947-0067,and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6143,1355-39947-0068,criminal on some other objections which interest the community as such we had to touch before and there is no need of returning to them with any fullness of argument we spoke of the danger which the mental cures carry with them when they are based on any particular creed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6144,1355-39947-0069,what is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6145,1355-39947-0070,that is indeed one of the central dangers of all non medical suggestive cures that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6146,1355-39947-0071,any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion the intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6147,1355-39947-0072,had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of missus eddy's science and health from a cultural viewpoint too suggestive therapeutics must stand the higher the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6148,1355-39947-0073,no theory of the world and of god ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effects freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6149,1355-39947-0074,who does not need the strong religious reenforcement of the suggestion because he reenforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6150,1355-39947-0075,even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudophilosophy stands behind the therapeutic work the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6151,1355-39947-0076,the community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non religious work social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6152,1355-39947-0077,still more that is true of the healing of the sick whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the whole community,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6153,1355-39947-0078,the fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed to the background and that thus the church,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6154,1355-39947-0079,in imitating that which others can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which the church alone can do the final outcome is therefore practically in every way the same from whatever starting point we may come we are led to the conviction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6155,1355-39947-0080,that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one but the interest of the community is not only a negative one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6156,1355-39947-0081,society does not only ask where psychical treatment can be dangerous but asks with not less right whether the scheme and the method might not be fructified for other social ends besides the mere healing of the sick if psychotherapy demonstrates that for instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6157,1355-39947-0082,hypnotism makes possible the reshaping of a pathological mind it is a natural thought to use the same power for remodeling perhaps the lazy or the intemperate the careless or the inattentive the dishonest or the criminal mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6158,1355-39947-0083,both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions and social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for social movements in future times,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6159,1355-39947-0084,there can be no doubt that the possibility of such remodeling activity is given but as far as education is concerned certainly grave misgivings ought to be felt when we spoke of the treatment of the sick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6160,1355-39947-0085,we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not diseases in the same way hypnotic suggestion might reenforce a single trait but would not reform the personality of the child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6161,1355-39947-0086,yes the artificial reenforcement of such special features would deprive education of that which is the most essential namely the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6162,1355-39947-0087,wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6163,1355-39947-0088,in the form of good example and persuasions authority and discipline love and sympathy that holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure for instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6164,1355-39947-0089,i have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits such as the habit of biting the nails a child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6165,1355-39947-0090,and now that under the influence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained for mastering the next lesson in the same way some naughty traits might be artificially removed but the child would not gain anything towards the much more important power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6166,1355-39947-0091,of suppressing an ugly tendency by his own effort all that finds its limits where the inhibitions or obstacles in the brain of the child are too strong possibly to be overcome by the own good will but in that case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6167,1355-39947-0092,psychotherapy has its right the feeble minded and the retarded child the perverse child and the emotionally unstable child belong under the care of the physician,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6168,1355-39947-0093,which are at his disposal still more complex is the criminological problem it sounds like an easy remedy for the greatest social calamity if it is proposed simply to hypnotize the criminal and to supplant his antisocial will by a moral one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6169,1355-39947-0094,and if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the born criminal even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6170,1355-39947-0095,but the conception of the born criminal is also only a label which is superficially used for a great variety of minds that men are born with a brain which necessarily produces criminal actions is not indicated by any facts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6171,1355-39947-0096,the varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions we recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements but is characterized only by a change of proportions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6172,1355-39947-0097,there is too much or too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6173,3807-4923-0000,missus vickers pale and sick with terror yet sustained by that strange courage of which we have before spoken passed rapidly under the open skylight and prepared to ascend sylvia her romance crushed by too dreadful reality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6174,3807-4923-0001,clung to her mother with one hand and with the other pressed close to her little bosom the english history in her all absorbing fear she had forgotten to lay it down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6175,3807-4923-0002,and shuddering shook her head the men above swore impatiently at the delay and the three hastened on deck who's to command the brig now asked undaunted bates as they came up i am says john rex,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6176,3807-4923-0003,and with these brave fellows i'll take her round the world the touch of bombast was not out of place it jumped so far with the humour of the convicts that they set up a feeble cheer at which sylvia frowned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6177,3807-4923-0004,frightened as she was the prison bred child was as much astonished at hearing convicts cheer as a fashionable lady would be to hear her footman quote poetry bates however practical and calm took quite another view of the case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6178,3807-4923-0005,the bold project so boldly avowed seemed to him a sheer absurdity the dandy and a crew of nine convicts navigate a brig round the world preposterous why not a man aboard could work a reckoning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6179,3807-4923-0006,his nautical fancy pictured the osprey helplessly rolling on the swell of the southern ocean or hopelessly locked in the ice of the antarctic seas and he dimly guessed at the fate of the deluded ten,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6180,3807-4923-0007,even if they got safe to port the chances of final escape were all against them for what account could they give of themselves overpowered by these reflections the honest fellow made one last effort to charm his captors back to their pristine bondage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6181,3807-4923-0008,fools he cried do you know what you are about to do you will never escape give up the brig and i will declare before my god upon the bible that i will say nothing but give all good characters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6182,3807-4923-0009,lesly and another burst into a laugh at this wild proposition but rex who had weighed his chances well beforehand felt the force of the pilot's speech and answered seriously it's no use talking he said shaking his still handsome head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6183,3807-4923-0010,we have got the brig and we mean to keep her i can navigate her though i am no seaman so you needn't talk further about it mister bates it's liberty we require what are you going to do with us asked bates leave you behind bates's face blanched,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6184,3807-4923-0011,what here yes it don't look a picturesque spot does it and yet i've lived here for some years and he grinned bates was silent the logic of that grin was unanswerable come cried the dandy shaking off his momentary melancholy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6186,3807-4923-0013,but i have no wish to leave you without clothes bates listened in a sort of dismal admiration at this courtly convict he could not have spoken like that had life depended on it now my little lady continued rex,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6187,3807-4923-0014,run down with your mamma and don't be frightened sylvia flashed burning red at this indignity frightened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6188,3807-4923-0015,frightened let me pass prisoner the whole deck burst into a great laugh at this and poor missus vickers paused trembling for the consequences of the child's temerity to thus taunt the desperate convict who held their lives in his hands seemed sheer madness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6189,3807-4923-0016,in the boldness of the speech however lay its safeguard rex whose politeness was mere bravado was stung to the quick by the reflection upon his courage and the bitter accent with which the child had pronounced the word prisoner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6190,3807-4923-0017,the generic name of convicts made him bite his lips with rage had he had his will he would have struck the little creature to the deck but the hoarse laugh of his companions warned him to forbear there is public opinion even among convicts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6191,3807-4923-0018,and rex dared not vent his passion on so helpless an object as men do in such cases he veiled his anger beneath an affectation of amusement in order to show that he was not moved by the taunt he smiled upon the taunter more graciously than ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6192,3807-4923-0019,your daughter has her father's spirit madam said he to missus vickers with a bow bates opened his mouth to listen his ears were not large enough to take in the words of this complimentary convict he began to think that he was the victim of a nightmare he absolutely felt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6193,3807-4923-0020,that john rex was a greater man at that moment than john bates as missus vickers descended the hatchway the boat with frere and the soldiers came within musket range and lesly according to orders fired his musket over their heads,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6194,3807-4923-0021,shouting to them to lay to but frere boiling with rage at the manner in which the tables had been turned on him had determined not to resign his lost authority without a struggle disregarding the summons he came straight on with his eyes fixed on the vessel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6195,3807-4923-0022,it was now nearly dark and the figures on the deck were indistinguishable the indignant lieutenant could but guess at the condition of affairs suddenly from out of the darkness a voice hailed him hold water back water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6196,3807-4923-0023,it cried and was then seemingly choked in its owner's throat the voice was the property of mister bates standing near the side he had observed rex and fair bring up a great pig of iron erst used as part of the ballast of the brig,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6197,3807-4923-0024,and poise it on the rail their intention was but too evident and honest bates like a faithful watch dog barked to warn his master bloodthirsty cheshire caught him by the throat and frere unheeding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6202,3807-4923-0029,the answer came pat to the question from the dark hull of the brig broke a flash and a report and a musket ball cut the water beside them with a chirping noise between the black indistinct mass which represented the brig,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6208,3807-4923-0035,it seemed to him that virtue had gone out of it when they reached the brig they found that the jolly boat had been lowered and laid alongside in her were eleven persons bates with forehead gashed and hands bound the stunned grimes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6215,3807-4923-0042,poor missus vickers with a woman's quick instinct saw this and even amid her own trouble found leisure to console him the wretches she said under her breath as frere was flung down beside her to subject you to such indignity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6219,3807-4923-0046,the soldiers paused irresolute to join the mutineers meant a certainty of hard work with a chance of ultimate hanging yet to stay with the prisoners was as far as they could see to incur the inevitable fate of starvation on a barren coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6221,3807-4923-0048,go with him ye beggars said he and leave us honest men oh ye'll get a tying up for this the phrase tying up brought with it recollection of the worst portion of military discipline the cat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6222,3807-4923-0049,and revived in the minds of the pair already disposed to break the yoke that sat so heavily upon them a train of dismal memories the life of a soldier on a convict station was at that time a hard one he was often stinted in rations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6223,3807-4923-0050,and of necessity deprived of all rational recreation while punishment for offences was prompt and severe the companies drafted to the penal settlements were not composed of the best material and the pair had good precedent for the course they were about to take,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6224,3807-4923-0051,which is it to be we'll go with you says the man who had pulled the stroke in the whale boat spitting into the water with averted face upon which utterance the convicts burst into joyous oaths and the pair were received with much hand shaking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6225,3807-4923-0052,then rex with lyon and riley as a guard got into the whale boat and having loosed the two prisoners from their bonds ordered them to take the place of russen and fair the whale boat was manned by the seven mutineers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6226,3807-4923-0053,rex steering fair russen and the two recruits pulling and the other four standing up with their muskets levelled at the jolly boat their long slavery had begotten such a dread of authority in these men that they feared it even when it was bound and menaced by four muskets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6227,3807-4923-0054,keep your distance shouted cheshire as frere and bates in obedience to orders began to pull the jolly boat towards the shore and in this fashion was the dismal little party conveyed to the mainland it was night when they reached it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6228,3807-4923-0055,but the clear sky began to thrill with a late moon as yet unrisen and the waves breaking gently upon the beach glimmered with a radiance born of their own motion frere and bates jumping ashore helped out missus vickers sylvia and the wounded grimes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6229,3807-4923-0056,this being done under the muzzles of the muskets rex commanded that bates and frere should push the jolly boat as far as they could from the shore and riley catching her by a boat hook as she came towards them she was taken in tow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6230,3807-4923-0057,three cheers for old england and liberty upon which a great shout went up echoed by the grim hills which had witnessed so many miseries to the wretched five this exultant mirth sounded like a knell of death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6231,3807-4923-0058,great god cried bates running up to his knees in water after the departing boats would you leave us here to starve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6232,3807-4955-0000,chapter twenty five the flight gabbett guided by the crow had determined to beach the captured boat on the southern point of cape surville it will be seen by those who have followed the description of the topography of colonel arthur's penitentiary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6233,3807-4955-0001,that nothing but the desperate nature of the attempt could have justified so desperate a measure the perpendicular cliffs seemed to render such an attempt certain destruction but vetch who had been employed in building the pier at the neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6234,3807-4955-0002,knew that on the southern point of the promontory was a strip of beach upon which the company might by good fortune land in safety with something of the decision of his leader rex the crow determined at once that in their desperate plight this was the only measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6235,3807-4955-0003,and setting his teeth as he seized the oar that served as a rudder he put the boat's head straight for the huge rock that formed the northern horn of pirates bay save for the faint phosphorescent radiance of the foaming waves the darkness was intense,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6236,3807-4955-0004,and burgess for some minutes pulled almost at random in pursuit the same tremendous flash of lightning which had saved the life of mc nab by causing rex to miss his aim showed to the commandant the whale boat balanced on the summit of an enormous wave,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6237,3807-4955-0005,and apparently about to be flung against the wall of rock which magnified in the flash seemed frightfully near to them the next instant burgess himself his boat lifted by the swiftly advancing billow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6238,3807-4955-0006,saw a wild waste of raging seas scooped into abysmal troughs in which the bulk of a leviathan might wallow at the bottom of one of these valleys of water lay the mutineers boat looking with its outspread oars like some six legged insect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6239,3807-4955-0007,floating in a pool of ink the great cliff whose every scar and crag was as distinct as though its huge bulk was but a yard distant seemed to shoot out from its base towards the struggling insect a broad flat straw that was a strip of dry land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6240,3807-4955-0008,the next instant the rushing water carrying the six legged atom with it creamed up over this strip of beach,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6241,3807-4955-0009,appeared to stoop down over the ocean and as it stooped the billow rolled onwards the boat glided down into the depths and the whole phantasmagoria was swallowed up in the tumultuous darkness of the tempest burgess his hair bristling with terror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6242,3807-4955-0010,shouted to put the boat about but he might with as much reason have shouted at an avalanche the wind blew his voice away and emptied it violently into the air a snarling billow jerked the oar from his hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6243,3807-4955-0011,despite the desperate efforts of the soldiers the boat was whirled up the mountain of water like a leaf on a water spout and a second flash of lightning showed them what seemed a group of dolls struggling in the surf and a walnut shell bottom upwards was driven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6244,3807-4955-0012,by the recoil of the waves towards them for an instant all thought that they must share the fate which had overtaken the unlucky convicts but burgess succeeded in trimming the boat and awed by the peril he had so narrowly escaped gave the order to return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6245,3807-4955-0013,as the men set the boat's head to the welcome line of lights that marked the neck a black spot balanced upon a black line was swept under their stern and carried out to sea as it passed them this black spot emitted a cry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6246,3807-4955-0014,and they knew that it was one of the shattered boat's crew clinging to an oar he was the only one of em alive said burgess bandaging his sprained wrist two hours afterwards at the neck and he's food for the fishes by this time he was mistaken however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6247,3807-4955-0015,fate had in reserve for the crew of villains a less merciful death than that of drowning aided by the lightning and that wonderful good luck which urges villainy to its destruction vetch beached the boat and the party bruised and bleeding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6248,3807-4955-0016,reached the upper portion of the shore in safety of all this number only cox was lost he was pulling stroke oar and being something of a laggard stood in the way of the crow who seeing the importance of haste in preserving his own skin plucked the man backwards by the collar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6249,3807-4955-0017,and passed over his sprawling body to the shore cox grasping at anything to save himself clutched an oar and the next moment found himself borne out with the overturned whale boat by the under tow he was drifted past his only hope of rescue the guard boat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6250,3807-4955-0018,with a velocity that forbade all attempts at rescue and almost before the poor scoundrel had time to realize his condition he was in the best possible way of escaping the hanging that his comrades had so often humorously prophesied for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6251,3807-4955-0019,being a strong and vigorous villain however he clung tenaciously to his oar and even unbuckling his leather belt passed it round the slip of wood that was his salvation girding himself to it as firmly as he was able,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6252,3807-4955-0020,in this condition plus a swoon from exhaustion he was descried by the helmsman of the pretty mary a few miles from cape surville at daylight next morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6253,3807-4955-0021,lowered a boat and picked him up nearly bisected by the belt gorged with salt water frozen with cold and having two ribs broken the victim of vetch's murderous quickness retained sufficient life to survive blunt's remedies for nearly two hours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6254,3807-4955-0022,during that time he stated that his name was cox that he had escaped from port arthur with eight others that john rex was the leader of the expedition that the others were all drowned and that he believed john rex had been retaken having placed blunt in possession of these particulars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6255,3807-4955-0023,he further said that it pricked him to breathe cursed jemmy vetch the settlement and the sea and so impenitently died blunt smoked three pipes and then altered the course of the pretty mary two points to the eastward and ran for the coast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6301,7859-102519-0029,while they were out at sea a storm arose and the boat began to fill one of his companions cried to justinian to make his peace with god and pardon his enemies ere he died but the emperor's stern soul was not bent by the tempest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6306,7859-102519-0034,so justinian recovered his throne without fighting for the people had by this time half forgotten his tyranny and regretted the rule of the house of heraclius but they were soon to find out that they had erred in submitting to the exile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6307,7859-102519-0035,and should have resisted him at all hazards justinian came back in a relentless mood bent on nothing but revenging his mutilated nose and his ten years of exile his first act was to send for the two usurpers who had sat on his throne,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6309,7859-102519-0037,there he sat in state using their prostrate bodies as a footstool while his adherents chanted the verse from the ninety first psalm thou shalt tread on the lion and asp the young lion and dragon shalt thou trample under thy feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6310,7859-102519-0038,and apsimarus after this strange exhibition the two ex emperors were beheaded their execution began a reign of terror for justinian had his oath to keep and was set on wreaking vengeance on every one who had been concerned in his deposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6313,7859-102519-0041,these atrocities were mere samples of the general conduct of justinian in a few years he had made himself so much detested that it might be said that he had been comparatively popular in the days of his first reign,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6314,7859-102519-0042,the army of the tyrant laid down their arms when philippicus approached and he was led forth and beheaded without further delay an end too good for such a monster the conqueror also sought out and slew his little son tiberius,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6365,7859-102521-0001,it would have been well for his reputation in history unhappily for himself though happily enough for the east roman realm he survived yet twenty years to carry through a series of measures which were in his eyes not less important than the repulse of the moslems from his capital,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6381,7859-102521-0017,there was of course no legality in the act and karl the great was in no real sense the successor of honorius and romulus augustulus but he ruled a group of kingdoms which embraced the larger half of the old western empire and formed a fair equipoise to the realm now ruled by irene from eight hundred then onward we have once more a west roman empire in existence as well as the east roman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6385,2836-5355-0003,than i found myself overwhelmed with business and away from it i could not get even now i can only remain with you a couple of days for i must hasten back to town you are breaking faith already she said after hearing him calmly to the end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6386,2836-5355-0004,your words are not words of truth but of deceit you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6387,2836-5355-0005,what fancies you do take up uttered francis levison some time subsequent to your departure she quietly went on one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6388,2836-5355-0006,i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning of your departure it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced she spoke so quietly so apparently without feeling or passion that sir francis was agreeably astonished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6389,2836-5355-0007,he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask but he was an ill tempered man and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now lady isabel continued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6390,2836-5355-0008,it would have been better to have undeceived me then to have told me that the hopes i was cherishing for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain i did not judge so he replied the excited state you then appeared to be in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6391,2836-5355-0009,would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it you deem that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6392,2836-5355-0010,well isabel you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks but her voice sounded calm as before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6393,2836-5355-0011,when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6394,2836-5355-0012,and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed he did not take the trouble to look at it i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy he resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6395,2836-5355-0013,and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay interrupted lady isabel you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife were you to propose to do so this day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6396,2836-5355-0014,and bring a clergyman into the room to perform the ceremony it would be futile the injury to the child can never be repaired and for myself i cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6397,2836-5355-0015,if you have taken this aversion to me it cannot be helped he coldly said inwardly congratulating himself let us not doubt at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6398,2836-5355-0016,she shook her head all the reparation in your power to make all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin it and the effects must lie upon me forever oh sin was the derisive exclamation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6399,2836-5355-0017,you ladies should think of that beforehand yes she sadly answered may heaven help all to do so who may be tempted as i was if you mean that as a reproach to me it's rather out of place chafed sir francis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6400,2836-5355-0018,whose fits of ill temper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger toward your husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6401,2836-5355-0019,quite true was her reply and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabel if it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse it is of no consequence to smooth over facts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6402,2836-5355-0020,i do not understand what you would imply she said drawing her shawl round her with a fresh shiver how on the wrong scent with regard to your husband and that hare girl you were blindly outrageously jealous of him go on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6403,2836-5355-0021,and i say i think you are on the wrong scent i do not believe mister carlyle ever thought of the girl in that way what do you mean she gasped they had a secret between them not of love a secret of business and those interviews they had together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6404,2836-5355-0022,her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the interview he spoke quietly now quite in an equal tone of reasoning it was his way when the ill temper was upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6405,2836-5355-0023,and the calmer he spoke the more cutting were his words he need not have told her this what was the secret she inquired in a low tone nay i can't explain all they did not take me into their confidence they did not even take you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6406,2836-5355-0024,and carlyle was acting in it under the rose for missus hare she could not seek out carlyle herself so she sent the young lady that's all i know how did you know it i had reason to think so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6407,2836-5355-0025,what reason i must request you to tell me i overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings and so gathered my information you told a different tale to me sir francis was her remark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6408,2836-5355-0026,as she turned her indignant eyes toward him sir francis laughed all stratagems are fair in love and war she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6409,2836-5355-0027,over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle what have you named that young article there the name which ought to have been his by inheritance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6410,2836-5355-0028,was her icy answer let's see how old is he now he was born on the last day of august sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6411,2836-5355-0029,who is he like isabel my handsome self were he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6412,2836-5355-0030,outwardly into calmness again what else retorted sir francis you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6413,2836-5355-0031,she made no reply sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child returned to the fire and stood a few moments with his back to it is my room prepared for me do you know he presently asked no it is not she quietly rejoined,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6414,2836-5355-0032,these apartments are mine now they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation will you be so obliging i am not strong as to hand me that writing case sir francis walked to the table she indicated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6415,2836-5355-0033,which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writing case from it gave it to her she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow unlocked the case and took from it some bank notes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6416,2836-5355-0034,i received these from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6417,2836-5355-0035,allow me to return them to you count them return them to me for what inquired sir francis in amazement i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long take them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6418,2836-5355-0036,if it be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so he said i must confess i think it may be the wisest course as things have come to this pass for a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6419,2836-5355-0037,remember though that it is your doing not mine but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel a sum we will fix upon the amount amicably,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6420,2836-5355-0038,i beg of you to cease she passionately interrupted what do you take me for take you for why how can you live you have no fortune you must receive assistance from some one i will not receive it from you if the whole world denied me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6421,2836-5355-0039,sarcastically rejoined sir francis generous man a flush deep and painful dyed her cheeks i should have said my late husband you need not have reminded me of the mistake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6422,2836-5355-0040,if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child he at any rate falls to my share i shall give you a few hundred a year with him she beat her hands before her as if beating off the man and his words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6423,2836-5355-0041,whom do you take me for what do you take me for she repeated rising in her bitter mortification if you have put me beyond the pale of the world i am still lord mount severn's daughter you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6424,2836-5355-0042,don't i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6425,2836-5355-0043,resumed sir francis in a little time you may probably wish to recall it in which case a line addressed to me at my banker's will lady isabel drew herself up put away those notes if you please she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6426,2836-5355-0044,he took out his pocket book and placed the bank notes within it your clothes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6427,2836-5355-0045,you will have the goodness to order pierre to take away this afternoon and now sir francis i believe that is all we will part to remain mortal enemies from henceforth is that to be it to be strangers she replied correcting him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6428,2836-5355-0046,i wish you a good day so you will not even shake hands with me isabel i would prefer not and thus they parted sir francis left the room but not immediately the house he went into a distant apartment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6429,2836-5355-0047,and calling the servants before him there were but two gave them each a year's wages in advance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6430,2836-5355-0048,then he paid a visit to the landlord and handed him likewise a year's rent in advance making the same remark after that he ordered dinner at a hotel and the same night he and pierre departed on their journey home again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6431,2836-5355-0049,sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6432,2836-5355-0050,into an adjoining room when lady isabel lay down to rest she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep than she had known of late also into a dream she thought she was back at east lynne not back in one sense,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6433,2836-5355-0051,but that she seemed never to have gone away from it walking in the flower garden with mister carlyle while the three children played on the lawn her arm was within her husband's and he was relating something to her what the news was she could not remember afterward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6434,2836-5355-0052,excepting that it was connected with the office and old mister dill and that mister carlyle laughed when he told it they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter she awoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6435,2836-5355-0053,alas it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her this last child the ill fated little being in the cradle beside her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6746,1594-135914-0024,i must own that from the first moment he saw me he perhaps designed to devote himself to me and conceived hopes of engaging me to admit his love i guessed at this by the eagerness which he shewed in entertaining me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6751,1594-135914-0029,he perceived it but far from availing himself of my frailty and notwithstanding the flame which consumed him he still remained steady in his duty and all that his passion could force from him were the words i have already repeated to your majesty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6753,1594-135914-0031,and enlarging on the obligations she owed to ganem but above all she highly extolled his discretion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6762,1594-135914-0040,she then withdrew into the apartment she had occupied before her melancholy adventure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6764,1594-135914-0042,the next day she took another purse of the same value and in the like equipage as the day before went to the square of the jewellers shops and stopping at the gateway without alighting sent one of her black eunuchs for the syndic or chief of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6765,1594-135914-0043,the syndic who was a most charitable man and spent above two thirds of his income in relieving poor strangers sick or in distress did not make fetnah wait knowing by her dress that she was a lady belonging to the palace i apply myself to you said she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6767,1594-135914-0045,i am also satisfied that you prevent their wants and that nothing is more grateful to you than to have an opportunity of relieving their misery madam answered the syndic i shall obey your commands with pleasure but if you desire to exercise your charity in person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6768,1594-135914-0046,and will be pleased to step to my house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6769,1594-135914-0047,i met them yesterday as they were coming into the city they were in a deplorable condition and it moved me the more because i thought they were persons of rank through all the rags that covered them notwithstanding the impression the sun has made on their faces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6770,1594-135914-0048,whilst she herself led them to our warm bath and gave them clean linen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6771,1594-135914-0049,because we wish to let them take some rest before we trouble them with our questions fetnah without knowing why felt a curiosity to see them the syndic would have conducted her to his house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6772,1594-135914-0050,for they were the persons the syndic had been speaking of to fetnah the syndic's wife being informed by the slave that a lady from the palace was in her house was hastening to meet her but fetnah who had followed the slave did not give her time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6773,1594-135914-0051,on her coming into the chamber the syndic's wife prostrated herself before her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6774,1594-135914-0052,fetnah raised her up and said my good lady,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6775,1594-135914-0053,madam answered the syndic's wife they lie in those beds you see by each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6776,1594-135914-0054,good woman said she i come to offer you my assistance i have considerable interest in this city and may be of service to you and your companion madam answered ganem's mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6777,1594-135914-0055,that fetnah and the syndic's wife could not forbear letting fall some tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6778,1594-135914-0056,said to ganem's mother be so kind as to tell us your misfortunes and recount your story you cannot make the relation to any persons better disposed to use all possible means to comfort you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6779,1594-135914-0057,madam replied abou ayoub's disconsolate widow a favourite of the commander of the true believers a lady whose name is fetnah is the occasion of all our misfortunes these words were like a thunderbolt to the favourite,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6780,1594-135914-0058,but suppressing her agitation and concern she suffered ganem's mother to proceed in the following manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6781,1594-135914-0059,i had a son called ganem who coming to trade at bagdad has been accused of carrying off fetnah,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6782,1594-135914-0060,and then to banish us out of syria for ever but how unworthy soever our usage has been,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6783,1594-135914-0061,what a pleasure would it be for his sister and me to see him again embracing him we should forget the loss of our property and all the evils we have suffered on his account alas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6784,1594-135914-0062,no doubt of it said fetnah interrupting her there he is no more guilty than you are i can assure you of his innocence for i am that very fetnah you so much complain of who through some fatality in my stars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6785,1594-135914-0063,have occasioned you so many misfortunes to me you must impute the loss of your son if he is no more but if i have occasioned your misfortune i can in some measure relieve it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6786,1594-135914-0064,and doubt not he will do you as much good as he has done you injury you are no longer his enemies he waits for ganem to requite the service he has done me by uniting our fortunes he gives me to him for his consort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6787,1594-135914-0065,therefore look on me as your daughter and permit me to vow eternal duty and affection having so said she bowed down on ganem's mother who was so astonished that she could return no answer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6788,1594-135914-0066,fetnah held her long in her arms and only left her to embrace the daughter who sitting up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6789,1594-135914-0067,the wealth ganem had in this city is not lost it is in my apartment in the palace but i know all the treasure of the world cannot comfort you without ganem if i may judge of you by myself blood is no less powerful than love in great minds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6790,1594-135914-0068,but why should we despair of seeing him again we shall find him the happiness of meeting with you makes me conceive fresh hopes perhaps this is the last day of your sufferings and the beginning of a greater felicity than you enjoyed in damascus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6791,1594-135914-0069,when ganem was with you fetnah would have proceeded but the syndic of the jewellers coming in interrupted her madam said he to her i come from seeing a very moving object it is a young man whom a camel driver had just carried to an hospital,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6792,1594-135914-0070,he was bound with cords on a camel because he had not strength enough to sit they had already unbound him and were carrying him into the hospital when i happened to pass by i went up to the young man viewed him attentively,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6793,1594-135914-0071,and fancied his countenance was not altogether unknown to me i asked him some questions concerning his family and his country but all the answers i could get were sighs and tears i took pity on him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6794,1594-135914-0072,perceived that he had need to have particular care taken of him i would not permit him to be put into the hospital for i am too well acquainted with their way of managing the sick and am sensible of the incapacity of the physicians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6795,1594-135914-0073,i have caused him to be brought to my own house by my slaves and they are now in a private room where i placed him putting on some of my own linen and treating him as they would do myself fetnah's heart beat at these words of the jeweller,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6796,1594-135914-0074,and she felt a sudden emotion for which she could not account shew me said she to the syndic into the sick man's room i should be glad to see him the syndic conducted her and whilst she was going thither,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6797,1594-135914-0075,whose eyes were closed his countenance pale disfigured and bathed in tears she gazed earnestly on him her heart beat and she fancied she beheld ganem but yet she would not believe her eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6798,1594-135914-0076,though she found something of ganem in the objets she beheld yet in other respects he appeared so different that she durst not imagine it was he that lay before her unable however to withstand the earnest desire of being satisfied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6799,1594-135914-0077,ganem said she with a trembling voice is it you i behold having spoken these words she stopped to give the young man time to answer but observing that he seemed insensible alas ganem added she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6800,1594-135914-0078,it is not you that i address my imagination being overcharged with your image has given to a stranger a deceitful resemblance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6801,1594-135914-0079,however indisposed would know the voice of fetnah at the name of fetnah ganem for it was really he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6802,1594-135914-0080,ah madam said he by what miracle he could say no more such a sudden transport of joy seized him that he fainted away fetnah and the syndic did all they could to bring him to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6803,1594-135914-0081,but as soon as they perceived he began to revive the syndic desired the lady to withdraw lest the sight of her should heighten his disorder the young man having recovered looked all around and not seeing what he sought exclaimed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6809,1594-135914-0087,there was no occasion for the syndic's saying any more to ganem's mother as soon as she was told that she could not converse with her son without hazarding his life she ceased insisting to go and see him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6810,1594-135914-0088,fetnah then said let us bless heaven for having brought us all together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6814,1594-135914-0092,and she satisfied his inquiries saying so many things in commendation of ganem's mother and sister he desired to see them as well as the young merchant though haroon al rusheed was passionate and in his heat sometimes guilty of cruel actions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6815,1594-135914-0093,having therefore no longer cause to doubt but that he had unjustly persecuted ganem and his family and had publicly wronged them he resolved to make them public satisfaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6819,1594-135914-0097,rest and the good medicines he had taken but above all the different situation of his mind had wrought so good an effect that the syndic thought he might without danger see his mother his sister and his mistress provided he was prepared to receive them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6820,1594-135914-0098,because there was ground to fear that not knowing his mother and sister were at bagdad the sight of them might occasion too great surprise and joy it was therefore resolved that fetnah should first go alone into ganem's chamber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6829,1594-135914-0107,and he could not forbear letting fall some tears at the relation notwithstanding the thoughts which arose in his mind at the prospect of being married to his mistress but when fetnah informed him that they were actually in bagdad and in the same house with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6831,1594-135914-0109,the syndic himself and his wife were so moved at the spectacle that they could not forbear weeping nor sufficiently admire the secret workings of providence which had brought together into their house four persons whom fortune had so cruelly persecuted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6832,1594-135914-0110,when they had dried up their tears ganem drew them afresh by the recital of what he had suffered from the day he left fetnah till the moment the syndic brought him to his house he told them that having taken refuge in a small village he there fell sick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6865,3607-135982-0014,decidedly villona was in excellent spirits he kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road the frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6866,3607-135982-0015,this was not altogether pleasant for him as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind besides villona's humming would confuse anybody the noise of the car too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6867,3607-135982-0016,rapid motion through space elates one so does notoriety so does the possession of money these were three good reasons for jimmy's excitement he had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these continentals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6868,3607-135982-0017,at the control segouin had presented him to one of the french competitors and in answer to his confused murmur of compliment the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6869,3607-135982-0018,it was pleasant after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks then as to money he really had a great sum under his control,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6870,3607-135982-0019,but jimmy who in spite of temporary errors was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together this knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6871,3607-135982-0020,and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance it was a serious thing for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6872,3607-135982-0021,jimmy had a respect for his father's shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment money to be made in the motor business pots of money moreover segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6873,3607-135982-0022,jimmy set out to translate into days work that lordly car in which he sat how smoothly it ran in what style they had come careering along the country roads the journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6874,3607-135982-0023,and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal they drove down dame street the street was busy with unusual traffic loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram drivers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6875,3607-135982-0024,near the bank segouin drew up and jimmy and his friend alighted a little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor the party was to dine together that evening in segouin's hotel and meanwhile jimmy and his friend who was staying with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6876,3607-135982-0025,were to go home to dress the car steered out slowly for grafton street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers they walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise while the city hung its pale globes of light above them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6877,3607-135982-0026,in a haze of summer evening in jimmy's house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion a certain pride mingled with his parents trepidation a certain eagerness also to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6878,3607-135982-0027,and as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable his father therefore was unusually friendly with villona,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6879,3607-135982-0028,and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the hungarian who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner the dinner was excellent exquisite,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6880,3607-135982-0029,segouin jimmy decided had a very refined taste the party was increased by a young englishman named routh whom jimmy had seen with segouin at cambridge the young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6881,3607-135982-0030,they talked volubly and with little reserve jimmy whose imagination was kindling conceived the lively youth of the frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the englishman's manner a graceful image of his he thought and a just one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6882,3607-135982-0031,he admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation the five young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened villona with immense respect began to discover to the mildly surprised englishman the beauties of the english madrigal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6883,3607-135982-0032,riviere not wholly ingenuously undertook to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french mechanicians the resonant voice of the hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6884,3607-135982-0033,when segouin shepherded his party into politics here was congenial ground for all jimmy under generous influences felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him he aroused the torpid routh at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6885,3607-135982-0034,the room grew doubly hot and segouin's task grew harder each moment there was even danger of personal spite the alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to humanity and when the toast had been drunk he threw open a window significantly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6886,3607-135982-0035,that night the city wore the mask of a capital the five young men strolled along stephen's green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke they talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders the people made way for them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6887,3607-135982-0036,at the corner of grafton street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party andre it's farley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6888,3607-135982-0037,a torrent of talk followed farley was an american no one knew very well what the talk was about villona and riviere were the noisiest but all the men were excited they got up on a car squeezing themselves together amid much laughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6892,3607-135982-0041,villona said with conviction it is delightful there was a yacht piano in the cabin villona played a waltz for farley and riviere farley acting as cavalier and riviere as lady,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6893,3607-135982-0042,then an impromptu square dance the men devising original figures what merriment jimmy took his part with a will this was seeing life at least then farley got out of breath and cried stop,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6896,3607-135982-0045,the table was cleared villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them the other men played game after game flinging themselves boldly into the adventure they drank the health of the queen of hearts and of the queen of diamonds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6897,3607-135982-0046,jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience the wit was flashing play ran very high and paper began to pass jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing but it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6899,3607-135982-0048,it was a terrible game they stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck jimmy understood that the game lay between routh and segouin what excitement jimmy was excited too he would lose of course how much had he written away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

6923,3607-29116-0020,but he is right at heart his term expires next year and i fear we shall lose him he seemed to be packing the day i was there his rooms were full of dry goods boxes into which his servant was crowding all manner of old clothes and stuff,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6924,3607-29116-0021,i suppose he will paint pub docs on them and frank them home that's good economy isn't it yes yes but child all congressmen do that it may not be strictly honest indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in with the clothes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6925,3607-29116-0022,it's a funny world good bye uncle i'm going to see that chairman and humming a cheery opera air she departed to her room to dress for going out before she did that however she took out her note book and was soon deep in its contents marking dashing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6926,3607-29116-0023,erasing figuring and talking to herself free i wonder what dilworthy does think of me anyway one two eight seventeen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6927,3607-29116-0024,wouldn't dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some of the things balloon did say to me there hopperson's influence ought to count twenty the sanctimonious old curmudgeon son in law sinecure in the negro institution that about gauges him the three committeemen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6928,3607-29116-0025,sons in law nothing like a son in law here in washington or a brother in law and everybody has em let's see sixty one with places twenty five persuaded it is getting on we'll have two thirds of congress in time dilworthy must surely know i understand him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6929,3607-29116-0026,uncle dilworthy uncle balloon tells very amusing stories when ladies are not present i should think so m m eighty five there i must find that chairman queer buckstone acts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6930,3607-29116-0027,seemed to be in love i was sure of it he promised to come here and he hasn't strange very strange i must chance to meet him to day laura dressed and went out thinking she was perhaps too early for mister buckstone to come from the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6931,3607-29116-0028,but as he lodged near the bookstore she would drop in there and keep a look out for him while laura is on her errand to find mister buckstone it may not be out of the way to remark that she knew quite as much of washington life as senator dilworthy gave her credit for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6932,3607-29116-0029,and more than she thought proper to tell him she was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young fellows of newspaper row and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual advantage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6933,3607-29116-0030,they were always talking in the row everlastingly gossiping bantering and sarcastically praising things and going on in a style which was a curious commingling of earnest and persiflage colonel sellers liked this talk amazingly though he was sometimes a little at sea in it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6934,3607-29116-0031,and perhaps that didn't lessen the relish of the conversation to the correspondents it seems that they had got hold of the dry goods box packing story about balloon one day and were talking it over when the colonel came in the colonel wanted to know all about it and hicks told him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6935,3607-29116-0032,and then hicks went on with a serious air colonel if you register a letter it means that it is of value doesn't it and if you pay fifteen cents for registering it the government will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it is lost isn't that so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6936,3607-29116-0033,yes i suppose it's so well senator balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those seven huge boxes of old clothes and shipped that ton of second hand rubbish old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as registered matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6937,3607-29116-0034,it was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch of humor about it too i think there is more real talent among our public men of to day than there was among those of old times a far more fertile fancy a much happier ingenuity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6938,3607-29116-0035,now colonel can you picture jefferson or washington or john adams franking their wardrobes through the mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government responsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents statesmen were dull creatures in those days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6939,3607-29116-0036,i have a much greater admiration for senator balloon yes balloon is a man of parts there is no denying it i think so he is spoken of for the post of minister to china or austria and i hope will be appointed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6940,3607-29116-0037,what we want abroad is good examples of the national character john jay and benjamin franklin were well enough in their day but the nation has made progress since then balloon is a man we know and can depend on to be true to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6941,3607-29116-0038,yes and balloon has had a good deal of public experience he is an old friend of mine he was governor of one of the territories a while and was very satisfactory indeed he was he was ex officio indian agent too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6942,3607-29116-0039,whose land had been taken from them by the white man in the interests of civilization but balloon knew their needs better he built a government saw mill on the reservation with the money and the lumber sold for enormous prices a relative of his did all the work free of charge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6943,3607-29116-0040,that is to say he charged nothing more than the lumber would bring but the poor injuns not that i care much for injuns what did he do for them gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with governor balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor indians but balloon is not alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6944,3607-29116-0041,we have many truly noble statesmen in our country's service like balloon the senate is full of them don't you think so colonel well i dunno i honor my country's public servants as much as any one can i meet them sir every day and the more i see of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6945,3607-29116-0042,of securing their services few lands are so blest that is true colonel to be sure you can buy now and then a senator or a representative but they do not know it is wrong and so they are not ashamed of it they are gentle and confiding and childlike,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6946,3607-29116-0043,and in my opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6947,3607-29116-0044,i quite agree with you colonel sellers well hesitated the colonel i am afraid some of them do buy their seats yes i am afraid they do but as senator dilworthy himself said to me it is sinful it is very wrong it is shameful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6948,3607-29116-0045,heaven protect me from such a charge that is what dilworthy said and yet when you come to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the services of some of our ablest men sir if the country were opposed to to bribery it is a harsh term i do not like to use it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6949,412-126975-0000,the flying stars the most beautiful crime i ever committed flambeau would say in his highly moral old age,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6950,412-126975-0001,was also by a singular coincidence my last it was committed at christmas as an artist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6951,412-126975-0002,i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe as if for a statuary group,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6952,412-126975-0003,thus squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak while jews on the other hand should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6953,412-126975-0004,among the lights and screens of the cafe riche thus in england if i wished to relieve a dean of his riches which is not so easy as you might suppose i wished to frame him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6954,412-126975-0005,if i make myself clear in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral town similarly in france when i had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6955,412-126975-0006,which is almost impossible it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars and those solemn plains of gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of millet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6956,412-126975-0007,well my last crime was a christmas crime a cheery cosy english middle class crime a crime of charles dickens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6957,412-126975-0008,i did it in a good old middle class house near putney a house with a crescent of carriage drive a house with a stable by the side of it a house with the name on the two outer gates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6958,412-126975-0009,a house with a monkey tree enough you know the species i really think my imitation of dickens's style was dexterous and literary it seems almost a pity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6959,412-126975-0010,i repented the same evening flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside and even from the inside it was odd seen from the outside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6960,412-126975-0011,it was perfectly incomprehensible and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it from this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6961,412-126975-0012,opened on the garden with the monkey tree and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6962,412-126975-0013,but her figure was beyond conjecture for she was so wrapped up in brown furs that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur but for the attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6963,412-126975-0014,the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds filling them as it were with the ghosts of the dead roses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6964,412-126975-0015,on one side of the house stood the stable on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind the young lady having scattered bread for the birds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6965,412-126975-0016,for the fourth or fifth time that day because the dog ate it passed unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation of evergreens behind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6966,412-126975-0017,here she gave an exclamation of wonder real or ritual and looking up at the high garden wall above her beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6967,412-126975-0018,oh don't jump mister crook she called out in some alarm it's much too high the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6968,412-126975-0019,was a tall angular young man with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush intelligent and even distinguished lineaments but a sallow and almost alien complexion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6969,412-126975-0020,this showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie the only part of his costume of which he seemed to take any care perhaps it was a symbol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6970,412-126975-0021,he took no notice of the girl's alarmed adjuration but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her where he might very well have broken his legs i think i was meant to be a burglar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6971,412-126975-0022,he said placidly and i have no doubt i should have been if i hadn't happened to be born in that nice house next door i can't see any harm in it anyhow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6972,412-126975-0023,how can you say such things she remonstrated well said the young man if you're born on the wrong side of the wall i can't see that it's wrong to climb over it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6973,412-126975-0024,i never know what you will say or do next she said i don't often know myself replied mister crook but then i am on the right side of the wall now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6974,412-126975-0025,and which is the right side of the wall asked the young lady smiling whichever side you are on said the young man named crook,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6975,412-126975-0026,as they went together through the laurels towards the front garden a motor horn sounded thrice coming nearer and nearer and a car of splendid speed great elegance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6976,412-126975-0027,and stood throbbing hullo hullo said the young man with the red tie here's somebody born on the right side anyhow i didn't know miss adams that your santa claus was so modern as this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6977,412-126975-0028,oh that's my godfather sir leopold fischer he always comes on boxing day then after an innocent pause which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6978,412-126975-0029,ruby adams added he is very kind john crook journalist had heard of that eminent city magnate and it was not his fault if the city magnate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
6979,412-126975-0030,had not heard of him for in certain articles in the clarion or the new age sir leopold had been dealt with austerely but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motor car,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7083,6064-56165-0000,he was a harvard sophomore and realized his own importance quite as much as the girls did but still there was always the chance that he would come into the room just for a minute and tell them some of the latest cambridge news,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7086,6064-56165-0003,and he would grow almost enthusiastic when describing the tussle between ned brown and stanley hooper over the respective merits of boston and new york in which hooper the new yorker was terribly beaten and upon my word he concluded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7093,6064-56165-0010,philip looked over his shoulder in the glass there was nothing the matter with his own shapely nose and i doubt that he would have run any such risk as edith suggested perhaps this was the reason why philip was not a fighter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7094,6064-56165-0011,there was one good thing about the little disputes in which brenda and belle indulged they very seldom lasted long in the present instance the girls were ashamed of having shown temper before philip,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7098,6064-56165-0015,oh it gives a fellow a chance to show what kind of stuff he's made of explained philip whether he has good manners and whether he's clever and all that there must be better ways of showing bravery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7101,6064-56165-0018,he walked off as nice as you please wasn't he mad at the two fellows for taking him there of course not that's a part of the thing why there are fellows in cambridge who would go through fire and water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7103,6064-56165-0020,although he had belonged to the illustrious organization a very short time well i think you're perfectly horrid cried brenda i mean the dicky i've heard about the way you make people suffer branding them with hot cigars and making them run barefoot winter nights and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7104,6064-56165-0021,there are a lot of girls studying in cambridge now at the annex and the fellows don't like it at all well i declare exclaimed nora i'd like to know what difference it makes to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7105,6064-56165-0022,oh they hate to see these girls going about with books and trying to get into harvard yes trying to break down the walls said nora sarcastically,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7106,6064-56165-0023,oh see here it would just spoil everything to have women in the classes with us are you afraid they'd get ahead of you asked edith gently now look here edith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7107,6064-56165-0024,interrupted philip i've heard that some professors say that their annex classes do better work than ours but anybody can tell that that's all rot i believe it's all perfectly true said nora,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7108,6064-56165-0025,well i wish myself that our english instructor hadn't such a fondness for reading themes to us that the girls have written he makes out that they are better than ours but i can't say that i see it myself who gets the best marks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7109,6064-56165-0026,does julia wear glasses or look green i beg your pardon brenda no she doesn't said nora shortly she's about the nicest girl i know oh she is lovely added edith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7110,6064-56165-0027,a matter of opinion murmured belle under her breath you don't mean to say you haven't seen her cried brenda in surprise no i haven't happened to answered philip,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7111,6064-56165-0028,she's invited to my cooking party next week said nora you know that you've accepted too so you'll see her oh yes by the way said philip what evening is it friday of course replied nora,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7112,6064-56165-0029,so we can sit up late without thinking about school the next day well you'll see me sure said philip but see here it's five o'clock now and i have an engagement down town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7113,6064-56165-0030,philip hurried off bowing in a very grown up way to the group of girls for whatever criticisms any one might make about philip's indolence and disinclination to study no one could deny that he had very good manners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7114,6064-56165-0031,though only about four years their senior he seemed much older than brenda and her friends years before they had all been playmates together but his two years in college had taken him away from them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7115,6064-56165-0032,and it was not often that he condescended to spend as long a time in their presence as had been the case this afternoon do you think that philip looks very well edith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7116,6064-56165-0033,replied philip's sister it seemed to me he was just a little pale he is always pale said edith do you suppose he sits up too late asked brenda i'll warrant he doesn't study too much said belle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7117,6064-56165-0034,how can you criticise edith's brother don't let her do it edith it doesn't trouble me answered the placid edith i know all about philip and he's good enough for me that's right said nora,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7118,6064-56165-0035,he says there are two or three fellows just sponging off of philip all the time and philip is too good natured to say anything i wonder how he'll like julia said edith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7119,6064-56165-0036,hastily interposed belle boys never like a girl who studies especially one who is going to college well julia is just the nicest girl i know said nora repeating the words she had used to philip,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7120,6064-56168-0000,for a week before thanksgiving there was great excitement among the schoolgirls on account of the approaching football game the four were as excited as the others although not so many of their own particular friends were in the harvard team,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7121,6064-56168-0001,it was to be a game with princeton one of the great university matches and for special reasons there was the deepest interest in the match those girls who had brothers in college or even cousins or friends held themselves with more dignity than any of the others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7122,6064-56168-0002,and those who had relatives in the team were too proud for anything as brenda said the game was to be played in holmes field and tickets were not easy to get because the seats were far less numerous than now on the great soldiers field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7123,6064-56168-0003,the girls were making up little groups to go to the game with youths of their acquaintance as escorts under the chaperonage of older people a few who had received no invitation were especially miserable and took no trouble to disguise their feelings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7124,6064-56168-0004,who had not been invited elsewhere to go in some other party now edith was of a generally generous disposition and not inclined to limit her favors of whatever nature to any particular set of girls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7125,6064-56168-0005,and even occasionally from brenda both of whom were inclined to be more exclusive so it happened that the general harmony of the four was somewhat disturbed when nora one day at recess exclaimed who do you suppose is going with us to the game,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7126,6064-56168-0006,for of course in the minds of the others there could be but one game,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7127,6064-56168-0007,why who is it cried brenda and who is it echoed belle i know that you can't guess oh don't be silly nora it wouldn't be worth while to guess about something you'll know all about so soon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7128,6064-56168-0008,except that you speak as if it were some one we might not care to have and if that's the case i declare it's too bad said belle if it's anything like that broke in brenda rather snappishly i will just tell edith what i think,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7129,6064-56168-0009,it that cried nora didn't i say that it was a person a girl if i must be more definite ruth roberts if i must tell just who it is oh cried belle and ah echoed brenda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7130,6064-56168-0010,you need not look so surprised rejoined nora and if you take my advice you will not say anything to edith she ought to have her own way in arranging her own party and you know when she makes up her mind it is of no use to talk to her about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7131,6064-56168-0011,it's hard enough to have julia tagging about everywhere but why in the world we should have ruth roberts when we never see her anywhere except at school i really cannot understand and i don't see how you and nora can like it either why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7132,6064-56168-0012,ruth roberts is as pleasant a girl as there is in school and yet she would have a terribly lonely time if it were not for edith and julia nobody else ever thinks of speaking to her well why should we,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7133,6064-56168-0013,yes that's what i think too nora smiled pleasantly and her eyes looked brighter than ever under the rim of her brown felt hat with its trimmings of lighter brown nora's temper was not easily ruffled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7134,6064-56168-0014,then belle added a final word oh it's clear that this is all julia's doings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7135,6064-56168-0015,but i don't see turning rather snappishly towards brenda why the rest of us have got to take up ruth roberts just because your cousin julia is so devoted to her now this was a little too much even for brenda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7136,6064-56168-0016,and anyway i'm thankful to have julia take a fancy to anybody it leaves us a great deal freer to do as we like i should think that you would see that yourself oh well said nora laughing the whole thing is not worth quarreling about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7137,6064-56168-0017,yes i know but still the least said the soonest mended said nora though to tell you the truth the quotation did not sound especially appropriate the least said the soonest mended,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7138,6064-56168-0018,i am going to carry an orange scarf and perhaps an orange flag what for why i never heard of such a thing exclaimed nora nor i cried brenda at a harvard game,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7139,6064-56168-0019,i should call it very impolite if there were no orange flags shown at the game well you have the most ridiculous ideas hasn't she brenda brenda nodded assent and nora continued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7140,6064-56168-0020,why it's a duty to do everything you can to help your own side i never said that harvard was my side interrupted belle didn't i tell you that i have a cousin on the princeton team you'd better not say anything of that kind to philip,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7141,6064-56168-0021,or to edith either they are both perfectly devoted to harvard and they expect their party to give great encouragement to the harvard team why belle i cannot imagine your doing anything else i'm not a child responded belle very crossly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7142,6064-56168-0022,walking away from nora and brenda i do not need to be told what to do what nora or brenda might have answered i cannot say for hardly had belle disappeared within the house when edith herself appeared with julia and ruth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7143,6064-56168-0023,ruth was a pretty and amiable girl about julia's age and therefore a little older than the four she had been in the school for two years before the coming of julia but in all that time she had had only a speaking acquaintance with the other girls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7144,6064-56168-0024,that they were very selfish in leaving their schoolmate so entirely to herself it was not because they did not like her they were merely so very much wrapped up in their own affairs that they hardly noticed that she was often left to herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7145,6064-56168-0025,ruth lived in the suburbs and as belle had said outside of school the other girls seldom saw her at recess each little group had so many personal things to talk about that an outsider would have been decidedly in the way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7146,6064-56168-0026,and would perhaps have been a little uncomfortable in joining them no one gets a great deal of enjoyment from reading a single chapter in the middle of a book and so it is often hard to be a mere listener,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7147,6064-56168-0027,when the tongues of half a dozen girls are vigorously discussing people and events of which the listener has not the slightest knowledge ruth herself was very independent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7148,6064-56168-0028,she had acquired the habit of studying during recess since after school she spent more time than most girls of her age in outdoor sports it did her no great harm to pass the half hour of recess in this way ruth as well as julia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7149,6064-56168-0029,had undertaken to prepare for college and it had been a great delight to her to have the latter placed with her in one or two special classes julia's liking for her had made edith take a little more interest in her than would otherwise have been the case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7150,6064-56168-0030,no one who saw the hearty way in which nora and brenda greeted ruth as she came up with edith and julia could for a moment have imagined that she had been under discussion the mercurial brenda for the moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7151,6064-56168-0031,was so annoyed by belle's proposed championship of princeton that she was unexpectedly cordial to ruth and almost to her own surprise found herself urging ruth to come to town early on the saturday of the game to take luncheon with her and julia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7152,6064-56168-0032,the latter expressed her thanks in a glance towards her cousin as ruth accepted very gracefully and nora exclaimed what fun we are going to have,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7153,6064-56168-0033,oh dear i can hardly wait for saturday i know it replied brenda it's less than a week too but it seems an awfully long time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7154,6272-70191-0000,we sat in state to be condoled with and waited upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7155,6272-70191-0001,though i am sure the performers thereof had small encouragement veronica alone would see no one her room was the only one not invaded for the neighbors took the house into their hands assisted by that part of the morgesons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7156,6272-70191-0002,who were too distantly related to consider themselves as mourners to be shut up with us it was put under rigorous funeral law and inspected from garret to cellar they supervised all the arrangements,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7157,6272-70191-0003,her course was taken for granted mine was imposed upon me i remonstrated with temperance but she replied that it was all well meant and always done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7158,6272-70191-0004,i endured the same annoyances over and over again from relays of people bed time especially was their occasion i was not allowed to undress alone i must have drinks either to compose or stimulate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7159,6272-70191-0005,they reiterated the character the peculiarities the virtues of the mother i had lost who could never be replaced who was in a better world however i was in a measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7160,6272-70191-0006,kept from myself during this interval the matter is often subservient to the manner arthur's feelings were played upon also he wept often confiding to me his grief and his plans for the future,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7161,6272-70191-0007,things would go well he said for everybody must expect to die then the bible says so he informed me also that he expected to be an architect and that mother liked it he had an idea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7163,6272-70191-0009,for meals were prepared at all hours for comers and goers temperance told me that the mild and indifferent mourners were fond of good victuals and she thought their hearts were lighter than their stomachs when they went away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7164,6272-70191-0010,because he looked so grief struck aunt merce was engaged with a dressmaker and with the orders for bonnets and veils she discussed the subject of the mourning with the morgesons i acquiesced in all her arrangements,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7165,6272-70191-0011,for she derived a simple comfort from these external tokens veronica refused to wear the bonnet and veil and the required bombazine bombazine made her flesh crawl why should she wear it mother hated it too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7179,6272-70191-0025,they seemed to fall on the coffin in dull strife with its inmate who mutely contradicted them a discourse followed which was calculated to harrow the feelings to the utmost arthur began to cry so nervously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7180,6272-70191-0026,that some considerate friend took him out and aunt merce wept so violently that she grew faint and caught hold of me i gave her the flacon of salts which revived her but i felt as father looked stern,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7181,6272-70191-0027,and anxious to escape the unprofitable trial as the coffin was taken out to the hearse my heart twisted and palpitated as if a command had been laid upon it to follow and not leave her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7182,6272-70191-0028,when the hearse moved down the street father arthur and i were called and assisted in our own chaise as if we were helpless the reins were put in father's hands and the horse was led behind the hearse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7183,6272-70191-0029,at last the word was given and the long procession began to move through the street which was deserted a cat ran out of a house and scampered across the way arthur laughed and father jumped nervously at the sound of his laugh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7184,6272-70191-0030,the graveyard was a mile outside the village a sandy plain where a few stunted pines transplanted from the woods near it struggled to keep alive as we turned from the street into the lane which led to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7185,6272-70191-0031,and rode up a little hill where the sand was so deep that it muffled the wheels and feet of the horses the whole round of the gray sky was visible it hung low over us i wished it to drop and blot out the vague nothings under it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7186,6272-70191-0032,we left the carriage at the palings and walked up the narrow path among the mounds where every stone was marked morgeson some so old that they were stained with blotches of yellow moss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7187,6272-70191-0033,slanting backward and forward in protest against the folly of indicating what was no longer beneath them the mounds were covered with mats of scanty tangled grass with here and there a rank spot of green,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7188,6272-70191-0034,it was the custom and father took his hat off to thank his friends for their sympathy and attention his lips moved but no words were audible the procession moved down the path again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7189,6272-70191-0035,arthur's hand was in mine he stamped his feet firmly on the sand as if to break the oppressive silence which no one seemed disposed to disturb the same ceremonies were performed in starting us homeward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7190,6272-70191-0036,but not a soul was there when we went in the duties of friendship and tradition had been fulfilled the neighbors had gone home to their avocations for the public the tragedy was over all speculation on the degree of our grief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7191,6272-70191-0037,or our indifference was settled we could take off our mourning garments and our mourning countenance now that we were alone or we could give way to that anguish we are afraid and ashamed to show except before the one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7192,6272-70168-0000,instead of my heart leaping for joy as i had expected a sudden indifference filled it i felt averse to the change from the narrow ways of barmouth which for the moment i regretted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7269,8465-246942-0000,she had sought the door of paradise and the door of hell had been opened to her if the frightful idea which she did not doubt had already suggested itself to leopold should now be encouraged there was nothing but black madness before her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7272,8465-246942-0003,helen's only knowledge of guilt came from the pale image of it lifted above her horizon by the refraction of her sympathy she did not know perhaps never would understand the ghastly horror of conscious guilt besides which there is no evil else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7273,8465-246942-0004,agonies of injury a man may endure and so far from being overwhelmed rise above them tenfold a man who were he to awake to the self knowledge of a crime would sink into a heap of ruin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7275,8465-246942-0006,helen did not know to what gulfs of personal shame nay to what summits of public execration a man may be glad to flee for refuge from the fangs of home born guilt if so be there is any refuge to be found in either,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7276,8465-246942-0007,and some kind of refuge there does seem to be strange it is and true that in publicity itself lies some relief from the gnawing of the worm as if even a cursing humanity were a barrier of protection between the torn soul and its crime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7277,8465-246942-0008,it flees to its kind for shelter from itself hence i imagine in part may the coolness of some criminals be accounted for their quietness is the relief brought by confession even confession but to their fellows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7278,8465-246942-0009,is it that the crime seems then lifted a little from their shoulders and its weight shared by the ace helen had hoped that the man who had spoken in public so tenderly and at the same time so powerfully of the saving heart of the universe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7281,8465-246942-0012,and make him feel that after all there was yet a place for him in the universe and that he was no outcast of gehenna but instead of such words of gentle might like those of the man of whom he was so fond of talking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7282,8465-246942-0013,he had only spoken drearily of duty hinting at a horror that would plunge the whole ancient family into a hell of dishonour and contempt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7283,8465-246942-0014,skeletons they were and no human beings at all her father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7284,8465-246942-0015,if leopold had had her mother for his too instead of the dark skinned woman with the flashing eyes he would never have brought this upon them it was all his mother's fault the fault of her race and of the horrible drug her people had taught him to take,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7285,8465-246942-0016,and was he to go and confess it and be tried for it and be great god and here was the priest actually counselling what was worse than any suicide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7286,8465-246942-0017,suddenly however it occurred to her that the curate had had no knowledge of the facts of the case and had therefore been compelled to talk at random it was impossible he should suspect the crime of which her brother had been guilty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7287,8465-246942-0018,and therefore could not know the frightful consequences of such a confession as he had counselled had she not better then tell him all and so gather from him some right and reasonable advice for the soothing of the agonies of her poor broken winged angel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7288,8465-246942-0019,but alas what security had she that a man capable of such priestly seveirity and heartlessness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7289,8465-246942-0020,no she would venture no farther sooner would she go to george bascombe from whom she not only could look for no spiritual comfort but whose theories were so cruel against culprits of all sorts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7290,8465-246942-0021,alas alas she was alone absolutely alone in the great waste death eyed universe but for a man to talk so of the tenderness of jesus christ,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7291,8465-246942-0022,and then serve her as the curate had done it was indeed shameless he would never have treated a poor wretched woman like that and as she said thus to herself again the words sounded in the ear of her heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7292,8465-246942-0023,come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest whence came the voice from her memory or from that inner chamber of the spirit which the one spirit bearing spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7293,8465-246942-0024,keeps for his own in every house that he builds alas so long in most human houses shut away from the rest of the rooms and forgotten or recollected with uneasiness as a lumber closet in which lie too many things that had better not be looked into,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7294,8465-246942-0025,but what matter where the voice that had said them so long as the words were true and she might believe them whatever is true can be believed of the true heart ere she knew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7295,8465-246942-0026,helen was on her knees with her head on the chair yet once more crying to the hearer of cries possible or impossible being she knew not in the least but words reported of him had given birth to the cry to help her in her dire need,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7296,8465-246942-0027,instead of any word or thought even coming to her that might be fancied an answer she was scared from her knees by an approaching step,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7297,8465-246943-0000,helen rose and hastened to her brother with a heart of lead in her body she started when she saw him some change had passed on him since the morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7298,8465-246943-0001,that glimmer on his countenance doubtful as the first of the morning when the traveller knows not whether the light be in the sky or only in his brain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7299,8465-246943-0002,but at the same time he appeared more wasted and pinched and death like than she had yet seen him or was it only in her eyes was she but reading in his face the agony she had herself gone through that day helen helen he cried as she entered the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7300,8465-246943-0003,what was that poldie asked helen with a pang of fear why those words of course what else you sang them to me afterwards you know helen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7301,8465-246943-0004,don't you think he might be able to do something,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7302,8465-246943-0005,was this what came of praying she thought bitterly something or other i don't know what exactly returned leopold oh helen he broke out with a cry stifled by the caution that had grown habitual to both of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7303,8465-246943-0006,is there no help of any kind anywhere surely mister wingfold could tell me something comfort me somehow if i were to tell him all about it i could trust the man that said such things as those you told me that i could,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7304,8465-246943-0007,oh i wish i hadn't run away but had let them take me and hang me helen felt herself grow white she turned away and pretended to search for something she had dropped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7305,8465-246943-0008,i don't think he would be of the slightest use to you she said still stooping and she felt like a devil dragging the soul of her brother to hell but that was a foolish fancy and must be resisted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7306,8465-246943-0009,not if i told him everything leopold hissed from between his teeth in the struggle to keep down a shriek no not if you told him everything she answered and felt like a judge condemning him to death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7307,8465-246943-0010,what is he there for then said leopold indignantly and turned his face to the wall and moaned helen had not yet thought of asking herself whether her love to her brother was all clear love and nowise mingled with selfishness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7308,8465-246943-0011,whether in the fresh horror that day poured into the cup that had seemed already running over it was of her brother only she thought or whether threatened shame to herself had not a part in her misery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7309,8465-246943-0012,for what attempt even had he made to comfort her what had he done but utter common places and truisms about duty and who could tell but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7310,8465-246943-0013,indeed was she not certain that such a man bringing the artillery of his fanaticism to bear upon her poor boy's wild enthusiastic temperament would speedily persuade him to make a reality of that terrible thing he had already thought of that hideously impossible possibility,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7311,8465-246943-0014,it could not have been long she thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7312,8465-246943-0015,apparently senseless on the pillow and she thought he was dead the same moment she was free the horror had departed from her own atmosphere too and she made haste to restore him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7313,8465-246943-0016,but in all she did for him she felt like the executioner who gives restoratives to the wretch that has fainted on the rack or the wheel what right had she she thought to multiply to him his moments of torture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7314,8465-246943-0017,if the cruel power that had created him for such misery whoever whatever wherever he might be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7315,8465-246943-0018,yet she hesitated not a single moment in her ministrations there is so much passes in us of which our consciousness takes no grasp or but with such a flitting touch as scarcely to hand it over to the memory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7316,8465-246943-0019,that i feel encouraged to doubt whether ever there was a man absolutely without hope that there have been alas are many who are aware of no ground of hope nay even who feel no glimmer in them of anything they can call hope i know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7317,8465-246943-0020,but i think in them all is an underlying unconscious hope i think that not one in all the world has more than a shadowy notion of what hopelessness means perhaps utter hopelessness is the outer darkness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7318,8465-246943-0021,at length leopold opened his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7319,8465-246943-0022,nonsense dear poldie it was all fancy nothing more she returned in a voice almost as hollow as his and the lightness of the words uttered in such a tone jarred dismayfully on her own ear fancy he repeated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7320,8465-246943-0023,i know what fancy is as well as any man or woman born that was no fancy she stood there by the wardrobe in the same dress her face as white as her dress and listen i will tell you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7321,8465-246943-0024,i will soon satisfy you it could be no fancy here he pushed her from him and looked straight in her eyes i saw her back reflected in the mirror of the wardrobe door and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7322,8465-246943-0025,here the fixed look of horror threatened to return upon his face but he went on listen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7323,8465-246943-0026,ugh i saw it in the mirror his voice had risen to a strangled shriek his face was distorted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7324,8465-246943-0027,if indeed that be a possible source of courage and it is not gathered rather from the hidden hope of which i speak and the love that will cleave and not forsake she set her teeth and said let her come then poldie i am with you and i defy her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7325,8465-246943-0028,she shall know that a sister's love is stronger than the hate of a jilt even if you did kill her before god poldie i would after all rather be you than she say what you will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7326,8465-246943-0029,but leopold seemed not to hear a word she said and lay with his face to the wall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7327,8465-246940-0000,it was some moments before either of them spoke and it did not help wingfold that she sat clouded by a dark coloured veil at length he said you must not fear to trust me because i doubt my ability to help you i can at least assure you of my sympathy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7328,8465-246940-0001,can you tell me she said from behind more veils than that of lace how to get rid of a haunting idea that depends on the nature of the idea i should imagine answered the curate such things sometimes arise merely from the state of the health,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7329,8465-246940-0002,and there the doctor is the best help helen shook her head and smiled behind her veil a grievous smile the curate paused but receiving no assistance ventured on again if it be a thought of something past and gone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7330,8465-246940-0003,for which nothing can be done i think activity in one's daily work must be the best aid to endurance oh dear oh dear sighed helen when one has no heart to endure and hates the very sunlight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7331,8465-246940-0004,you wouldn't talk about work to a man dying of hunger would you i'm not sure about that he wouldn't heed you perhaps not what would you do then give him some food and try him again i think,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7332,8465-246940-0005,then give me some food some hope i mean and try me again without that i don't care about duty or life or anything tell me then what is the matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7333,8465-246940-0006,i may be able to hint at some hope said wingfold very gently do you call yourself a christian the question would to most people have sounded strange abrupt inquisitorial but to helen it sounded not one of them all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7334,8465-246940-0007,no she answered ah said the curate a little sadly and went on because then i could have said you know where to go for comfort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7335,8465-246940-0008,might it not be well however to try if there is any to be had from him that said come unto me and i will give you rest i can do nothing with that i have tried and tried to pray but it is of no use,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7336,8465-246940-0009,i suppose it is because i cannot believe there is anyone hearing a word i say yesterday when i got alone in the park i prayed aloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7337,8465-246940-0010,i thought that perhaps even if he might not be able to read what was in my heart he might be able to hear my voice i was even foolish enough to wish i knew greek because perhaps he would understand me better if i were to pray in greek,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7338,8465-246940-0011,she tried hard but could not prevent a sob,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7339,8465-246940-0012,will you not tell me something about it said the curate yet more gently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7340,8465-246940-0013,his help may be on the way to you or even with you only you do not recognize it for what it is i have known that kind of thing tell me some fact or some feeling i can lay hold of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7341,8465-246940-0014,possibly there is something you ought to do and are not doing and that is why you cannot rest i think jesus would give no rest except in the way of learning of him helen's sobs ceased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7342,8465-246940-0015,but what appeared to the curate a long silence followed at length she said with faltering voice suppose it were a great wrong that had been done and that was the unendurable thought suppose i say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7343,8465-246940-0016,that was what made me miserable then you must of course make all possible reparation answered wingfold at once but if none were possible what then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7344,8465-246940-0017,here the answer was not so plain and the curate had to think at least he said at length you could confess the wrong and ask forgiveness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7345,8465-246940-0018,again the curate took time to reply i am endeavouring to answer your questions as well as i can he said but it is hard to deal with generalities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7346,8465-246940-0019,you see how useless for that very reason my answers have as yet been still i have something more to say and hesitate only because it may imply more confidence than i dare profess and of all things i dread untruth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7347,8465-246940-0020,for surely there cannot be any other kind of god than the father of jesus christ,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7348,8465-246940-0021,therefore surely the first step for anyone who has committed such a crime must be to humble himself before god confess the sin and ask forgiveness and cleansing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7349,8465-246940-0022,and the creature he has made and if god heard the man's prayer and forgave him then the man would certainly know it in his heart and be consoled perhaps by the gift of humility,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7350,8465-246940-0023,then you think confession to god is all that is required if there be no one else wronged to whom confession can be made if the case were mine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7351,8465-246940-0024,and sometimes i much fear that in taking holy orders i have grievously sinned i should then do just as i have done with regard to that cry to the living power which i think originated me to set the matter right for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7352,8465-246940-0025,then to forgive and console me alas alas that he will not hear of he would rather be punished than consoled i fear for his brain but indeed that might be well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7353,8465-246940-0026,she had gone much farther than she had intended but the more doubtful help became the more she was driven by the agony of a perishing hope to search the heart of wingfold again the curate pondered are you sure he said at length,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7354,8465-246940-0027,that the person of whom you speak is not neglecting something he ought to do something he knows perhaps he had come back to the same with which he started through her veil he saw her turn deadly white,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7355,8465-246940-0028,ever since leopold said the word jury a ghastly fear had haunted helen she pressed her hand on her heart and made no answer i speak from experience the curate went on from what else could i speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7356,8465-246940-0029,i know that so long as we hang back from doing what conscience urges there is no peace for us i will not say our prayers are not heard for mister polwarth has taught me that the most precious answer prayer can have,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7357,8465-246940-0030,lies in the growing strength of the impulse towards the dreaded duty and in the ever sharper stings of the conscience i think i asked already whether there were no relatives to whom reparation could be made yes yes gasped helen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7358,8465-246940-0031,and i told you reparation was impossible her voice had sunk almost to a groan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7359,8465-246947-0000,as wingfold came out of the room which was near the stair helen rose from the top of it where she had been sitting all the time he had been with her brother he closed the door gently behind him and stepped softly along the landing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7360,8465-246947-0001,a human soul in guilt and agony is an awful presence but there was more than that in the hush of the curate he felt as if he had left the physician of souls behind him at the bedside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7361,8465-246947-0002,but at his head stood one who watched his throes with the throbs of such a human heart as never beat in any bosom but his own and the executioners were angels of light no wonder if with such a feeling in his breast wingfold walked softly and his face glistened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7362,8465-246947-0003,he was not aware that the tears stood in his eyes but helen saw them you know all she faltered i do will you let me out by the garden again i wish to be alone she led the way down the stair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7363,8465-246947-0004,and walked with him through the garden wingfold did not speak you don't think very badly of my poor brother do you mister wingfold said helen meekly it is a terrible fate he returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7364,8465-246947-0005,i think i never saw a lovelier disposition i do hope his mind will soon be more composed i think he knows where alone he can find rest i am well aware how foolish that of which i speak seems to some minds miss lingard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7365,8465-246947-0006,but when a man is once overwhelmed in his own deeds when they have turned into spectres to mock at him when he loathes himself and turns with sickness from past present and future i know but one choice left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7366,8465-246947-0007,into the life i hope your brother will enter i am so glad you don't hate him hate him who but a demon could hate him helen lifted a grateful look from eyes that swam in tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7367,8465-246947-0008,the terror of his possible counsel for the moment vanished he could never tell him to give himself up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7368,8465-246947-0009,the dwarf exclaimed helen shuddering at the remembrance of what she had gone through at the cottage yes that man's soul is as grand and beautiful and patient as his body is insignificant and distorted and troubled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7369,8465-246947-0010,he is the wisest and best man i have ever known i must ask leopold returned helen who the better the man was represented felt the more jealous and fearful of the advice he might give,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7370,8465-246947-0011,her love and her conscience were not yet at one with each other they parted at the door from the garden and she returned to the sick room she paused hesitating to enter all was still as the grave she turned the handle softly and peeped in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7371,8465-246947-0012,could it be that wingfold's bearing had communicated to her mind a shadow of the awe with which he had left the place where perhaps a soul was being born again leopold did not move terror laid hold of her heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7372,8465-246947-0013,she stepped quickly in and round the screen to the side of the bed there to her glad surprise he lay fast asleep with the tears not yet dried upon his face her heart swelled with some sense unknown before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7373,8465-246947-0014,was it rudimentary thankfulness to the father of her spirit as she stood gazing with the look of a mother over her sick child he lifted his eyelids and smiled a sad smile when did you come into the room he said a minute ago she answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7374,8465-246947-0015,i did not hear you he returned no you were asleep not i mister wingfold is only just gone i have let him out on the meadow since leopold stared looked half alarmed and then said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7375,8465-246947-0016,did god make me sleep helen she did not answer the light of a new hope in his eye as if the dawn had begun at last to break over the dark mountains was already reflected from her heart oh helen he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7376,8465-246947-0017,that is a good fellow such a good fellow a pang of jealousy the first she had ever felt shot to her heart she had hitherto since his trouble been all in all to her leopold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7377,8465-246947-0018,had the curate been a man she liked she would not perhaps have minded it so much you will be able to do without me now she said sadly i never could understand taking to people at first sight some people are made so i suppose helen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7378,8465-246947-0019,i know i took to you at first sight i shall never forget the first time i saw you when i came to this country a lonely little foreigner and you a great beautiful lady for such you seemed to me though you have told me since you were only a great gawky girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7379,8465-246947-0020,i know that could never have been you ran to meet me and took me in your arms and kissed me i was as if i had crossed the sea of death and found paradise in your bosom i am not likely to forget you for mister wingfold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7380,8465-246947-0021,good and kind and strong as he is even she could not make me forget you helen but neither you nor i can do without mister wingfold any more i fancy i wish you liked him better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7381,8465-246947-0022,but you will in time you see he's not one to pay young ladies compliments as i have heard some parsons do and he may be a little no not unpolished not that that's not what i mean but unornamental in his manners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7382,8465-246947-0023,you know all about him though you never saw him before that is true returned leopold but then he came to me with his door open and let me walk in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7383,8465-246947-0024,he hasn't got a secret like us helen he added sadly what did he say to you much what he said to you from the pulpit the other day i should think then she was right for all his hardness and want of sympathy the curate had yet had regard to her entreaties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7384,8465-246947-0025,and was not going to put any horrid notions about duty and self sacrifice into the poor boy's head he's coming again to morrow added leopold almost gleefully and then perhaps he will tell me more and help me on a bit did he tell you he wants to bring a friend with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7385,8465-246947-0026,no i can't see the good of taking more people into our confidence why should he not do what he thinks best helen you don't interfere with the doctor why should you with him when a man is going to the bottom as fast as he can,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7386,8465-246947-0027,and another comes diving after him it isn't for me to say how he is to take hold of me no helen when i trust i trust out and out helen sighed thinking how ill that had worked with emmeline,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7387,8063-274117-0000,like a kind good housekeeper it was still perfectly dark then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7388,8063-274117-0001,he took by assault porthos's room which was next to his own the worthy porthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder in the dim obscurity of the room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7389,8063-274117-0002,and his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7390,8063-274117-0003,the whole household was already up the cook was mercilessly slaughtering in the poultry yard celestin was gathering white cherries in the garden porthos,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7391,8063-274117-0004,brisk and lively as ever held out his hand to planchet's and d'artagnan requested permission to embrace madame truchen the latter to show that she bore no ill will approached porthos upon whom she conferred the same favor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7392,8063-274117-0005,took both his friends by the hand i am going to show you over the house he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7393,8063-274117-0006,i am a great stickler for a good view myself said porthos,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7394,8063-274117-0007,i have had four avenues laid out and at the end of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7395,8063-274117-0008,and he led his two guests to a window ah said d'artagnan this is the rue de lyon yes i have two windows on this side a paltry insignificant view,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7396,8063-274117-0009,for there is always that bustling and noisy inn which is a very disagreeable neighbor i had four windows here but i bricked up two let us go on said d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7397,8063-274117-0010,it is the horizon a thick line of green which is yellow in the spring green in the summer red in the autumn and white in the winter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7398,8063-274117-0011,i assure you it is very curious hardly a day passes that some one is not buried there for fontainebleau is by no means an inconsiderable place sometimes we see young girls clothed in white carrying banners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7399,8063-274117-0012,and then too we see some of the officers of the king's household i should not like that said porthos there is not much amusement in it at all events said d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7400,8063-274117-0013,if i had any i should be far from rejecting them said planchet but possessing only this little cemetery full of flowers so moss grown shady and quiet i am contented with it and i think of those who live in town in the rue des lombards for instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7401,8063-274117-0014,and who have to listen to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day and to the soulless tramp tramp tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand foot passengers but living said porthos living remember that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7414,8063-274117-0027,it is aramis himself aramis in fact remained alone on that side at least for hardly had he turned his head when a woman's footsteps and the rustling of her dress were heard in the path close to him he immediately turned round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7422,8063-274117-0035,a poor franciscan mendicant friar replied the latter who had not even a dog to love him in this world and to accompany him to his last resting place if that were really the case thought d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7423,8063-274116-0000,the cavaliers looked up and saw that what planchet had announced to them was true ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the rue de lyon on the opposite side of the hostelry of the beau paon a high hedge of bushy elders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7424,8063-274116-0001,hawthorn and wild hops formed an impenetrable fence behind which rose a white house with a high tiled roof,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7425,8063-274116-0002,between the two a small door with a porch supported by a couple of pillars formed the entrance to the house the door was gained by a step raised a little from the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7426,8063-274116-0003,on second thoughts he took hold of his horse by the bridle and led it about thirty paces further on his two companions following him he then advanced about another thirty paces until he arrived at the door of a cart house lighted by an iron grating and lifting up a wooden latch pushed open one of the folding doors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7427,8063-274116-0004,he entered first leading his horse after him by the bridle into a small courtyard where an odor met them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable that smells all right said porthos loudly getting off his horse and i almost begin to think,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7429,8063-274116-0006,in the meantime d'artagnan who had dismounted with his usual agility inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a parisian feels at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7430,8063-274116-0007,porthos clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into the ground and ate or rather browsed upon them shells and all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7431,8063-274116-0008,and dressed in an old stable suit of clothes the peasant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7433,8063-274116-0010,and came out into a little garden behind the house the principal front of which as we have already noticed faced the street as they approached,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7434,8063-274116-0011,this room softly lighted by a lamp placed on the table seemed from the end of the garden like a smiling image of repose comfort and happiness in every direction where the rays of light fell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7435,8063-274116-0012,whether upon a piece of old china or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness or upon the weapons hanging against the wall the soft light was softly reflected and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or another agreeable to the eye the lamp which lighted the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7436,8063-274116-0013,whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the window frames splendidly illuminated a damask table cloth as white as snow the table was laid for two persons amber colored wine sparkled in a long cut glass bottle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7437,8063-274116-0014,near the table in a high backed armchair reclined fast asleep a woman of about thirty years of age her face the very picture of health and freshness upon her knees lay a large cat with her paws folded under her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7438,8063-274116-0015,and her eyes half closed purring in that significant manner which according to feline habits indicates perfect contentment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7439,8063-274116-0016,at the sound of this gigantic voice the cat took flight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7440,8063-274116-0017,introduced his two companions into the room where the table was already laid permit me my dear he said to present to you monsieur le chevalier d'artagnan my patron,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7442,8063-274116-0019,porthos bowed with a reverence which anne of austria would have approved of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7443,8063-274116-0020,and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in question not however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7444,8063-274116-0021,frankly conceded d'artagnan complimented planchet and said you are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable life monsieur said planchet laughing is capital which a man ought to invest as sensibly as he possibly can,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7445,8063-274116-0022,planchet turned to his housekeeper you have before you he said to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7446,8063-274116-0023,and about two others as well said the lady with a very decided flemish accent madame is dutch inquired d'artagnan porthos curled his mustache a circumstance which was not lost upon d'artagnan who noticed everything i am from antwerp said the lady,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7447,8063-274116-0024,you should not call her madame said d'artagnan why not asked planchet because it would make her seem older every time you call her so well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7448,8063-274116-0025,and a very pretty name too said porthos,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7449,8063-274116-0026,she ran away from a brute of a husband who was in the habit of beating her being myself a picard born i was always very fond of the artesian women and it is only a step from artois to flanders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7450,8063-274116-0027,she placed her two thousand florins in my establishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7453,8063-274116-0030,the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of dust which covered them porthos's heart began to expand as he said i am hungry and he sat himself beside madame truchen whom he looked at in the most killing manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7454,8063-274116-0031,do not trouble yourselves he said if truchen should leave the table now and then during supper for she will have to look after your bedrooms in fact the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently and they could hear on the first floor above them the creaking of the wooden bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7455,8063-274116-0032,d'artagnan still preserved his dignity and self possession but porthos had lost a portion of his and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7456,8063-274116-0033,recommended a new descent into the cellar and as planchet no longer walked with the steadiness of a well trained foot soldier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7457,8063-274116-0034,they set off humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7458,8063-274116-0035,while the two wine bibbers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7459,8063-274116-0036,porthos fancies himself at la rochelle thought d'artagnan as they returned freighted with bottles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7460,8063-274116-0037,d'artagnan whom nothing ever escaped remarked how much redder truchen's left cheek was than her right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7461,8063-274116-0038,and truchen was looking at him with a most bewitching smile the sparkling wine of anjou very soon produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7463,8063-274116-0040,no one in the house was capable of taking the slightest notice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7464,8063-274115-0000,would be one of the privileged travelers and as the plume in porthos's hat made the wooden candles suspended over the front jingle together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7465,8063-274115-0001,for the morrow but the grocer had a heart of gold ever mindful of the good old times a trait that carries youth into old age so planchet notwithstanding a sort of internal shiver checked as soon as experienced,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7466,8063-274115-0002,received porthos with respect mingled with the tenderest cordiality porthos who was a little cold and stiff in his manners at first on account of the social difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer soon began to soften when he perceived so much good feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7467,8063-274115-0003,and into the drawers full of sweetmeats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7468,8063-274115-0004,where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose detected the delicious figs from provence filberts from the forest tours plums were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours his teeth like millstones cracked heaps of nuts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7469,8063-274115-0005,the shells of which were scattered all over the floor where they were trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop porthos pulled from the stalk with his lips at one mouthful bunches of the rich muscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7470,8063-274115-0006,at each other without venturing to open their lips they did not know who porthos was for they had never seen him before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7471,8063-274115-0007,had already begun to disappear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7472,8063-274115-0008,he will very soon have none at all to do if this sort of thing continues grumbled the foreman who had planchet's word that he should be his successor in the midst of his despair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7473,8063-274115-0009,he approached porthos who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop itself he hoped that porthos would rise and that this movement would distract his devouring ideas what do you want my man asked porthos affably,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7474,8063-274115-0010,i should like to pass you monsieur if it is not troubling you too much very well said porthos it does not trouble me in the least at the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband lifted him off the ground and placed him very gently on the other side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7475,8063-274115-0011,smiling all the while with the same affable expression as soon as porthos had placed him on the ground the lad's legs so shook under him that he fell back upon some sacks of corks but noticing the giant's gentleness of manner he ventured again and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7476,8063-274115-0012,yes but if raisins nuts and almonds are heating there is no doubt at all of it monsieur honey is very cooling said porthos stretching out his hand toward a small barrel of honey which was open and he plunged the scoop with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7477,8063-274115-0013,the foreman clasped his hands together the two others got under the counters fearing porthos might have a taste for human flesh we shall only take a sort of snack here said d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7478,8063-274115-0014,so much the better you overwhelm me monsieur le baron the monsieur le baron had a great effect upon the men who detected a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind this title too reassured them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7479,8063-274115-0015,they had never heard that an ogre was ever called monsieur le baron i will take a few biscuits to eat on the road said porthos carelessly and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge pocket of his doublet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7480,8063-274115-0016,my shop is saved exclaimed planchet yes as the cheese was whispered the foreman what cheese the dutch cheese inside which a rat had made his way and we found only the rind left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7481,8063-274115-0017,where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared alas thought the grocer addressing a look at d'artagnan full of entreaty which the latter half understood as soon as they had finished eating they set off it was late,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7482,8063-274115-0018,when the three riders who had left paris about six in the evening arrived at fontainebleau,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7483,8063-274115-0019,and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows his woods and his rabbit warrens porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor when d'artagnan saw his two companions in earnest conversation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7484,8063-274115-0020,separated himself from the whole world as he had done from porthos and from planchet the moon shone softly through the foliage of the forest the breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfumed to the horse's nostrils and they snorted and pranced along delightedly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7485,8063-274115-0021,in the beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees and where he had played under the green apple trees covered with red cheeked fruit he went on to say that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune he would return to nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7486,8063-274115-0022,how so why you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7487,8063-274115-0023,what is it inquired porthos looking all round him as if in search of the circumstance that annoyed planchet and desirous of freeing him from it why formerly said the grocer you used to call me planchet quite short,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7488,8063-274115-0024,and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner than you do now certainly certainly i should have said so formerly replied the good natured porthos with an embarrassment full of delicacy but formerly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7489,8063-274115-0025,so that monsieur le baron continued the grocer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7490,8063-274115-0026,if that be the case my dear planchet i will do so certainly replied porthos and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7491,8063-274115-0027,but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7492,8063-274115-0028,which made the animal's legs almost give way d'artagnan burst out laughing as he said take care planchet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7493,8063-274115-0029,oh said planchet mousqueton is not dead and yet monsieur le baron is very fond of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7494,8063-274115-0030,and i was only saying this very morning to d'artagnan how much i regretted him but tell me planchet thank you monsieur le baron thank you good lad good lad how many acres of park have you got of park,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7495,8063-274115-0031,whereabouts monsieur at your chateau oh monsieur le baron i have neither chateau nor park nor meadows nor woods what have you got then inquired porthos and why do you call it a country seat i did not call it a country seat monsieur le baron,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7496,8063-274115-0032,replied planchet somewhat humiliated but a country box ah ah i understand you are modest no monsieur le baron i speak the plain truth i have rooms for a couple of friends that's all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7497,8063-274115-0033,in the first place they can walk about the king's forest which is very beautiful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7498,8063-274115-0034,nearly as beautiful as my forest at berry planchet opened his eyes very wide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7499,8063-274115-0035,because i don't know where it ends and also because it is full of poachers how can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you because they hunt my game and i hunt them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7500,8063-274115-0036,which in these peaceful times is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7501,8063-274112-0000,and exceedingly unhappy in fact d'artagnan d'artagnan we say for we must call him by his name to remind our readers of his existence d'artagnan we repeat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7502,8063-274112-0001,had absolutely nothing whatever to do amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion after following the king during two whole days at fontainebleau,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7503,8063-274112-0002,the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to satisfy the cravings of his nature at every moment assailed by people asking him how do you think this costume suits me monsieur d'artagnan he would reply to them in quiet sarcastic tones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7504,8063-274112-0003,why i think you are quite as well dressed as the,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7505,8063-274112-0004,it was just such a compliment d'artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay any other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7506,8063-274112-0005,whenever any one asked him how do you intend to dress yourself this evening he replied i shall undress myself at which the ladies all laughed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7507,8063-274112-0006,and also to receive in exchange d'artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of private business at the moment d'artagnan made his request,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7508,8063-274112-0007,quite exhausted from dancing you wish to leave me monsieur d'artagnan inquired the king with an air of astonishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7509,8063-274112-0008,any one who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave him sire said d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7510,8063-274112-0009,ah if i could only hold the balancing pole while you were dancing it would be a very different affair but my dear monsieur d'artagnan said the king gravely people dance without balancing poles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7511,8063-274112-0010,ah indeed said the musketeer continuing his imperceptible tone of irony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7512,8063-274112-0011,therefore at fontainebleau for to do so would be useless but with the permission of our readers follow him to the rue des lombards where he was located at the sign of the pilon d'or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7513,8063-274112-0012,and the weather was exceedingly warm there was only one window open and that one belonging to a room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7514,8063-274112-0013,a perfume of spices mingled with another perfume less exotic but more penetrating namely that which arose from the street ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer d'artagnan reclining in an immense straight backed chair with his legs not stretched out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7515,8063-274112-0014,but simply placed upon a stool formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen both his arms were crossed over his head his head reclining upon his left shoulder like alexander the great his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7516,8063-274112-0015,usually so quick and intelligent in their expression were now half closed and seemed fastened as it were upon a small corner of blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7517,8063-274112-0016,there was just enough blue and no more to fill one of the sacks of lentils or haricots which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor thus extended at his ease and sheltered in his place of observation behind the window d'artagnan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7518,8063-274112-0017,seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the palace but was on the contrary a quiet easy going citizen in a state of stagnation between his dinner and supper or between his supper and his bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7519,8063-274112-0018,while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch could be heard retreating d'artagnan continued however to think of nothing except the blue corner of the sky a few paces from him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7520,8063-274112-0019,and his eyes fixed on d'artagnan who was either thinking dreaming or sleeping with his eyes open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7521,8063-274112-0020,but d'artagnan did not stir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7522,8063-274112-0021,after a prolonged reflection on the subject the most ingenious means that suggested itself to him under the present circumstances was to let himself roll off the sack on to the floor murmuring at the same time against himself the word stupid but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7523,8063-274112-0022,notwithstanding the noise produced by planchet's fall d'artagnan who had in the course of his existence heard many other and very different falls did not appear to pay the least attention to the present one besides,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7524,8063-274112-0023,and yet planchet fancied that in token of tacit approval he saw him imperceptibly smile at the word stupid this emboldened him to say are you asleep monsieur d'artagnan no planchet i am not even asleep replied the musketeer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7525,8063-274112-0024,i am in despair said planchet to hear such a word as even well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7526,8063-274112-0025,of course monsieur d'artagnan well well then the word distresses me beyond measure tell me why you are distressed planchet said d'artagnan if you say that you are not even asleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7527,8063-274112-0026,planchet you know that i am never bored except to day and the day before yesterday bah monsieur d'artagnan it is a week since you returned here from fontainebleau,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7528,8063-274112-0027,in other words you have no longer your orders to issue or your men to review and maneuver you need the sound of guns drums and all that din and confusion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7529,8063-274112-0028,when you were there when we both were there a certain arab,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7530,8063-274112-0029,he was a clever fellow although of a very odd complexion which was the same color as your olives well this arab whenever he had done eating or working used to sit down to rest himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7531,8063-274112-0030,as i am resting myself now and smoked i cannot tell you what sort of magical leaves in a large amber mouthed tube,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7532,8063-274112-0031,better to sit down than to stand up to lie down than to sit down to be dead than to lie down he was an acutely melancholy arab and i remember him perfectly well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7533,8063-274112-0032,he used to cut off the heads of protestants with the most singular gusto precisely and then used to embalm them when they were worth the trouble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7534,8063-274112-0033,he looked like a basket maker making baskets you are quite right planchet he did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7535,8063-274112-0034,i have no doubt of it but what do you think of his mode of reasoning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7536,8063-274112-0035,in point of fact then better to sit down than to stand up is plain enough especially when one may be fatigued and planchet smiled in a roguish way as for better to be lying down let that pass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7537,8063-274112-0036,it is in my opinion very absurd my own undoubted preference being for my bed and if you are not of my opinion it is simply as i have already had the honor of telling you because you are boring yourself to death planchet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7538,8063-274112-0037,exactly well then i am like his hare he has got a hare also then he has all sorts of animals well what does his hare do then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7539,8063-274112-0038,thinks ah,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7540,8063-274112-0039,and yet monsieur you have a look out upon the street yes and wonderfully interesting that is of course but it is no less true monsieur that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7541,8063-274112-0040,ah planchet my friend returned d'artagnan you are getting ambitious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7542,5808-54425-0000,five years is but a short time in the life of a man and yet many things may happen therein for instance the whole way of a family's life may be changed good natures may be made into bad ones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7543,5808-54425-0001,and out of a soul of faith grow a spirit of unbelief the independence of respectability may harden into the insolence of defiance and the sensitive cheek of modesty into the brazen face of shamelessness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7544,5808-54425-0002,it may be true that the habits of years are hard to change but this is not true of the first sixteen or seventeen years of a young person's life else kitty hamilton and joe could not so easily have become what they were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7545,5808-54425-0003,it had taken barely five years to accomplish an entire metamorphosis of their characters in joe's case even a shorter time was needed he was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him and once started,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7546,5808-54425-0004,there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths for his will was as flabby as his conscience and his pride which stands to some men for conscience had no definite aim or direction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7547,5808-54425-0005,hattie sterling had given him both his greatest impulse for evil and for good she had at first given him his gentle push but when she saw that his collapse would lose her a faithful and useful slave,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7548,5808-54425-0006,she had sought to check his course her threat of the severance of their relations had held him up for a little time and she began to believe that he was safe again he went back to the work he had neglected drank moderately,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7549,5808-54425-0007,and acted in most things as a sound sensible being then all of a sudden he went down again and went down badly she kept her promise and threw him over,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7550,5808-54425-0008,then he became a hanger on at the clubs a genteel loafer he used to say in his sober moments that at last he was one of the boys that sadness had spoken of he did not work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7551,5808-54425-0009,but he soon tired of being separated from hattie and straightened up again after some demur she received him upon his former footing it was only for a few months he fell again for almost four years this had happened intermittently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7552,5808-54425-0010,finally he took a turn for the better that endured so long that hattie sterling again gave him her faith then the woman made her mistake she warmed to him she showed him that she was proud of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7553,5808-54425-0011,he went forth at once to celebrate his victory he did not return to her for three days then he was battered unkempt and thick of speech she looked at him in silent contempt for a while as he sat nursing his aching head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7554,5808-54425-0012,she said finally with cutting scorn you ought to be put under a glass case and placed on exhibition he groaned and his head sunk lower a drunken man is always disarmed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7555,5808-54425-0013,his helplessness instead of inspiring her with pity inflamed her with an unfeeling anger that burst forth in a volume of taunts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7556,5808-54425-0014,no one had ever looked at you until i picked you up and you ve been strutting around ever since,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7557,5808-54425-0015,and now this is the way you pay me back drunk half the time and half drunk the rest well you know what i told you the last time you got loaded i mean it too you re not the only star in sight see she laughed meanly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7558,5808-54425-0016,and began to sing you ll have to find another baby now for the first time he looked up and his eyes were full of tears tears both of grief and intoxication there was an expression of a whipped dog on his face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7559,5808-54425-0017,he pleaded stretching out his hands to her her eyes blazed back at him but she sang on insolently tauntingly the very inanity of the man disgusted her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7560,5808-54425-0018,and on a sudden impulse she sprang up and struck him full in the face with the flat of her hand he was too weak to resist the blow and tumbling from the chair fell limply to the floor where he lay at her feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7561,5808-54425-0019,alternately weeping aloud and quivering with drunken hiccoughing sobs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7562,5808-54425-0020,you sha'n't lay around my house he had already begun to fall into a drunken sleep but she shook him got him to his feet and pushed him outside the door now go you drunken dog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7563,5808-54425-0021,and never put your foot inside this house again he stood outside swaying dizzily upon his feet and looking back with dazed eyes at the door then he muttered pu me out wi you pu me out damn you well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7564,5808-54425-0022,and he half walked half fell down the street sadness and skaggsy were together at the club that night five years had not changed the latter as to wealth or position or inclination,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7565,5808-54425-0023,and he was still a frequent visitor at the banner he always came in alone now for maudie had gone the way of all the half world and reached depths to which mister skaggs's job prevented him from following her however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7566,5808-54425-0024,he mourned truly for his lost companion and to night he was in a particularly pensive mood some one was playing rag time on the piano and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7567,5808-54425-0025,skaggsy looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor it made him think of maudie he sighed and turned away i tell you sadness he said impulsively dancing is the poetry of motion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7568,5808-54425-0026,yes replied sadness and dancing in rag time is the dialect poetry the reporter did not like this it savoured of flippancy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7569,5808-54425-0027,and he was about entering upon a discussion to prove that sadness had no soul when joe with blood shot eyes and dishevelled clothes staggered in and reeled towards them drunk again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7570,5808-54425-0028,said sadness really it s a waste of time for joe to sober up hullo there as the young man brought up against him take a seat he put him in a chair at the table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7571,5808-54425-0029,oh a hair of the dog some men shave their dogs clean and then have hydrophobia here jack they drank and then as if the whiskey had done him good joe sat up in his chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7572,5808-54425-0030,lucky dog you might have known it would have happened sooner or later better sooner than never skaggs smoked in silence and looked at joe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7573,5808-54425-0031,then bracing himself up again he broke out suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7574,5808-54425-0032,he never stole that money know he di n he threatened to fall asleep now but the reporter was all alert he scented a story by jove he exclaimed did you hear that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7577,5808-54425-0035,yes he does a drunken man tells the truth in some cases said sadness oh let me alone man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7578,5808-54425-0036,and if this story is one i m a made man the drink seemed to revive the young man again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7579,5808-54425-0037,at its close he relapsed into stupidity murmuring she throwed me down well sneered sadness you see drunken men tell the truth and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7581,5808-54425-0039,oh you have well don't handle it carelessly it might go off and sadness rose the reporter sat thinking for a time and then followed him leaving joe in a drunken sleep at the table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7582,5808-54425-0040,there he lay for more than two hours when he finally awoke he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep a part of the helplessness of his intoxication had gone but his first act was to call for more whiskey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7583,5808-54425-0041,this he gulped down and followed with another and another for a while he stood still brooding silently his red eyes blinking at the light then he turned abruptly and left the club,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7584,5808-54425-0042,it was very late when he reached hattie's door but he opened it with his latch key as he had been used to do he stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy as he had so often done before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7585,5808-54425-0043,then he went directly to her room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7586,5808-54425-0044,his voice was steadier now but grim what do you want,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7587,5808-54425-0045,get out or i ll have you taken out she sprang up in bed glaring angrily at him his hands twitched nervously as if her will were conquering him and he were uneasy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7589,5808-54425-0047,she started to rise but he took a step towards her and she paused he looked as she had never seen him look before his face was ashen and his eyes like fire and blood she quailed beneath the look,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7590,5808-54425-0048,he took another step towards her you put me out to night he repeated like a dog his step was steady and his tone was clear menacingly clear she shrank back from him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7591,5808-54425-0049,back to the wall still his hands twitched,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7592,5808-54425-0050,still he crept slowly towards her his lips working and his hands moving convulsively joe joe she said hoarsely what s the matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7593,5808-54425-0051,the gown had fallen away from her breast and showed the convulsive fluttering of her heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7594,5808-54425-0052,and his hands sought each other while the fingers twitched over one another like coiling serpents you put me out you you and you made me what i am,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7595,5808-54425-0053,the realisation of what he was of his foulness and degradation seemed just to have come to him fully you made me what i am and then you sent me away you let me come back and now you put me out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7596,5808-54425-0054,she gazed at him fascinated she tried to scream and she could not this was not joe this was not the boy that she had turned and twisted about her little finger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7597,5808-54425-0055,this was a terrible terrible man or a monster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7598,5808-54425-0056,for an instant she lost their steady glare and then she found her voice the scream was checked as it began his fingers had closed over her throat just where the gown had left it temptingly bare they gave it the caress of death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7599,5808-54425-0057,she struggled they held her her eyes prayed to his but his were the fire of hell she fell back upon her pillow in silence he had not uttered a word he held her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7600,5808-54425-0058,finally he flung her from him like a rag and sank into a chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7601,5808-48608-0000,when it was the three hundred and forty seventh night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that ibrahim son of al mahdi continued now when the housemaster heard my name he sprang to his feet and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7602,5808-48608-0001,indeed i wondered that such gifts should belong to any but the like of thee and fortune hath done me a good turn for which i cannot thank her too much but haply this is a dream for how could i hope that one of the caliphate house should visit my humble home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7603,5808-48608-0002,and carouse with me this night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7604,5808-48608-0003,as to the cause of my visit in the most courteous terms so i told him the whole affair first and last hiding naught and said to him now as to the food i have had my will but of the hand and wrist i have still to win my wish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7605,5808-48608-0004,quoth he thou shalt have thy desire of the hand and wrist also inshallah then said he to the slave girl ho such an one bid such an one come down and he called his slave girls down one by one and showed them to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7606,5808-48608-0005,but i saw not my mistress among them and he said o my lord there is none left save my mother and sister but by allah i must needs have them also down and show them to thee so i marvelled at his courtesy and large heartedness and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7607,5808-48608-0006,may i be thy sacrifice begin with the sister and he answered with joy and goodwill so she came down and he showed me her hand and behold she was the owner of the hand and wrist quoth i,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7608,5808-48608-0007,seeketh in marriage my sister such an one and i call you to witness that i give her in wedlock to him and that he hath settled upon her ten thousand dinars and he said to me i give thee my sister in marriage at the portion aforesaid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7609,5808-48608-0008,i consent answered i and am herewith content whereupon he gave one of the bags to her and the other to the witnesses and said to me o our lord i desire to adorn a chamber for thee where thou mayst sleep with thy wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7610,5808-48608-0009,but i was abashed at his generosity and was ashamed to lie with her in his house so i said equip her and send her to my place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7611,5808-48608-0010,and by thy being o commander of the faithful he sent me with her such an equipage that my house for all its greatness was too strait to hold it and i begot on her this boy that standeth in thy presence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7612,5808-48608-0011,then al maamun marvelled at the man's generosity and said gifted of allah is he never heard i of his like and he bade ibrahim bin al mahdi bring him to court that he might see him he brought him and the caliph conversed with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7613,5808-48608-0012,and his wit and good breeding so pleased him that he made him one of his chief officers and allah is the giver the bestower men also relate the tale of the woman whose hands were cut off for giving alms to the poor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7614,5808-48608-0013,a certain king once made proclamation to the people of his realm saying if any of you give alms of aught i will verily and assuredly cut off his hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7615,5808-48608-0014,wherefore all the people abstained from alms deed and none could give anything to any one now it chanced that one day a beggar accosted a certain woman and indeed hunger was sore upon him and said to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7616,5808-48608-0015,give me an alms and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was three hundred and forty eighth night she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7617,5808-48608-0016,it hath reached me o auspicious king that quoth the beggar to the woman give me an alms however small but she answered him how can i give thee aught when the king cutteth off the hands of all who give alms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7618,5808-48608-0017,then he said i conjure thee by allah almighty give me an alms so when he adjured her by the holy name of allah she had ruth on him and gave him two scones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7619,5808-48608-0018,the king heard of this whereupon he called her before him and cut off her hands after which she returned to her house now it chanced after a while that the king said to his mother i have a mind to take a wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7620,5808-48608-0019,so do thou marry me to a fair woman quoth she there is among our female slaves one who is unsurpassed in beauty but she hath a grievous blemish the king asked what is that and his mother answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7621,5808-48608-0020,she hath had both her hands cut off said he let me see her so she brought her to him and he was ravished by her and married her and went in unto her and begat upon her a son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7622,5808-48608-0021,now this was the woman who had given two scones as an alms to the asker and whose hands had been cut off therefor and when the king married her her fellow wives envied her and wrote to the common husband that she was an unchaste,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7623,5808-48608-0022,having just given birth to the boy so he wrote to his mother bidding her carry the woman into the desert and leave her there the old queen obeyed his commandment and abandoned the woman and her son in the desert,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7624,5808-48608-0023,whereupon she fell to weeping for that which had befallen her and wailing with exceeding sore wail as she went along she came to a river and knelt down to drink being overcome with excess of thirst,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7625,5808-48608-0024,for fatigue of walking and for grief but as she bent her head the child which was at her neck fell into the water then she sat weeping bitter tears for her child and as she wept behold came up two men who said to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7626,5808-48608-0025,what maketh thee weep quoth she i had a child at my neck and he hath fallen into the water they asked wilt thou that we bring him out to thee and she answered yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7627,5808-48608-0026,so they prayed to almighty allah and the child came forth of the water to her safe and sound,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7628,5808-48608-0027,yes replied she whereupon they prayed to allah extolled and exalted be he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7629,5808-48608-0028,and with the profit he laid in daily bread for his household one morning he went out and sold the day's yarn as wont when there met him one of his brethren who complained to him of need so he gave him the price of the thread and returned empty handed to his family,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7630,5808-48608-0029,who said to him where is the cotton and the food quoth he such an one met me and complained to me of want whereupon i gave him the price of the yarn and they said how shall we do we have nothing to sell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7631,5808-48608-0030,so he took them to the bazar but none would buy them of him however presently as he stood in the market there passed by a man with a fish and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7632,5808-48608-0031,and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the three hundred and forty ninth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7633,5808-48608-0032,that the man took the trencher and jar to the bazar but none would buy them of him however there presently passed by a man with a fish which was so stinking and so swollen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7634,5808-48608-0033,and he said to the jew wilt thou sell me thine unsaleable ware for mine yes answered the jew and giving him the wooden trencher and jar took the fish and carried it home to his family who said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7635,5808-48608-0034,what shall we do with this fish quoth he we will broil it and eat it till it please allah to provide bread for us so they took it and ripping open its belly found therein a great pearl and told the head of the household who said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7636,5808-48608-0035,see ye if it be pierced if so it belongeth to some one of the folk if not tis a provision of allah for us so they examined it and found it unpierced,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7637,5808-48608-0036,now when it was the morrow the jew carried it to one of his brethren which was an expert in jewels and the man asked o such an one whence haddest thou this pearl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7638,5808-48608-0037,it was a gift of almighty allah to us and the other said it is worth a thousand dirhams and i will give thee that but take it to such an one for he hath more money and skill than i so the jew took it to the jeweller who said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7639,5808-48608-0038,it is worth seventy thousand dirhams and no more then he paid him that sum and the jew hired two porters to carry the money to his house as he came to his door a beggar accosted him saying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7640,5808-48608-0039,quoth the jew to the asker but yesterday we were even as thou take thee half this money so he made two parts of it and each took his half,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7641,5808-48608-0040,the baker and other tradesmen dunned and importuned me and my misery became extreme for i knew of no resource nor what to do things being on this wise there came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7642,5808-48608-0041,at the door is a pilgrim wight who seeketh admission to thee quoth i admit him so he came in and behold he was a khorasani we exchanged salutations and he said to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7643,5808-48608-0042,tell me art thou abu hassan al ziyadi and i replied yes what is thy wish quoth he i am a stranger and am minded to make the pilgrimage but i have with me a great sum of money which is burdensome to bear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7644,5808-48608-0043,so i wish to deposit these ten thousand dirhams with thee whilst i make my pilgrimage and return if the caravan march back and thou see me not then know that i am dead in which case the money is a gift from me to thee but if i come back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7645,5808-48608-0044,it shall be mine i answered be it as thou wilt an thus please allah almighty so he brought out a leather bag and i said to the servant fetch the scales,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7646,5808-48608-0045,and when he brought them the man weighed out the money and handed it to me after which he went his way then i called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7647,5808-48608-0046,and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the three hundred and fiftieth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7648,5808-48608-0047,that quoth abu hassan al ziyadi i called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities and spent freely and amply saying to myself by the time he returns allah will have relieved me with one or other of the bounties he hath by him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7649,5808-48608-0048,however on the very next day the servant came in to me and said thy friend the khorasan man is at the door admit him answered i so he came in and said to me i had purposed to make the pilgrimage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7650,5808-48608-0049,and i have resolved to return so give me the monies i deposited with thee yesterday when i heard this i was troubled and perplexed beyond measure of perplexity known to man and wotted not what reply to make him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7651,5808-48608-0050,for if i denied it he would put me on my oath and i should be disgraced in the world to come whilst if i told him that i had spent the money he would make an outcry and dishonour me before men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7652,5808-48608-0051,so i said to him allah give thee health,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7653,5808-48608-0052,so i rose and bade the boy saddle me the she mule answered he o my lord it is yet but the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to rest i returned to my bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7654,5808-48608-0053,but sleep was forbidden to me and i ceased not to awaken the boy and he to put me off till break of day when he saddled me the mule and i mounted and rode out not knowing whither to go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7655,5808-48608-0054,whilst she fared on with me to the eastward of baghdad presently as i went along behold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7656,5808-48608-0055,expound to me thy case so i recounted to him my case and he wept sore and said to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7657,5808-48608-0056,woe to thee succour abu hassan al ziyadi i awoke a second time but knowing thee not i went to sleep again and he came to me a third time and still i knew thee not and went to sleep again then he came to me once more and said out on thee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7658,5808-48608-0057,succour abu hassan al ziyadi after that i dared not sleep any more but watched the rest of the night and aroused my people and sent them on all sides in quest of thee then he gave me one myriad of dirhams saying this is for the khorasani,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7659,5808-48608-0058,and other ten thousand saying spend freely of this and amend thy case therewith and set thine affairs in order,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7660,5808-48608-0059,and behold presently came the khorasani so i carried him into the house and brought out to him one myriad of dirhams saying here is thy money quoth he it is not my very money how cometh this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7661,5808-48608-0060,so i told him the whole story and he wept and said by allah haddest thou told me the fact at first i had not pressed thee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7662,1116-137572-0000,the wedding shuts one gate and opens another the longings and dreamings of courtship are at an end the supreme intimacy of life begins as john and mary move away from the altar pronounced man and wife they know they are starting a great adventure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7663,1116-137572-0001,his beaming face masks a stiff determination to keep his bride happy in spite of any worldly obstacles her radiance hides a solemn inward vow to do everything humanly possible to make smooth the way of their life together they are right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7664,1116-137572-0002,unless they are very different from most people this new joint enterprise is going to mean more to each of them than anything else ever can before them is a clear road not to happiness as they may believe but to the opportunity for gaining happiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7665,1116-137572-0003,when one has received the promise of something greatly desired but must wait awhile before its delivery the happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7666,1116-137572-0004,but the first days of marriage bring out a different set of feelings those that come when one has definitely obtained possession of anything that before was only promised at first the emotions seem to stand still this is the long coveted moment then one begins to appraise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7667,1116-137572-0005,is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected because reality rarely measures up to imagination the first answer is almost bound to be no this is not what i expected and the first emotion tends to be disappointment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7668,1116-137572-0006,regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than although different from what the imagination pictured knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage but likely to occur in all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7669,1116-137572-0007,roughly both the helps and the hindrances to married happiness can be lumped under one word personalities temperament mannerisms tastes all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person make up the chief source of the advantages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7670,1116-137572-0008,and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage these traits cannot be changed overnight nor is it necessary or at all wise that they should be john attracts mary and she appeals to him because the personality of each one is what it is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7671,1116-137572-0009,love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction and love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathway to marriage success but love is not a finished product that once it comes can forever after be trusted to keep its strength,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7672,1116-137572-0010,like everything else that is alive it must be kept growing through exercise or it wastes away love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving but it does not give the direction that comes from understanding and cooperation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7673,1116-137572-0011,this is what they must guard against while love is still the moving force of their lives they must study the problems that are due to come to wait until they are beset by them is to beg for trouble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7674,1116-137572-0012,in order to cope with their problems they must realize first that they cannot stumble upon married happiness that they must possess and cultivate a positive will to succeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7675,1116-137572-0013,here are nine guideposts to help john and mary along their road one the first requirement is the building of a union that is just to both the smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7676,1116-137572-0014,inevitable in the coming together of any two persons intensified when those two persons are as different as a man and a woman and unavoidable for two committed to a lifetime together in the close quarters of marriage two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7677,1116-137572-0015,compromise will lift these essentially petty decisions of precedence above the level of selfishness decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both not the selfish or narrow wish of either,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7678,1116-137572-0016,the choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made human judgment being as faulty as it is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7679,1116-137572-0017,in either situation the particular couple involved have to weigh delicately the effect on their joint enterprise of the conflicting courses of action much as mary may crave a child or a car,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7680,1116-137572-0018,if each one is hurt at the other's inability to join instantly in his or her plans they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7681,1116-137572-0019,regardless of its effect on the mate is short sighted in the extreme even if you could care only for personal pleasure that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure staging a contest or a succession of small contests for the sake of finding out who is boss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7682,1116-137572-0020,builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end it is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish what is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being head of the house if your spouse craves that distinction by all means hand it over without delay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7683,1116-137572-0021,it is an empty honor for the one who bends but does not break will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving in to the man this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7684,1116-137572-0022,no man can afford to be crippled for life by letting his wife swaddle him with solicitude as some mothers spoil their children for their own glorification a woman's feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that aside from her momentary pleasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7685,1116-137572-0023,any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it this changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband all this must be taken into account in making decisions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7686,1116-137572-0024,compromise not submission should be the rule if john forges ahead on one count mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front three,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7687,1116-137572-0025,and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a topheavy hypocrisy a superstructure calculated to impress the observer but built on a shaky foundation of chaos,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7688,1116-137572-0026,a chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment but a human being's more lasting change is not so readily made each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7689,1116-137572-0027,therefore you have to respect yourself and act as if you did even at home too many couples exploit the sense of let down that marriage brings with it after so long a time husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7690,1116-137572-0028,knowing themselves accepted they lounge mentally mannerly and physically when at home or elsewhere alone together some of this relaxation is a good thing but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7691,1116-137572-0029,using the mate for relief as in nagging whining crying or grumbling is taboo if you are tired or irritable you can rest or exercise for restoration as in the days before marriage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7692,1116-137572-0030,and dry up the source of refreshment you are trying to tap fatigue and nervousness expressed breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience four too great concentration is to be avoided,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7693,1116-137572-0031,even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life to care only for each other is selfishness for two only one step removed from self centered engrossment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7694,1116-137572-0032,this is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close grown love of husband and wife a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated other responsibilities other interests may serve a similar purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7695,1116-137572-0033,though more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep friends old and new have a function in relieving the overclose concern of one marriage partner with the other if they are to play their full part in preventing overconcentration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7696,1116-137572-0034,common friends are fine but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7697,1116-137572-0035,the factor that underlies all the perplexities and most of the contentment of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy here the supreme testing always comes each means so much to the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7698,1116-137572-0036,the wife may be alone part of the day and profit by it when john comes home at night he has not had that privilege,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7699,1116-137572-0037,or by going out without his wife or by having his friends in when she is not around five the general level of emotion is what counts not the spectacular scaling of peaks staking all on high moments is melodrama with no comic relief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7700,1116-137572-0038,some husbands some wives are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare ups others cannot utter a poetic phrase,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7701,1116-137572-0039,make a romantic gesture or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it this difference is one of make up and training not of marriage capacity the couple who are sure of each other's steady affection regardless of its expression in romantic interludes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7702,1116-137572-0040,another terrible moment that is due to come may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping soon or late you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you it may be a slight uncouthness at table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7703,1116-137572-0041,now it vexes you and your vexation terrifies you does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did you cannot help your change of feeling how then can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7704,1116-137572-0042,you remember other people you once thought you loved and wonder panic stricken how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did this is probably an almost universal experience marking not the beginning of the end of love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7705,1116-137572-0043,maturity brings recognition of human imperfections in the most heroic but also develops the ability to weigh big and little things and to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7706,1116-137572-0044,always it is the unturned page the holds the answer to the question how goes it with this marriage the present is useful only as a foundation stone for the future which is being built up out of many fleeting present moments each quickly lost in the past,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7707,1116-137572-0045,seven there can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7708,1116-137572-0046,and the two persons have to work out a common life that means something to them over and above the pleasure they may take in each other's company as a continuing part of this life adjustment sex adjustment can develop into a permanent factor of married happiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7709,1116-137572-0047,but without the larger adjustment the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form in the sex life in marriage as in other parts of the association each partner wins by considering the other before the self,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7710,1116-137572-0048,but instead a complete trust in each other one who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage cry babying is no more helpful in marriage than in business or social life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7711,1116-137572-0049,in the healthy marriage this sympathetic response will soon give way to anger which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult in the unhealthy marriage sympathy will grow into pity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7712,1116-137572-0050,the marriage partner who is mature will maintain trust in the other's good intentions in the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings a chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness why doesn't his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism so he can correct it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7713,1116-137572-0051,mary may soon lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement or the combination may be reversed frankness must go clothed in tact stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7714,1116-137572-0052,if the expression of anger is to have its proper stimulative effect it has to be administered but rarely and then in small doses more has a paralyzing effect on the recipient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7715,1116-137572-0053,producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation nine willingness to grow is the most necessary factor for success marriage is a life program of going on together that requires maturity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7716,1116-137572-0054,as this is an impossibility they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction that does not mean they are unadapted to each other they are afraid to leave the known pleasures of their first youth for the unguessed satisfactions of maturity so they try to stand still,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7717,1116-137572-0055,hoping to keep their marriage unchanged in its first stage of promise if both husband and wife accept maturing responsibilities as they come their marriage relationship will keep pace with their own development and will therefore become increasingly satisfying to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7718,1116-132851-0000,and shoes with silver buckles the women were all filled with envy but little cared barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7719,1116-132851-0001,and what was worse often made fun of him with the rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7720,1116-132851-0002,one evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink he was tired with a long day's work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals waiting till they had done and thinking all the while of barbaik,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7721,1116-132851-0003,when a voice came out of the gorse close by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7722,1116-132851-0004,it is i the brownie of the lake replied the voice but where are you inquired jegu look close and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog i can take he added proudly any shape i choose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7723,1116-132851-0005,and even which is much harder be invisible if i want to then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear replied jegu certainly if you wish and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf all dressed in green,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7724,1116-132851-0006,at first under different animal shapes since that time partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves we have continued to transform ourselves and it was in this way that i got to know you how exclaimed jegu filled with astonishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7725,1116-132851-0007,but how are you going to do it exclaimed jegu wonderingly that is my affair perhaps i may tell you later meanwhile you just eat and sleep and don't worry yourself about anything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7726,1116-132851-0008,jegu declared that nothing could be easier and then taking off his hat he thanked the dwarf heartily and led his horses back to the farm next morning was a holiday and barbaik was awake earlier than usual,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7727,1116-132851-0009,as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off she went first to the cow house which it was her duty to keep clean but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7728,1116-132851-0010,the racks filled with hay the cows milked and the pails standing neatly in a row,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7729,1116-132851-0011,and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help to be sure jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7730,1116-132851-0012,indeed barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied if the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly i should like my churns to be full,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7731,1116-132851-0013,and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry and she need never give another thought to the matter if she found the rye bread too hard to bake or the oven taking too long to heat she just murmured i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7732,1116-132851-0014,why am i not already back from morlaix with my milk pot empty my butter bowl inside it a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate and the money i have gained in my apron pocket and in the morning when she got up lo and behold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7733,1116-132851-0015,and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron and she believed that all this was owing to jegu and she could no longer do without him even in her thoughts when things had reached this pass the brownie told the young man that he had better ask barbaik to marry him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7734,1116-132851-0016,and this time the girl did not turn rudely away but listened patiently to the end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7735,1116-132851-0017,and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time just like a young lady and as for the rest of the day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7736,1116-132851-0018,she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7737,1116-132851-0019,barbaik was furious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7738,1116-132851-0020,her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure but when she looked at jegu and beheld his red face squinting eyes and untidy hair her anger was doubled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7739,1116-132851-0021,while now i can receive no presents except from my husband i can never dance except with my husband oh you wretched dwarf i will never never forgive you in spite of her fierce words no one knew better than barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7740,1116-132851-0022,and after receiving an invitation to a wedding she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there to her great joy he consented bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7741,1116-132851-0023,she had hardly spoken when the horse appeared and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held at first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7742,1116-132851-0024,but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as they looked at her horse at length she caught some words uttered by one man to another why the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail and turned in her saddle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7743,1116-132851-0025,but it was of no use he declined to move out of a walk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7744,1116-132851-0026,so one day the brownie asked jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn and whether he would allow them to dance there of course jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie and he ordered barbaik to spread her best table cloths in the barn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7745,1116-132851-0027,when all was ready the dwarfs in new green suits came bustling in very happy and merry and took their seats at the table but in a moment they all sprang up with a cry and ran away screaming for barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet and all their poor little toes were burnt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7746,1116-132851-0028,you won't forget that in a hurry she said smiling grimly to herself but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water which they poured on the fire then they joined hands and danced round it singing wicked traitress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7747,1116-132847-0000,and a girl called bellah postik they were cousins and as their mothers were great friends and constantly in and out of each other's houses they had often been laid in the same cradle and had played and fought over their games when they are grown up they will marry said the mothers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7748,1116-132847-0001,and soon they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their lots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7749,1116-132847-0002,i would rent a bit of ground from the master and then we could be married yes answered bellah with a deep sigh but we live in such hard times and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again we shall have long to wait,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7750,1116-132847-0003,that is quite clear replied houarn turning away to his work whenever they met they repeated their grievances and at length houarn's patience was exhausted and one morning he came to bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7751,1116-132847-0004,the girl was very unhappy as she listened to this and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things she implored houarn not to leave her but he would listen to nothing the birds he said continue flying until they reach a field of corn and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7752,1116-132847-0005,like them i shall seek till i get what i want that is money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten and if you love me bellah you won't attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage the girl saw it was useless to say more so she answered sadly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7753,1116-132847-0006,well go then since you must but first i will divide with you all that my parents left me and going to her room she opened a small chest and took from it a bell a knife and a little stick this bell she said can be heard at any distance however far,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7754,1116-132847-0007,but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger the knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go i will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7755,1116-132847-0008,and the bell to tell me of your perils the stick i shall keep for myself so that i can fly to you if ever you have need of me then they cried for a little on each other's necks and houarn started for the mountains but in those days as in these beggars abounded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7756,1116-132847-0009,and through every village he passed they followed houarn in crowds mistaking him for a gentleman because there were no holes in his clothes there is no fortune to be made here he thought to himself it is a place for spending and not earning i see i must go further,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7757,1116-132847-0010,and he walked on to pont aven a pretty little town built on the bank of a river he was sitting on a bench outside an inn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7758,1116-132847-0011,and the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7759,1116-132847-0012,and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner but he only laughed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7760,1116-132847-0013,but the men did not know how this was to be done and shaking their heads over his obstinacy left him to his fate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7761,1116-132847-0014,the island was large and lying almost across it was a lake with a narrow opening to the sea houarn paid the boatman and sent him away and then proceeded to walk round the lake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7762,1116-132847-0015,as soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise he prepared to jump into the lake and swim to shore but the bird had guessed his intentions and plunged beneath the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7763,1116-132847-0016,the pink and white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace while her long black hair was intertwined with strings of coral and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea at the sight of her houarn stopped dazzled by her beauty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7764,1116-132847-0017,my name is houarn he answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7765,1116-132847-0018,and she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7766,1116-132847-0019,came from shipwrecked vessels and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water i do not wonder exclaimed houarn who now felt quite at home do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you the rich are always envied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7767,1116-132847-0020,the young man gazed at her in surprise could any one so rich and so beautiful really wish to be his wife he looked at her again and bellah was forgotten as he answered a man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer i can only accept it with joy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7768,1116-132847-0021,when it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7769,1116-132847-0022,but it did not sound the least like that to houarn there it is again he said after a short pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7770,1116-132847-0023,jump she replied but soon the noise grew louder and like cries what is it asked houarn beginning to feel uncomfortable just the crickets on the hearth said she and broke into a song which drowned the cries from the pot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7771,1116-132847-0024,but though houarn held his peace he was not as happy as before something seemed to have gone wrong and then he suddenly remembered bellah is it possible i can have forgotten her so soon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7772,1116-132847-0025,and four men stood before him houarn save us we entreat you and save yourself too murmured they not daring to raise their voices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7773,1116-132847-0026,and no sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes as she had done to all our forerunners who are in the fish pond still where you will shortly join them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7774,1116-132847-0027,it was at this very moment that bellah who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy heard the fairy bell tinkle violently at the sound she grew pale for she knew it meant that houarn was in danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7775,1116-132847-0028,little staff of apple tree over the earth and over the sea up in the air be guide to me everywhere to wander free and immediately the stick became a smart little horse with a rosette at each ear and a feather on his forehead he stood quite still,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7776,1116-132847-0029,the swallow is less swift than the wind the wind is less swift than the lightning but you my horse if you love me must be swifter than them all for there is a part of my heart that suffers the best part of my heart that is in danger and the horse heard her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7777,1116-132847-0030,and galloped like a straw carried along by a tempest till they reached the foot of a rock called the leap of the deer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7778,1116-132847-0031,to save you repeated bellah but who are you my little friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7779,1116-132847-0032,and it is owing to her that i am here but what are you doing in this nest i am sitting on six eggs of stone and i shall not be set free till they are hatched,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7780,1116-132847-0033,when you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist and shut her up in it for ever but where am i to find a young man's clothes asked she i will show you he replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7781,1116-132847-0034,and the fourth an iron without waiting for orders they sat down in the nest and crossing their legs comfortably began to prepare the suit of clothes for bellah with one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7782,1116-132847-0035,and with it in her hand she stepped into the blue boat which conducted her to the palace of shells the groac'h seemed overjoyed to see her and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7783,1116-132847-0036,very soon she led her visitor into the great hall where wine and fruit were always waiting and on the table lay the magic knife left there by houarn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7784,1116-132847-0037,and to the pond which contained the fish their sides shining with a thousand different colours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7785,1116-132847-0038,and turning rapidly flung it over the witch's head become in body what you are in soul cried she and in an instant the lovely fairy of the sea was a toad horrible to look upon she struggled hard to tear the net asunder but it was no use,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7786,1116-132847-0039,her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her his little paws crossed over his little heart bellah felt as if fingers were tightening round her throat but she managed to cry is this you my houarn is this you it is i croaked the little frog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7787,1116-132847-0040,in a car drawn by six cockchafers which once had been the six stone eggs here i am he exclaimed you have broken the spell that held me and now come and get your reward and dismounting from his chariot he led them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7788,289-121665-0000,and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills and each morning the mother took her crook,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7789,289-121665-0001,and started out with her sheep that they might feed upon the tender juicy grasses with which the hills abounded the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7790,289-121665-0002,upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the ewes and lambs so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient shepherdess so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage little bo peep as she was called,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7791,289-121665-0003,decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself she was a little mite of a child with flowing nut brown locks and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths she wore a light gray frock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7792,289-121665-0004,fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair all the shepherds and shepherdesses upon the hills both young and old soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7793,289-121665-0005,and there were many willing hands to aid her if which was not often she needed their assistance bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7794,289-121665-0006,laying aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her aged mother one day while thus occupied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7795,289-121665-0007,good morning little bo peep and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon a short stick she was bent nearly double by weight of many years her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7796,289-121665-0008,deep wrinkles seamed her face and hands while her nose and chin were so pointed that they nearly met she was not pleasant to look upon but bo peep had learned to be polite to the aged so she answered sweetly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7797,289-121665-0009,good morning mother can i do anything for you no dearie returned the woman in a cracked voice but i will sit by your side and rest for a time the girl made room on the mound beside her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7798,289-121665-0010,and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy fingers sew up the seams of the new frock she was making by and by the woman asked why do you come out here to sew because i am a shepherdess replied the girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7799,289-121665-0011,but where is your crook on the grass beside me and where are your sheep bo peep looked up and could not see them they must have strayed over the top of the hill she said and i will go and seek them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7800,289-121665-0012,do not be in a hurry croaked the old woman they will return presently without your troubling to find them do you think so asked bo peep of course do not the sheep know you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7801,289-121665-0013,oh yes they know me every one and do not you know the sheep i can call every one by name said bo peep confidently for though i am so young a shepherdess i am fond of my sheep and know all about them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7802,289-121665-0014,the old woman chuckled softly as if the answer amused her and replied no one knows all about anything my dear but i know all about my sheep protested little bo peep do you indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7803,289-121665-0015,then you are wiser that most people and if you know all about them you also know they will come home of their own accord and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7804,289-121665-0016,oh said little bo peep in surprise do they wag their tails i never noticed that indeed exclaimed the old woman then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7805,289-121665-0017,perhaps you have never noticed their tails at all no answered bo peep thoughtfully i do n't know that i ever have the woman laughed so hard at this reply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7806,289-121665-0018,that she began to cough and this made the girl remember that her flock had strayed away i really must go and find my sheep she said rising to her feet and then i shall be sure to notice their tails and see if they wag them sit still my child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7807,289-121665-0019,said the old woman i am going over the hill top myself and i will send the sheep back to you so she got upon her feet and began climbing the hill and the girl heard her saying as she walked away little bo peep has lost her sheep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7808,289-121665-0020,and does n't know where to find em but leave em alone and they ll come home all wagging their tails behind em little bo peep sat still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hill side and disappear over the top by and by she thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7809,289-121665-0021,very soon i shall see the sheep coming back but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance soon the head of the little shepherdess began to nod,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7810,289-121665-0022,little bo peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleating but when she awoke she found it a joke for still they were a fleeting the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7811,289-121665-0023,but as it was now time for luncheon she opened her little basket and ate of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring near by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7812,289-121665-0024,she decided she would not wait any longer so up she took her little crook determined for to find them and began climbing the hill when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7813,289-121665-0025,only a green valley and another hill beyond now really alarmed for the safety of her charge bo peep hurried into the valley and up the farther hill side panting and tired she reached the summit and pausing breathlessly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7814,289-121665-0026,gazed below her quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her truant flock looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle shepherdess bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7815,289-121665-0027,but when she came near she stopped in amazement and held up her little hands with a pretty expression of dismay she had found them indeed but it made her heart bleed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7816,289-121665-0028,nothing was left to each sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be and little bo peep was so heart broken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7817,289-121665-0029,but after awhile the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lambkins so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7818,289-121665-0030,so you have found your sheep dearie she said in her cracked voice yes replied little bo peep with difficulty repressing a sob but look mother they ve all left their tails behind them why so they have exclaimed the old woman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7819,289-121665-0031,and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her what do you suppose has become of their tails asked the girl oh some one has probably cut them off they make nice tippets in winter time you know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7820,289-121665-0032,and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep and so driving them before her she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost tails,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7821,289-121665-0033,but soon the sun began to sink over the hill tops and she knew she must take her sheep home before night overtook them she did not tell her mother of her misfortune for she feared the old shepherdess would scold her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7822,289-121665-0034,and bo peep had fully decided to seek for the tails and find them before she related the story of their loss to anyone each day for many days after that little bo peep wandered about the hills seeking the tails of her sheep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7823,289-121665-0035,and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious but there is an end to all troubles no matter how severe they may seem to be and it happened one day as bo peep did stray unto a meadow hard by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7824,289-121665-0036,the little shepherdess was overjoyed at this discovery and reaching up her crook she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock but how to fasten them onto her sheep again was the question,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7825,289-121665-0037,and after pondering the matter for a time she became discouraged and thinking she was no better off than before the tails were found she began to weep and to bewail her misfortune but amidst her tears she bethought herself of her needle and thread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7826,289-121665-0038,why she exclaimed smiling again i can sew them on of course then she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran o'er hill and dale oh and tried what she could as a shepherdess should to tack to each sheep its tail oh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7827,289-121665-0039,but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail and ran away from her and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7828,289-121665-0040,came hobbling to her side and asked what are you doing with my cat tails your cat tails replied bo peep in surprise what do you mean why these tails are all cut from white pussycats and i put them on the tree to dry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7832,289-121665-0044,and if you had been observing you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7842,289-121652-0007,are doubtless offshoots from ancient folk lore songs and have descended to us through many centuries the connection of mother goose with the rhymes which bear her name is difficult to determine and in fact three countries claim her for their own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7848,289-121652-0013,america bases her claim to mother goose upon the following statement made by the late john fleet eliot a descendant of thomas fleet the printer at the beginning of the eighteenth century there lived in boston a lady named eliza goose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7850,289-121652-0015,and in due time gave birth to a son like most mothers in law in our day the importance of missus goose increased with the appearance of her grandchild and poor mister fleet half distracted with her endless nursery ditties finding all other means fail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7851,289-121652-0016,tried what ridicule could effect and actually printed a book under the title songs of the nursery or mother goose's melodies for children on the title page was the picture of a goose with a very long neck and a mouth wide open and below this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7852,289-121652-0017,printed by t fleet at his printing house in pudding lane seventeen nineteen price two coppers mister wm a wheeler the editor of hurd and houghton's elaborate edition of mother goose eighteen seventy reiterated this assertion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7853,289-121652-0018,and a writer in the boston transcript of june seventeenth eighteen sixty four says fleet's book was partly a reprint of an english collection of songs barclay's and the new title was doubtless a compliment by the printer to his mother in law goose for her contributions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7854,289-121652-0019,she was the mother of sixteen children and a typical old woman who lived in a shoe we may take it to be true that fleet's wife was of the vergoose family and that the name was often contracted to goose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7855,289-121652-0020,but the rest of the story is unsupported by any evidence whatever in fact all that mister eliot knew of it was the statement of the late edward a crowninshield of boston that he had seen fleet's edition in the library of the american antiquarian society,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7856,289-121652-0021,repeated researches at worcester having failed to bring to light this supposed copy and no record of it appearing on any catalogue there we may dismiss the entire story with the supposition that mister eliot misunderstood the remarks made to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7857,289-121652-0022,indeed as mister william h whitmore points out in his clever monograph upon mother goose albany eighteen eighty nine it is very doubtful whether in seventeen nineteen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7858,289-121652-0023,boston children at that date says mister whitmore were fed upon gospel food and it seems extremely improbable that an edition could have been sold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7859,289-121652-0024,is of about the same date as boston's there lived in a town in sussex about the year seventeen o four an old woman named martha gooch she was a capital nurse and in great demand to care for newly born babies therefore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7860,289-121652-0025,through long years of service as nurse she came to be called mother gooch this good woman had one peculiarity she was accustomed to croon queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges and these rhymes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7861,289-121652-0026,seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them that they began to call her mother goose in derision the term being derived from queen goosefoot the mother of charlemagne the old nurse paid no attention to her critics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7862,289-121652-0027,but continued to sing her rhymes as before for however much grown people might laugh at her the children seemed to enjoy them very much and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7863,289-121652-0028,at one time mistress gooch was nursing a child of mister ronald barclay a physician residing in the town and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them in time he wrote them all down and made a book of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7864,289-121652-0029,which it is said was printed by john worthington and son in the strand london in seventeen twelve under the name of ye melodious rhymes of mother goose but even this story of martha gooch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7865,289-121652-0030,is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence the earliest english edition of mother goose's melodies that is absolutely authentic was issued by john newbury of london about the year seventeen sixty and the first authentic american edition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7866,289-121652-0031,in seventeen eighty five none of the earlier editions however contained all the rhymes so well known at the present day since every decade has added its quota to the mass of jingles attributed to mother goose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7867,289-121652-0032,some of the earlier verses have become entirely obsolete and it is well they have for many were crude and silly and others were coarse it is simply a result of the greater refinement of modern civilization,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7868,289-121652-0033,that they have been relegated to oblivion while the real gems of the collection will doubtless live and grow in popular favor for many ages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7869,289-121652-0034,it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth or a living eliza goose martha gooch or the mere oye of perrault the songs that cluster around her name are what we love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7870,289-121652-0035,and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does mother goose herself many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves telling their story tersely but completely there are others which are but bare suggestions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7871,289-121652-0036,leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story perhaps therein may lie part of their charm but however that may be i have thought the children might like the stories told at greater length that they may dwell the longer upon their favorite heroes and heroines,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7872,289-121652-0037,for that reason i have written this book in making the stories i have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes and my hope is that the little ones will like them and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7881,696-92939-0007,and at first they were inclined to look upon miss cavell as an untrained outsider but her tact efficiency and skill soon won the hearts of these good women who afforded her every courtesy and entered into cordial cooperation with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7883,696-92939-0009,but her mother was close to her heart and she saw her as often as she could i may be looked on as an old maid she is reported as saying but with my work and my mother i am a very happy one and desire nothing more as long as i have these two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

7886,696-92939-0012,miss cavell desired to continue her hospital work and went to the governor von bissing to get permission to do so he granted it for the quiet english nurse made an impression upon him we are told that the arrogant german formed a high opinion of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7887,696-92939-0013,so much so that he secretly determined to keep her under the strictest supervision from that time on spies dogged her tracks she cared for the wounded german soldiers and nursed a number of german officers as well as the belgians who were in her care,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7888,696-92939-0014,but this made no difference to the authorities they were determined to detect her in some crime and punish her it was not fitting they thought that an enemy should be engaged in works of mercy even though they themselves might benefit thereby,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7889,696-92939-0015,and soon spies began to come to the governor with tales and fabrications of the crimes that she had been committing in their eyes they bore witness that she had given an overcoat to a frenchman who was cold and hungry and the frenchman later escaped over the dutch frontier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7890,696-92939-0016,on the night of august fifth nineteen fifteen we are told miss cavell was tying up the wounds of a wounded german soldier when a group of armed men entered the room and their leader told her roughly that she was under arrest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7891,696-92939-0017,a blow was the only response when she tried to expostulate she was taken to prison and placed in solitary confinement her arrest was shrouded with the most careful secrecy for the germans did not want to have the representatives of neutral governments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7892,696-92939-0018,such as the united states know of the affair or of what they proposed to do but word of her plight did reach england through a traveler and at once the british government requested the american ambassador doctor page,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7893,696-92939-0019,to get what information he could from brand whitlock the american minister in belgium he went at once to the german authorities but they evaded his questions and waited ten days before giving him a reply then the germans sent him a statement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7894,696-92939-0020,and furnishing them with guides to help them to the dutch frontier whence they might escape into holland and return to england this was the german statement if what they said were true there was still no cause for killing the unfortunate woman in their power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7895,696-92939-0021,for she was not accused at any time of having been a spy but they had planned to try her for her life and mister whitlock soon guessed this in spite of the fact that the germans kept their preparations from him so far as possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7896,696-92939-0022,an american lawyer mister de leval was requested by mister whitlock to take miss cavell's case and do whatever was possible in her behalf he was not allowed to see the prisoner and was not even allowed to look at the documents in the case until the trial began,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7897,696-92939-0023,another lawyer who was a belgian suddenly appeared and told the americans that there was not the least cause for them to worry as miss cavell was sure to receive only just treatment he also promised to let them know when the trial was to take place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7898,696-92939-0024,and that he would keep them informed of all the developments in the case all these promises were broken it is true that he sent a note a few days before the trial telling mister whitlock that the case was about to come to court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7899,696-92939-0025,he never informed them that the death sentence had been imposed he never came to see them afterward and when they sought him for an explanation and for assistance he had disappeared miss cavell was kept in solitary confinement for two months,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7900,696-92939-0026,was calm dignified and brave at the trial and faced her accusers heroically she was dressed in her nurse's uniform and wore the badge of the red cross when mister whitlock learned that she had been tried and sentenced to death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7901,696-92939-0027,he did everything possible to secure her pardon or at least a moderation of the punishment he wrote to baron von der lancken pointing out in a clear and decisive manner that miss cavell had served the germans by caring for their wounded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7902,696-92939-0028,and that the death sentence had never before been inflicted for the crime of which she was accused he also wrote a note to the baron which is as follows my dear baron i am too ill to present my request to you in person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7903,696-92939-0029,but i appeal to your generosity of heart to support it and save this unfortunate woman from death have pity on her brand whitlock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7904,696-92939-0030,all through the day the american legation sent message after message to the german authorities asking for information they received none at six twenty in the evening they were told by a subordinate that the sentence had not been given,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7905,696-92939-0031,only to learn later that it had indeed been declared and that miss cavell would face a firing squad at two o'clock the following morning mister whitlock then urged baron von der lancken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7906,696-92939-0032,to mitigate the sentence and at eleven in the evening he was told that von bissing refused to do anything to save miss cavell's life at the same time that the governor denied this appeal edith cavell was allowed to see a british chaplain she told him that she was not in the least afraid of death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7907,696-92939-0033,and willingly gave her life for her country her words resembled those of florence nightingale that have been quoted elsewhere in this book death she said was well known to her and she had seen it so often that it was not strange or fearful to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7908,696-92939-0034,early in the morning with her eyes bandaged miss cavell was led out to face the rifles of the huns she wore an english flag over her bosom only germans were witnesses of the execution but the german chaplain who attended said that she died like a heroine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7909,696-92939-0035,when her death became known the entire civilized world was shocked and horrified in england this murder did more to stimulate recruiting than anything else up to that time all day long lines of men waited to sign the papers of enlistment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7910,696-92939-0036,and in miss cavell's home town every eligible man was sworn into the army a bitter denunciation of the german act was made by sir edward grey the germans themselves had only a poor excuse for what they had done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7911,696-92939-0037,in brief the case against the german authorities is as follows they had not previously inflicted the death penalty for the offense of which miss cavell was accused they had kept her in solitary confinement and prevented her from consulting an advocate up to the time of her trial,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7912,696-92939-0038,she was tried with great haste and with great secrecy and after the trial the sentence was carried out far more speedily than usual moreover they had deceived mister whitlock and the other members of the american legation and had done so deliberately,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7913,696-92939-0039,after the execution they refused to return the body but the name of edith cavell has become one of the world's great names and her fame grows brighter as time passes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7914,696-93314-0000,the two were alone in the grassy courtyard of the ruined castle the rest of the picnic party had wandered away from them or they from it out of the green grown mound of fallen masonry by the corner of the chapel a great may bush grew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7915,696-93314-0001,silvered and pearled on every scented still spray the sky was deep clear strong blue above and against the blue the wallflowers shone bravely from the cracks and crevices of ruined arch and wall and buttress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7916,696-93314-0002,they shine like gold she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7917,696-93314-0003,do you want some he said and on the instant his hand had found a strong jutting stone his foot a firm ledge and she saw his figure grey flannel against grey stone go up the wall towards the yellow flowers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7918,696-93314-0004,oh don't she cried i don't really want them please not i wish then she stopped because he was already some twelve feet from the ground and she knew that one should not speak to a man who is climbing ruined walls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7919,696-93314-0005,had loved him these two years had loved him since the day of their first meeting and that was just as long as he had loved her but he had never told his love there is a code of honour right or wrong,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7920,696-93314-0006,and it forbids a man with an income of a hundred and fifty a year to speak of love to a girl who is reckoned an heiress there are plenty who transgress the code but they are in all the other stories,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7921,696-93314-0007,he drove his passion on the curb and mastered it yet the questions does she love me does she know i love her does she wonder why i don't speak and the counter questions will she think i don't care,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7922,696-93314-0008,when we let our emotions play the primitive games with us but always the morning brought strength to keep to his resolution he saw her three times a year when christmas easter and midsummer brought her to stay with an aunt brought him home to his people for holidays,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7923,696-93314-0009,and though he had denied himself the joy of speaking in words he had let his eyes speak more than he knew and now he had reached the wallflowers high up and was plucking them and throwing them down so that they fell in a wavering bright shower round her feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7924,696-93314-0010,there was no sound at all but the grating of his feet as he set them on the stones and the movement now and then of a bird in the ivy then came a rustle a gritty clatter loud falling stones his foot had slipped and he had fallen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7925,696-93314-0011,no he was hanging by his hands above the great refectory arch and his body swung heavily with the impetus of the checked fall he was moving along now slowly hanging by his hands now he grasped an ivy root another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7926,696-93314-0012,and pulled himself up till his knee was on the moulding of the arch she would never have believed anyone who had told her that only two minutes had been lived between the moment of his stumble and the other moment when his foot touched the grass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7927,696-93314-0013,caught him by the arms just above the elbow shook him angrily as one shakes a naughty child looked him once in the eyes and buried her face in his neck sobbing long dry breathless sobs even then he tried to be strong,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7928,696-93314-0014,don't he said tenderly don't worry it's all right i was a fool pull yourself together there's someone coming i don't care she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7929,696-93314-0015,for the touch of his cheek pressed against her hair told her all that she wanted to know let them come i don't care oh how could you be so silly and horrid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7930,696-93314-0016,oh how could you of course a really honourable young man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7931,696-93314-0017,he didn't he accepted it with his arms round her and his lips against the face where the tears now ran warm and salt it was one of the immortal moments the picture was charming too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7932,696-93314-0018,a picture to wring the heart of the onlooker with envy or sympathy according to his nature but there was only one onlooker a man of forty or thereabouts who paused for an instant under the great gate of the castle and took in the full charm and meaning of the scene,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7933,696-93314-0019,he turned away and went back along the green path with hell in his heart the other two were in paradise the onlooker fell like the third in eden the serpent in fact two miles away he stopped and lit a pipe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7934,696-93314-0020,it's got to be borne i suppose he said like all the rest of it she's happy enough i ought to be glad anyway i can't stop it perhaps he swore a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7935,696-93314-0021,if he did the less precise and devotional may pardon him he had loved the girl since her early teens and it was only yesterday's post that had brought him the appointment that one might marry on the appointment had come through her father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7936,696-93314-0022,the lover who came to his love over strewn wallflowers desired always as has been seen to act up to his moral ideas so he took next day a much earlier train than was at all pleasant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7937,696-93314-0023,and called on her father to explain his position and set forth his prospects his coming was heralded by a letter from her one must not quote it it is not proper to read other people's letters especially letters to a trusted father from a child only and adored,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7938,696-93314-0024,its effect may be indicated briefly it showed the father that the girl's happiness had had two long years in which to learn to grow round the thought of the young man whom he now faced for the first time odd,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7939,696-93314-0025,for to the father he seemed just like other young men it seemed to him that there were so many more of the same pattern from whom she might have chosen and many of them well off too however the letter lay in the prosperous pocket book in the breast of the father's frock coat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7940,696-93314-0026,and the lover was received as though that letter were a charm to ensure success a faulty or at least a slow working charm however for the father did not lift a bag of gold from his safe and say take her take this also be happy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7941,696-93314-0027,he only consented to a provisional engagement took an earnest interest in the young man's affairs and offered to make his daughter an annual allowance on her marriage at my death she will have more he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7942,696-93314-0028,the young man made a reverent note of the name and the interview seemed played out it's a complicated nuisance the father mused it isn't even as if i knew anything of the chap i oughtn't to have allowed the child to make these long visits to her aunt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7943,696-93314-0029,but as uncomfortable as toothache all the same he had another caller that afternoon he whom we know as the onlooker came to thank him for the influence that had got him the appointment as doctor to the influential insurance company the father opened his heart to the onlooker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7944,696-93314-0030,but i don't see how to develop the action it really is rather amusing that i i should have to tap his beastly chest and listen to his cursed lungs and ask sympathetic questions about his idiotic infant illnesses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7945,696-93314-0031,one thing he ought to be able to remember those pretty vividly the confounded pup the onlooker had never done anything wronger than you have done my good reader and he never expected to meet a giant temptation any more than you do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7946,696-93314-0032,what did he die of for the answer was heart and in it the devil rose and showed the onlooker the really only true and artistic way to develop the action in this situation so dramatic in its possibilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7947,696-93314-0033,the illuminative flash of temptation was so sudden so brilliant that the doctor onlooker closed his soul's eyes and yielded without even the least pretence of resistance he took his stethoscope from the table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7948,696-93314-0034,he walked with more than his ordinary firmness of gait as a man does who is just drunk enough to know that he must try to look sober he walked down the street certain words ringing in his ears heart affected probably hereditary weakness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7949,696-93314-0035,no office in the world would insure you and so it was all over the dreams the hopes the palpitating faith in a beautiful future his days might be long they might be brief but be his life long or short he must live it alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7950,696-93314-0036,he had a little fight with himself as he went down wimpole street then he hailed a hansom and went and told her father who quite agreed with him that it was all over the father wondered at himself for being more sorry than glad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7951,696-93314-0037,she said why you want me more than ever but i may die at any moment so may i and you may live to be a hundred i'll take my chance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7952,696-93314-0038,oh don't you see too that if there is only a little time we ought to spend it together it's impossible he said it's no good i must set my teeth and bear it and you i hope it won't be as hard for you as it will for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7953,696-93314-0039,but you can't give me up if i won't be given up can you his smile struck her dumb it was more convincing than his words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7954,696-93314-0040,you'll forgive me won't you i didn't know and oh what's the use of talking yet they talked for hours conventionally he should have torn himself away unable to bear the strain of his agony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7955,696-93314-0041,as a matter of fact he sat by her holding her hand it was for the last time the last last time there was really a third at that interview the onlooker had imagination enough to see the scene between the parting lovers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7956,696-93314-0042,they parted and now the onlooker dared not meet her dared not call at the house as he had used to do at last the father pressed him he went he met her and it was as though he had met the ghost of her whom he had loved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7957,696-93314-0043,her eyes had blue marks under them her chin had grown more pointed her nose sharper there was a new line on her forehead and her eyes had changed over the wine he heard from the father that she was pining for the lover who had inherited heart disease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7958,696-93314-0044,i suppose it was you who saw him by the way said he a tall well set up young fellow dark not bad looking i i don't remember lied the onlooker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7959,696-93314-0045,with the eyes of his memory on the white face of the man he had stabbed now the lover and the onlooker had each his own burden to bear and the lover's was the easier he worked still though there was now nothing to work for more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7960,696-93314-0046,he worked as he had never worked in his life because he knew that if he did not take to work he should take to drink or worse devils and he set his teeth and swore that her lover should not be degraded he knew that she loved him and there was a kind of fierce pain pleasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7961,696-93314-0047,like that of scratching a sore in the thought that she was as wretched as he was that divided in all else they were yet united in their suffering he thought it made him more miserable to know of her misery but it didn't he never saw her but he dreamed of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7962,696-93314-0048,and sometimes the dreams got out of hand and carried him a thousand worlds from all that lay between them then he had to wake up and that was bad but the onlooker was no dreamer and he saw her about three times a week,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7963,696-93314-0049,covering a clear cut mask of set endurance and there was no work that could shut out that sight no temptation of the world the flesh or the devil to give him even the relief of a fight he had no temptations he had never had but the one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7964,696-93314-0050,his soul was naked to the bitter wind of the actual and the days went by went by and every day he knew more and more surely that he had lied and thrown away his soul and that the wages of sin were death and no other thing whatever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7965,696-93314-0051,and gradually little by little the whole worth of life seemed to lie in the faint far chance of his being able to undo the one triumphantly impulsive and unreasoning action of his life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7966,696-93314-0052,but there are some acts that there is no undoing and the hell that had burned in his heart so fiercely when he had seen her in the other man's arms burned now with new bright lights and infernal flickering flame tongues and at last out of hell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7967,696-93314-0053,the onlooker reached out his hands and caught at prayer he caught at it as a drowning man catches at a white gleam in the black of the surging sea about him it may be a painted spar it may be empty foam the onlooker prayed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7968,696-93314-0054,yes speaking professionally i think you are wrong you lessen your chances of life why don't you try a complete change because if you must know my chances of life have ceased to interest me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7969,696-93314-0055,the lover was short with the onlooker but he persisted well if one isn't interested in one's life one may be interested in one's death or the manner of it in your place i should enlist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7970,696-93314-0056,it's better to die of a bullet in south africa than of fright in london that roused the lover as it was meant to do i don't really know what business it is of yours sir he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7971,696-93314-0057,but it's your business to know that they wouldn't pass a man with a heart like mine i don't know they're not so particular just now they want men i should try it if i were you if you don't have a complete change you'll go all to pieces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7972,696-93314-0058,that's all the onlooker got out at the next station short of owning to his own lie he had done what he could to insure its being found out for the lie it was or at least for a mistake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7973,696-93314-0059,and when he had done what he could he saw that the lover might not find it out might be passed for the army might go to the front might be killed and then well i've done my best anyhow he said to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7974,696-93314-0060,and himself answered him liar you have not done your best you will have to eat your lie yes though it will smash your life and ruin you socially and professionally you will have to tell him you lied and tell him why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7975,696-93314-0061,you will never let him go to south africa without telling him the truth and you know it well you know best i suppose he said to himself but are you perfectly certain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7976,696-93314-0062,ye'll mak a fine soldier my lad i think not said the lover and he went out from the presence this time he reeled like a man too drunk to care how drunk he looks he drove in cabs from harley street to wimpole street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7977,696-93314-0063,when he had told the girl everything and when she was able to do anything but laugh and cry and cling to him with thin hands she said dear i do so hate to think badly of anyone but do you really think that man was mistaken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7978,696-93314-0064,he's very very clever my child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7979,696-93314-0065,don't mean that i know you're all right thank god oh thank god i mean don't you think he may have lied to you to prevent your marrying me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7980,696-93314-0066,why should he he asked me to marry him three weeks ago he's a very old friend of ours i do hate to be suspicious but it is odd and then his trying to get you to south africa,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7981,696-93314-0067,i'm certain he wanted you out of the way he wanted you to get killed oh how can people be so cruel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7982,8629-261140-0000,and gradually subside so this crowd yielded to its awe and man by man sank back into his seat till quiet was again restored and only a circle of listening faces confronted the man who had just stirred a whole roomful to its depths,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7983,8629-261140-0001,seeing this and realising his opportunity frederick at once entered into the explanations for which each heart there panted this will be overwhelming news to him who has cared for me since infancy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7984,8629-261140-0002,you have heard him call me son with what words shall i overthrow his confidence in the truth and rectitude of his long buried wife and make him know in his old age that he has wasted years of patience upon one who was not of his blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7985,8629-261140-0003,or lineage the wonder the incredulity you manifest are my best excuse for my long delay in revealing the secret entrusted to me by this dying woman an awed silence greeted these words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7986,8629-261140-0004,the astounding fact which i have just communicated to you was made known by my mother with the dagger still plunged in her breast she would not let me draw it out she knew that death would follow that act,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7987,8629-261140-0005,and she prized every moment remaining to her because of the bliss she enjoyed of seeing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7988,8629-261140-0006,the love the passion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7989,8629-261140-0007,transformed me in an instant from a selfish brute into a deeply repentant man i knelt before her in anguish i made her feel that wicked as i had been i was not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7990,8629-261140-0008,and when i saw by her clearing brow and peaceful look that i had fully persuaded her of this i let her speak what words she would and tell as she was able,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7991,8629-261140-0009,it is a sacred story to me and if you must know it let it be from her own words in the letters she left behind her she only told me that to save me from the fate of the children who had preceded me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7992,8629-261140-0010,and under circumstances calculated to deceive mister sutherland consequently he had never known i was not his own child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7993,8629-261140-0011,she enjoined me not to enlighten him now if by any sacrifice on my part i could rightfully avoid it that she was happy in having me hear the truth before she died that the joy which this gave her was so great,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7994,8629-261140-0012,she did not regret her fatal act violent and uncalled for as it was for it had showed her my heart and allowed me to read hers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7995,8629-261140-0013,and she made me promise i would care for him to the last with tenderness saying that i would be able to do this without seeming impropriety since she had willed me all her fortune under this proviso finally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7996,8629-261140-0014,and though her strength and breath were fast failing her she made me understand that she was worried about the zabels who had not come according to a sacred custom between them to celebrate the anniversary of her wedding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7997,8629-261140-0015,and prayed me to see the two old gentlemen before i slept since nothing but death or dire distress would have kept them from gratifying the one whim of my father's failing mind i promised,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7998,8629-261140-0016,she pointed to the dagger in her breast but before i could lay my hand upon it she called for batsy i want her to hear me declare before i go said she that this stroke was delivered by myself upon myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
7999,8629-261140-0017,but when i rose to look for batsy i found that the shock of her mistress's fatal act had killed her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8000,8629-261140-0018,in case my presence in this house of death should become known,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8001,8629-261140-0019,for fear it would make her last moments miserable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8002,8629-261140-0020,but was too terrified to move or speak and this satisfied my mother and made her last breath one of trust and contented love she died as i drew the dagger from her breast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8003,8629-261140-0021,and flung it wildly from the window then i lifted her and laid her where you found her on the sofa,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8004,8629-261140-0022,james zabel much less that it bore his initials on the handle he paused and the awe occasioned by the scene he had described was so deep and the silence so prolonged that a shudder passed over the whole assemblage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8005,8629-261140-0023,when from some unknown quarter a single cutting voice arose in this one short mocking comment oh the fairy tale was it amabel who spoke some thought so and looked her way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8006,8629-261140-0024,as if begging pardon for the wicked doubts which had driven him to this defence frederick met that look with one so severe it partook of harshness then resuming his testimony he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8007,8629-261140-0025,and of how one of them james by name came to be involved in this affair when i left my dead mother's side i was in such a state of mind that i passed with scarcely so much as a glance the room where my new found father sat sleeping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8008,8629-261140-0026,but as i hastened on toward the quarter where the zabels lived i was seized by such compunction for his desolate state that i faltered in my rapid flight and did not arrive at the place of my destination as quickly as i intended when i did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8009,8629-261140-0027,but i did not turn away remembering my mother's anxiety an anxiety so extreme it disturbed her final moments i approached the front door and was about to knock when i found it open greatly astonished i at once passed in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8010,8629-261140-0028,and seeing my way perfectly in the moonlight entered the room on the left the door of which also stood open it was the second house i had entered unannounced that night and in this as in the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8011,8629-261140-0029,i encountered a man sitting asleep by the table it was john the elder of the two and perceiving that he was suffering for food and in a condition of extreme misery i took out the first bill my hand encountered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8012,8629-261140-0030,as i did so he gave a sigh but did not wake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8013,8629-261140-0031,i hastened away and took the shortest path home had i been more of a man or if my visit to missus webb had been actuated by a more communicable motive i would have gone at once to the good man who believed me to be of his own flesh and blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8014,8629-261140-0032,and told him of the strange and heart rending adventure which had changed the whole tenor of my thoughts and life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8015,8629-261140-0033,in which i found myself placed but the memory of a thousand past ingratitudes together with the knowledge of the shock which he could not fail to receive on learning at this late day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8016,8629-261140-0034,was neither of her blood nor his rose up between us and caused me not only to attempt silence but to secrete in the adjoining woods the money i had received in the vain hope that all visible connection between myself and my mother's tragic death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8017,8629-261140-0035,would thus be lost you see i had not calculated on miss amabel page,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8018,8629-261140-0036,startled the crowd and gave sweetwater already suffering under shock after shock of mingled surprise and wonder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8019,8629-261140-0037,and that something besides justice had actuated amabel in her treatment of this young man this feeling was shared by others and a reaction set in in frederick's favour which even affected the officials who were conducting the inquiry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8020,8629-261140-0038,frederick himself felt the change and showed it by the look of relief and growing confidence he cast at agnes of the questions and answers which now passed between him and the various members of the jury i need give no account,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8021,8629-261140-0039,they but emphasised facts already known and produced but little change in the general feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8022,8629-261140-0040,when he was allowed to resume his seat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8023,8629-261140-0041,she rose with a bound nought that she had anticipated had occurred facts of which she could know nothing had changed the aspect of affairs and made the position of frederick something so remote from any she could have imagined,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8024,8629-261140-0042,that she was still in the maze of the numberless conflicting emotions which these revelations were calculated to call out in one who had risked all on the hazard of a die and lost she did not even know at this moment whether she was glad or sorry he could explain so cleverly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8025,8629-261140-0043,she had not a pure enough heart to do so to her all self sacrifice was an anomaly no woman of the mental or physical strength of agatha webb would plant a dagger in her own breast just to prevent another person from committing a crime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8026,8629-261140-0044,were he lover husband or son so amabel believed and so would these others believe also when once relieved of the magnetic personality of this extraordinary witness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8027,8629-261140-0045,yet how thrilling it had been to hear him plead his cause so well it was almost worth the loss of her revenge to meet his look of hate and dream of the possibility of turning it later into the old look of love yes yes she loved him now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8028,8629-261140-0046,not even for his money for she could contemplate its loss but for himself who had so boldly shown that he was stronger than she and could triumph over her by the sheer force of his masculine daring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8029,8629-261140-0047,with such feelings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8030,8629-261140-0048,how conduct herself under questions which would be much more searching now than before she could not even decide in her own mind she must let impulse have its way happily she took the right stand at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8031,8629-261140-0049,she did not endeavour to make any corrections in her former testimony only acknowledging that the flower whose presence on the scene of death had been such a mystery had fallen from her hair at the ball and that she had seen frederick pick it up and put it in his buttonhole,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8032,8629-261140-0050,beyond this and the inferences it afterward awakened in her mind she would not go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8033,8629-261139-0000,all the witnesses who had anything to say had long ago given in their testimony and when at or near noon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8034,8629-261139-0001,it was to find in two faces only any signs of the eagerness and expectancy which filled his own breast to suffocation but as these faces were those of agnes halliday and amabel page,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8035,8629-261139-0002,he soon recognised that his own judgment was not at fault and that notwithstanding outward appearances and the languid interest shown in the now lagging proceedings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8036,8629-261139-0003,but vital consequence frederick was not visible in the great hall but that he was near at hand soon became evident from the change sweetwater now saw in amabel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8037,8629-261139-0004,for while she had hitherto sat under the universal gaze with only the faint smile of conscious beauty on her inscrutable features,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8038,8629-261139-0005,and glanced at the great door of entrance with an evil expectancy that startled even sweetwater so little had he really understood the nature of the passions labouring in that venomous breast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8039,8629-261139-0006,smiled as she met his eye with that curious slow dipping of her dimples which had more than once confounded the coroner and rendered her at once the admiration and abhorrence of the crowd,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8040,8629-261139-0007,looked away as soon as possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8041,8629-261139-0008,from which he had removed the ring which up to this hour he had invariably worn on his third finger in this glance of hers and this action of his began the struggle that was to make that day memorable in many hearts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8042,8629-261139-0009,and to him a full attention was being given in the hope that some real enlightenment would come at last to settle the questions which had been raised by amabel's incomplete and unsatisfactory testimony but no man can furnish what he does not possess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8043,8629-261139-0010,and the few final minutes before noon passed by without any addition being made to the facts which had already been presented for general consideration as the witness sat down the clock began to strike as the slow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8044,8629-261139-0011,hesitating strokes rang out sweetwater saw frederick yield to a sudden but most profound emotion the old fear which we understand if sweetwater did not had again seized the victim of amabel's ambition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8045,8629-261139-0012,with a fell and steady purpose he found his right hand stealing toward the left in the significant action she expected better to yield than fall headlong into the pit one word of hers would open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8046,8629-261139-0013,he had not meant to yield but now that the moment had come now that he must at once and forever choose between a course that led simply to personal unhappiness and one that involved not only himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8047,8629-261139-0014,but those dearest to him in disgrace and sorrow he felt himself weaken to the point of clutching at whatever would save him from the consequences of confession moral strength and that tenacity of purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8048,8629-261139-0015,which only comes from years of self control were too lately awakened in his breast to sustain him now as stroke after stroke fell on the ear he felt himself yielding beyond recovery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8049,8629-261139-0016,and had almost touched his finger in the significant action of assent which amabel awaited with breathless expectation when was it miracle or only the suggestion of his better nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8050,8629-261139-0017,the memory of a face full of holy pleading rose from the past before his eyes and with an inner cry of mother he flung his hand out and clutched his father's arm in a way to break the charm of his own dread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8051,8629-261139-0018,and end forever the effects of the intolerable fascination that was working upon him next minute the last stroke of noon rang out and the hour was up which amabel had set as the limit of her silence a pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8052,8629-261139-0019,which to their two hearts if to no others seemed strangely appropriate followed the cessation of these sounds then the witness was dismissed and amabel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8053,8629-261139-0020,when frederick leaping with a bound to his feet drew all eyes towards himself with the cry let me be put on my oath i have testimony to give of the utmost importance in this case the coroner was astounded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8054,8629-261139-0021,everyone was astounded no one had expected anything from him and instinctively every eye turned towards amabel to see how she was affected by his action strangely evidently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8055,8629-261139-0022,ever forgot though it conveyed no hint of her real feelings which were somewhat chaotic frederick who had forgotten her now that he had made up his mind to speak waited for the coroner's reply if you have testimony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8056,8629-261139-0023,said that gentleman after exchanging a few hurried words with mister courtney and the surprised knapp you can do no better than give it to us at once mister frederick sutherland will you take the stand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8057,8629-261139-0024,with a noble air from which all hesitation had vanished frederick started towards the place indicated but stopped before he had taken a half dozen steps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8058,8629-261139-0025,go he whispered but in so thrilling a tone it was heard to the remotest corner of the room spare me the anguish of saying what i have to say in your presence i could not bear it you could not bear it later,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8059,8629-261139-0026,if you will wait for me in one of these rooms i will repeat my tale in your ears but go now it is my last entreaty there was a silence no one ventured a dissent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8060,8629-261139-0027,no one so much as made a gesture of disapproval then mister sutherland struggled to his feet cast one last look around him and disappeared through a door which had opened like magic before him then and not till then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8061,8629-261139-0028,did frederick move forward the moment was intense the coroner seemed to share the universal excitement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8062,8629-261139-0029,this you will believe when i tell you that i was the person miss page followed into missus webb's house and whom she heard descend the stairs during the moment she crouched behind the figure of the sleeping philemon it was more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8063,8629-261139-0030,infinitely more than anyone there had expected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8064,8629-261139-0031,and the shock the surprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8065,8629-261139-0032,was almost appalling in its intensity had it not been for the consciousness of mister sutherland's near presence the feeling would have risen to outbreak and many voices were held in subjection by the remembrance of this venerated man's last look,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8066,8629-261139-0033,that otherwise would have made themselves heard in despite of the restrictions of the place and the authority of the police to frederick it was a moment of immeasurable grief and humiliation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8067,8629-261139-0034,on every face in every shrinking form in subdued murmurs and open cries he read instant and complete condemnation and yet in all his life from boyhood up to this hour never had he been so worthy of their esteem and consideration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8068,8629-261139-0035,he did not lose his determined attitude he had observed a change in amabel and a change in agnes and if only to disappoint the vile triumph of the one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8069,8629-261139-0036,he withstood the clamour and began speaking again before the coroner had been able to fully restore quiet i know said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8070,8629-261139-0037,but if anyone who listens to me thinks me guilty of the death i was so unfortunate as to have witnessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8071,8629-261139-0038,doctor talbot and you gentlemen of the jury in the face of god and man i here declare that missus webb in my presence and before my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8072,8629-261139-0039,gave to herself the blow which has robbed us all of a most valuable life she was not murdered it was a solemn assertion but it failed to convince the crowd before him as by one impulse men and women broke into a tumult,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8073,8629-261139-0040,she was too good it's all calumny a wretched lie broke in unrestrained excitement from every part of the large room in vain the coroner smote with his gavel in vain the local police endeavoured to restore order,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8074,8629-261139-0041,the tide was up and over swept everything for an instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8075,8629-261139-0042,of amabel smoothing out the folds of her crisp white frock with an incredulous almost insulting smile that at once fixed attention again on frederick he seized the occasion and spoke up in a tone of great resolve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8076,8629-261139-0043,i have made an assertion said he before god and before this jury to make it seem a credible one i shall have to tell my own story from the beginning am i allowed to do so mister coroner you are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8077,8629-261139-0044,was the firm response then gentlemen continued frederick still without looking at amabel whose smile had acquired a mockery that drew the eyes of the jury toward her more than once during the following recital,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8078,8629-261139-0045,you know and the public generally now know that missus webb has left me the greater portion of the money of which she died possessed i have never before acknowledged to anyone not even to the good man who awaits this jury's verdict,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8079,8629-261139-0046,on the other side of that door yonder that she had reasons for this good reasons reasons of which up to the very evening of her death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8080,8629-261139-0047,or that i was the special object of her attention or that we were under any mutual obligations in any way why then i should have thought of going to her in the great strait in which i found myself on that day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8081,8629-261139-0048,i cannot say i knew she had money in her house this i had unhappily been made acquainted with in an accidental way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8082,8629-261139-0049,and quite capable of doing a very unselfish act still this would not seem to be reason enough for me to intrude upon her late at night with a plea for a large loan of money had i not been in a desperate condition of mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8083,8629-261139-0050,which made any attempt seem reasonable that promised relief from the unendurable burden of a pressing and disreputable debt i was obliged to have money a great deal of money and i had to have it at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8084,8629-261139-0051,as i had been told early in the evening a small entertainment was being given which would insure its being open even at so late an hour as midnight miss page who will i am sure pardon the introduction of her name into this narrative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8085,8629-261139-0052,has taken pains to declare to you that in the expedition she herself made into town that evening she followed some person's steps down hill this is very likely true and those steps were probably mine for after leaving the house by the garden door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8086,8629-261139-0053,and so hastened on till i came to the gate on high street here i had a moment of hesitation and thoughts bitter enough for me to recall them at this moment came into my mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8087,8629-261139-0054,but they passed thank god and with no more desperate feeling than a sullen intention of having my own way about this money i lifted the latch of the front door and stepped in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8088,8629-261139-0055,or at least to hear the sound of merry voices and laughter in the rooms above but no sounds of any sort awaited me indeed the house seemed strangely silent for one so fully lighted and astonished at this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8089,8629-261139-0056,i pushed the door ajar at my left and looked in an unexpected and pitiful sight awaited me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8090,8629-261139-0057,i saw the master of the house with his head sunk forward on his arms asleep the expected guests had failed to arrive and he tired out with waiting had fallen into a doze at the board,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8091,8629-261139-0058,this was a condition of things for which i was not prepared missus webb whom i wished to see was probably up stairs and while i might summon her by a sturdy rap on the door beside which i stood i had so little desire to wake her husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8092,8629-261139-0059,of whose mental condition i was well aware that i could not bring myself to make any loud noise within his hearing yet i had not the courage to retreat all my hope of relief from the many difficulties that menaced me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8093,8629-261139-0060,lay in the generosity of this great hearted woman and if out of pusillanimity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8094,8629-261139-0061,nothing but shame and disaster awaited me yet how could i hope to lure her down stairs without noise i could not and so yielding to the impulse of the moment without any realisation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8095,8629-261139-0062,i slipped up the narrow staircase,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8096,8629-261139-0063,for she rose and meeting my eye with a gaze in which shock and some strange and poignant agony totally incomprehensible to me were strangely blended she cried out no no frederick you don't know what you are doing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8097,8629-261139-0064,if you want my money take it if you want my life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8098,8629-261139-0065,don't stain yours don't i did not understand her i did not know until i thought it over afterward that my hand was thrust convulsively into my breast in a way which taken with my wild mien,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8099,8629-261139-0066,give then i want hundreds thousands now now to save myself disgrace shame prison await me if i don't have them give give and my hand went out toward it not toward her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8100,8629-261139-0067,but she mistook the action mistook my purpose and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8101,8629-261139-0068,more than the outward seeming of her life can hardly measure plunged against it and i can tell you no more her blood and batsy's shriek from the adjoining room swam through my consciousness and then she fell as i supposed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8102,8629-261139-0069,and i in scarcely better case fell also this as god lives is the truth concerning the wound found in the breast of this never to be forgotten woman the feeling the pathos the anguish even to be found in his tone made this story,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8103,8629-261139-0070,seemed appear for the moment plausible and batsy asked the coroner must have fallen when we did for i never heard her voice after the first scream but i shall speak of her again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8104,8629-261139-0071,what i must now explain is how the money in missus webb's drawer came into my possession and how the dagger she had planted in her breast came to be found on the lawn outside when i came to myself and that must have been very soon i found,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8105,8629-261139-0072,that the blow of which i had been such a horrified witness had not yet proved fatal the eyes i had seen close as i had supposed forever were now open and she was looking at me with a smile that has never left my memory and never will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8106,8629-261139-0073,there is no blood on you she murmured you did not strike the blow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8108,8629-261139-0075,do these words this action of hers seem incredible to you sirs alas alas they will not when i tell you and here he cast one anxious deeply anxious glance at the room in which mister sutherland was hidden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8111,1235-135887-0001,there was in the country of yunaun or greece a king who was leprous and his physicians had in vain endeavoured his cure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8114,1235-135887-0004,or external applications the king listened to what he said and answered if you be able to perform what you promise i will enrich you and your posterity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8126,1235-135887-0016,bowed himself before the throne with his face to the ground the king perceiving him made him sit down by his side presented him to the assembly and gave him all the commendation he deserved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8127,1235-135887-0017,but as he treated all his court that day made him eat at his table alone with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8128,1235-135887-0018,but caused him to be clad in a rich robe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8129,1235-135887-0019,continued every day to load him with new favours but this king had a vizier who was avaricious envious and naturally capable of every kind of mischief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8130,1235-135887-0020,he could not behold without envy the presents that were given to the physician whose other merits had already begun to make him jealous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8131,1235-135887-0021,to effect this he went to the king and told him in private that he had some information of the greatest consequence to communicate the king having asked what it was sire said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8132,1235-135887-0022,it is highly dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose fidelity he has never tried,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8133,1235-135887-0023,i am well informed of what i have had the honour to reveal to your majesty therefore do not rest in dangerous security if your majesty be asleep be pleased to awake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8134,1235-135887-0024,and came to settle himself at your court for the sole purpose of executing the horrible design which i have intimated no no vizier interrupted the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8135,1235-135887-0025,i am certain that this physician whom you suspect to be a villain and a traitor is one of the best and most virtuous of men you know by what medicine or rather by what miracle he cured me of my leprosy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8136,1235-135887-0026,if he had had a design upon my life why did he save me then he needed only to have left me to my disease i could not have escaped it as life was fast decaying forbear then to fill me with unjust suspicions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8137,1235-135887-0027,instead of listening to you i tell you that from this day forward i will give that great man a pension of a thousand pieces of gold per month for his life nay though i were to share with him all my riches and dominions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8138,1235-135887-0028,i should never pay him sufficiently for what he has done i perceive it to be his virtue that raises your envy but do not think i will be unjustly prejudiced against him i remember too well what a vizier said to king sinbad his master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8139,1235-135887-0029,to prevent his putting to death the prince his son what the grecian king said about king sinbad raised the vizier's curiosity who said i pray your majesty to pardon me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8140,1235-135887-0030,if i have the boldness to ask what the vizier of king sinbad said to his master to divert him from putting the prince his son to death the grecian king had the condescension to satisfy him that vizier said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8141,1235-135887-0031,after having represented to king sinbad that he ought to beware lest on the accusation of a mother in law he should commit an action of which he might afterwards repent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8142,1235-135884-0000,what is more my wife she was only twelve years of age when i married her so that i may justly say she ought to regard me equally as her father her kinsman and her husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8143,1235-135884-0001,we lived together twenty years without any children her barrenness did not effect any change in my love i still treated her with much kindness and affection,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8144,1235-135884-0002,my desire of having children only induced me to purchase a slave by whom i had a son who was extremely promising my wife being jealous cherished a hatred for both mother and child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8145,1235-135884-0003,but concealed her aversion so well that i knew nothing of it till it was too late mean time my son grew up and was ten years old when i was obliged to undertake a long journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8146,1235-135884-0004,before i went i recommended to my wife of whom i had no mistrust the slave and her son and prayed her to take care of them during my absence which was to be for a whole year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8147,1235-135884-0005,she however employed that time to satisfy her hatred she applied herself to magic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8148,1235-135884-0006,the wretch carried my son to a desolate place where by her enchantments she changed him into a calf and gave him to my farmer to fatten pretending she had bought him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8149,1235-135884-0007,her enmity did not stop at this abominable action but she likewise changed the slave into a cow and gave her also to my farmer at my return i enquired for the mother and child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8150,1235-135884-0008,your slave said she is dead and as for your son i know not what is become of him i have not seen him this two months i was afflicted at the death of the slave,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8151,1235-135884-0009,but as she informed me my son had only disappeared i was in hopes he would shortly return however eight months passed and i heard nothing of him when the festival of the great bairam was to be celebrated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8152,1235-135884-0010,the unfortunate mother of my son i bound her but as i was going to sacrifice her she bellowed piteously and i could perceive tears streaming from her eyes this seemed to me very extraordinary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8153,1235-135884-0011,and finding myself moved with compassion i could not find in my heart to give her a blow but ordered my farmer to get me another my wife who was present was enraged at my tenderness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8154,1235-135884-0012,and resisting an order which disappointed her malice she cried out what are you doing husband sacrifice that cow your farmer has not a finer nor one fitter for the festival out of deference to my wife i came again to the cow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8155,1235-135884-0013,and combating my compassion which suspended the sacrifice was going to give her the fatal blow when the victim redoubling her tears and bellowing disarmed me a second time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8156,1235-135884-0014,i then put the mallet into the farmer's hands and desired him to take it and sacrifice her himself for her tears and bellowing pierced my heart the farmer less compassionate than myself sacrificed her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8157,1235-135884-0015,though to she seemed very fat take her yourself said i to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8158,1235-135884-0016,i did not enquire what he did with the cow but soon after he had taken her away he returned with a fat calf though i knew not the calf was my son yet i could not forbear being moved at the sight of him on his part,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8159,1235-135884-0017,as soon as he beheld me he made so great an effort to come near me that he broke his cord,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8160,1235-135884-0018,with his head against the ground as if he meant to excite my compassion conjuring me not to be so cruel as to take his life and did as much as was possible for him to signify that he was my son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8161,1235-135884-0019,i was more surprised and affected with this action than with the tears of the cow i felt a tender pity which interested me on his behalf or rather nature did its duty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8162,1235-135884-0020,go said i to the farmer carry home that calf take great care of him and bring me another in his stead immediately as soon as my wife heard me give this order she exclaimed what are you about husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8163,1235-135884-0021,take my advice sacrifice no other calf but that wife i replied i will not sacrifice him i will spare him and pray do not you oppose me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8164,1235-135884-0022,the wicked woman had no regard to my wishes she hated my son too much to consent that i should save him i tied the poor creature and taking up the fatal knife was going to plunge it into my son's throat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8165,1235-135884-0023,when turning his eyes bathed with tears in a languishing manner towards me he affected me so much that i had not strength to kill him i let the knife fall and told my wife positively,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8166,1235-135884-0024,that i would have another calf to sacrifice and not that she used all her endeavours to persuade me to change my resolution but i continued firm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8168,1235-135884-0026,these two metamorphoses were made by the enchantments of our master's wife who hated both the mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8169,1235-135884-0027,this is what my daughter told me said the farmer and i come to acquaint you with it i leave you to judge how much i was surprised i went immediately to my farmer to speak to his daughter myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8170,1235-135884-0028,as soon as i arrived i went forthwith to the stall where my son was kept he could not return my embraces but received them in such a manner as fully satisfied me he was my son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8171,1235-135884-0029,my good maid said i can you restore my son to his former shape yes she replied i can,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8172,1235-135884-0030,except on two conditions the first is that you give him to me for my husband and the second that you allow me to punish the person who changed him into a calf as to the first i replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8173,1235-135884-0031,as to what relates to my wife i also agree a person who has been capable of committing such a criminal action justly deserves to be punished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8174,1235-135884-0032,only i must pray you not to take her life i am going then answered she to treat her as she treated your son to this i consent said i,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8175,1235-135884-0033,provided you first of all restore to me my son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8177,1235-135884-0035,but if thou be a man and art changed into a calf by enchantment return to thy natural shape by the permission of the sovereign creator as she spoke she threw water upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8178,1235-135884-0036,and in an instant he recovered his natural form my son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8179,1235-135884-0037,with such a transport of joy that i knew not what i was doing it is heaven that hath sent us this young maid to remove the horrible charm by which you were enchanted and to avenge the injury done to you and your mother i doubt not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8180,1235-135884-0038,but in acknowledgment you will make your deliverer your wife as i have promised he joyfully consented but before they married she changed my wife into a hind and this is she whom you see here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8181,1235-135884-0039,i desired she might have this shape rather than another less agreeable that we might see her in the family without horror since that time my son is become a widower and gone to travel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8182,1235-135884-0040,it being now several years since i heard of him i am come abroad to inquire after him and not being willing to trust anybody with my wife till i should return home i thought fit to take her everywhere with me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8183,1235-135884-0041,this is the history of myself and this hind is it not one of the most wonderful and surprising i admit it is said the genie and on that account forgive the merchant one third of his crime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8184,1235-135883-0000,he was obliged from time to time to visit his correspondents on business and one day being under the necessity of going a long journey on an affair of importance he took horse and carried with him a wallet containing biscuits and dates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8185,1235-135883-0001,because he had a great desert to pass over where he could procure no sort of provisions he arrived without any accident at the end of his journey and having dispatched his affairs took horse again in order to return home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8186,1235-135883-0002,the fourth day of his journey he was so much incommoded by the heat of the sun and the reflection of that heat from the earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8187,1235-135883-0003,having alighted he tied his horse to a branch and sitting down by the fountain took some biscuits and dates out of his wallet as he ate his dates he threw the shells carelessly in different directions when he had finished his repast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8188,1235-135883-0004,being a good moosulmaun he washed his hands face and feet and said his prayers before he had finished and while he was yet on his knees he saw a genie white with age,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8189,1235-135883-0005,the genie spoke to him in a terrible voice rise that i may kill thee with this cimeter as thou hast killed my son and accompanied these words with a frightful cry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8190,1235-135883-0006,the merchant being as much alarmed at the hideous shape of the monster as at his threatening language answered him trembling alas my good lord of what crime can i be guilty towards you that you should take away my life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8191,1235-135883-0007,demanded the genie did you not take dates out of your wallet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8192,1235-135883-0008,i did all that you say answered the merchant i cannot deny it if it be so resumed the genie i tell thee that thou hast killed my son and in this manner when thou wert throwing the shells about my son was passing by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8193,1235-135883-0009,and thou didst throw one into his eye which killed him therefore i must kill thee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8194,1235-135883-0010,pardon me cried the merchant no pardon exclaimed the genie no mercy is it not just to kill him that has killed another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8195,1235-135883-0011,replied the merchant but certainly i never killed your son and if i have it was unknown to me and i did it innocently i beg you therefore to pardon me and suffer me to live no no returned the genie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8196,1235-135883-0012,persisting in his resolution i must kill thee since thou hast killed my son then taking the merchant by the arm he threw him with his face on the ground and lifted up his cimeter to cut off his head the merchant with tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8197,1235-135883-0013,protested he was innocent bewailed his wife and children and supplicated the genie in the most moving expressions the genie with his cimeter still lifted up had the patience to hear his unfortunate victims to the end of his lamentations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8198,1235-135883-0014,all this whining said the monster is to no purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8199,1235-135883-0015,what exclaimed the merchant can nothing prevail with you will you absolutely take away the life of a poor innocent yes replied the genie i am resolved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8200,1235-135883-0016,as soon as she had spoken these words perceiving it was day and knowing that the sultan rose early in the morning to say his prayers and hold his council scheherazade discontinued her story dear sister said dinarzade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8201,1235-135883-0017,the remainder of it replied scheherazade is more surprising and you will be of this opinion if the sultan will but permit me to live over this day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8202,1235-135883-0018,i will wait till to morrow for i can at any time put her to death when she has concluded her story having thus resolved not to put scheherazade to death that day he rose and went to his prayers and to attend his council,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8203,1235-135883-0019,instead of sleeping he spent the night in sighs and groans bewailing the lot of his daughter of whom he believed he should himself shortly be the executioner as with this melancholy prospect before him he dreaded to meet the sultan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8204,1235-135883-0020,he was agreeably surprised when he found the prince entered the council chamber without giving him the fatal orders he expected the sultan according to his custom spent the day in regulating his affairs and when the night had closed in retired with scheherazade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8205,1235-135883-0021,the next morning before day dinarzade failed not to call to her sister my dear sister if you be not asleep i pray you till day break which is very near to go on with the story you began last night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8206,1235-135883-0022,the sultan without waiting for scheherazade to ask his permission bade her proceed with the story of the genie and the merchant upon which scheherazade continued her relation as follows f n,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8207,1235-135883-0023,in the original work scheherazade continually breaks off to ask the sultan to spare her life for another day that she may finish the story she is relating as these interruptions considerably interfere with the continued interest of the stories it has been deemed advisable to omit them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8208,1235-135883-0024,for heaven's sake hold your hand allow me one word,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8210,1235-135883-0026,that they may not go to law after my death when i have done this i will come back and submit to whatever you shall please to command but said the genie if i grant you the time you ask i doubt you will never return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8211,1235-135883-0027,if you will believe my oath answered the merchant i swear by all that is sacred that i will come and meet you here without fail what time do you require then demanded the genie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8212,1235-135883-0028,i ask a year said the merchant i cannot in less settle my affairs and prepare myself to die without regret but i promise you that this day twelve months i will return under these trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8213,1235-135883-0029,to put myself into your hands do you take heaven to be witness to this promise said the genie i do answered the merchant and you may rely on my oath upon this the genie left him near the fountain and disappeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8214,1235-135883-0030,the merchant being recovered from his terror mounted his horse and proceeded on his journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8215,1235-135883-0031,but grieved on the other when he reflected on his fatal oath when he reached home his wife and children received him with all the demonstrations of perfect joy but he instead of returning their caresses wept so bitterly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8216,1235-135883-0032,that his family apprehended something calamitous had befallen him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8217,1235-135883-0033,we are all overjoyed said she at your return but you alarm us by your lamentations pray tell us the cause of your sorrow alas replied the husband i have but a year to live,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8218,1235-135883-0034,he then related what had passed betwixt him and the genie and informed her that he had given him his oath to return at the end of the year to receive death from his hands when they heard this afflicting intelligence they all began to lament in the most distressing manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8219,1235-135883-0035,the children all in tears made the house resound with their groans and the father not being able to resist the impulse of nature mingled his tears with theirs so that in a word they exhibited the most affecting spectacle possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8220,1235-135883-0036,on the following morning the merchant applied himself to put his affairs in order and first of all to pay his debts he made presents to his friends gave liberal alms to the poor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8221,1235-135883-0037,he gave her in addition as much as the law would allow him at last the year expired and he was obliged to depart he put his burial clothes in his wallet but when he came to bid his wife and children adieu their grief surpassed description,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8222,1235-135883-0038,when however it became necessary for him to tear himself from these dear objects he addressed them in the following terms my dear wife and children i obey the will of heaven in quitting you follow my example,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8223,1235-135883-0039,submit with fortitude to this necessity and consider that it is the destiny of man to die having thus spoken he went out of the hearing of the cries of his family and pursuing his journey arrived on the day appointed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8224,1235-135883-0040,an old man leading a hind appeared and drew near him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8225,1235-135883-0041,brother may i ask why you are come into this desert place which is possessed solely by evil spirits and where consequently you cannot be safe from the beautiful trees which are seen here one might indeed suppose the place inhabited,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8226,1235-135883-0042,he then seated himself by the merchant and they entered into conversation but i see day said scheherazade and must leave off yet the best of the story is to come the sultan resolving to hear the end of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8227,1235-135883-0043,suffered her to live that day also the next morning dinarzade made the same request to her sister as before my dear sister said she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8228,1235-135883-0044,but the sultan wishing to learn what followed betwixt the merchant and the genie bade her proceed with that which she did as follows sir while the merchant and the old man who led the hind were conversing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8229,1235-135883-0045,they saw another old man coming towards them followed by two black dogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8230,1235-135883-0046,the old man with the hind told him the adventure of the merchant and genie with all that had passed between them particularly the merchant's oath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8231,1235-135883-0047,they had scarcely begun to converse together when there arrived a third old man leading a mule he addressed himself to the two former and asked why the merchant who sat with them looked so melancholy they told him the reason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8232,1235-135883-0048,which appeared to him so extraordinary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8233,1235-135883-0049,the merchant and the three old men began to lament and fill the air with their cries when the old man who led the hind saw the genie lay hold of the merchant and about to kill him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8234,1235-135883-0050,i will tell you the history of my life and of the hind you see and if you think it more wonderful and surprising than the adventure of the merchant i hope you will pardon the unfortunate man a third of his offence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8235,730-358-0000,chapter eleven it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8236,730-358-0001,by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8237,730-358-0002,the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8238,730-358-0003,the light became more and more oppressive to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8239,730-358-0004,this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8240,730-358-0005,i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8241,730-358-0006,as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8242,730-358-0007,i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8243,730-358-0008,i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8244,730-358-0009,the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8245,730-358-0010,no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8246,730-358-0011,the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8247,730-358-0012,i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8248,730-358-0013,which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8249,730-358-0014,and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8250,730-358-0015,sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8251,730-358-0016,the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8252,730-358-0017,my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8253,730-358-0018,one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8254,730-358-0019,in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8255,730-358-0020,the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8256,730-358-0021,and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8257,730-358-0022,i observed this also,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8258,730-358-0023,when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8259,730-358-0024,and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8260,730-358-0025,and the nuts and roots much improved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8261,730-358-0026,when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8262,730-358-0027,and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8263,730-358-0028,i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8264,730-358-0029,the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8265,730-358-0030,this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8266,730-358-0031,his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8267,730-358-0032,after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8268,730-358-0033,i lay down among some straw and fell asleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8269,730-358-0034,which shone brightly on the white ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8270,730-358-0035,i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8271,730-358-0036,allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8272,730-358-0037,refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8273,730-358-0038,no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8274,730-358-0039,however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8275,730-358-0040,that i might view the adjacent cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8276,730-358-0041,one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8277,730-358-0042,all the light i enjoyed came through the sty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8278,730-358-0043,having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8279,730-358-0044,by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8280,730-358-0045,which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8281,730-358-0046,the rain dropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8282,730-358-0047,with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8283,730-358-0048,her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8284,730-358-0049,and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8285,730-358-0050,presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8286,730-358-0051,on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8287,730-358-0052,whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8288,730-358-0053,who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8289,730-358-0054,the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8290,730-358-0055,he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8291,730-358-0056,and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8292,730-358-0057,bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8293,730-358-0058,and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8294,730-358-0059,and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8295,730-358-0060,the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8296,730-358-0061,the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8297,730-358-0062,but to my extreme wonder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8298,730-358-0063,did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8299,730-358-0064,the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8300,730-359-0000,i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8301,730-359-0001,which influenced their actions the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8302,730-359-0002,this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8303,730-359-0003,employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8304,730-359-0004,and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8305,730-359-0005,they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8306,730-359-0006,it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8307,730-359-0007,they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one another's company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8308,730-359-0008,a considerable period elapsed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8309,730-359-0009,it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8310,730-359-0010,when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8311,730-359-0011,this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8312,730-359-0012,i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8313,730-359-0013,and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8314,730-359-0014,the young woman when she opened the door in the morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8315,730-359-0015,she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8316,730-359-0016,by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8317,730-359-0017,i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8318,730-359-0018,but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8319,730-359-0019,not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8320,730-359-0020,and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8321,730-359-0021,but the old man had only one which was father the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describe the delight i felt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8322,730-359-0022,when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8323,730-359-0023,as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8324,730-359-0024,when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathized in their joys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8325,730-359-0025,often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8326,730-359-0026,agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8327,730-359-0027,and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8328,730-359-0028,but if his countenance was more sorrowful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8329,730-359-0029,especially when he addressed the old man i could mention innumerable instances which although slight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8330,730-359-0030,in the midst of poverty and want,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8331,730-359-0031,from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8332,730-359-0032,where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8333,730-359-0033,he read to the old man and agatha this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8334,730-359-0034,that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8335,730-359-0035,of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8336,730-359-0036,to discover myself to the cottagers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8337,730-359-0037,which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8338,730-359-0038,as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8339,730-359-0039,from this time felix was more employed and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8340,730-359-0040,and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced the old man leaning on his son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8341,730-359-0041,my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8342,730-359-0042,when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was star light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8343,730-359-0043,and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8344,730-359-0044,my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8345,730-359-0045,that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8346,730-359-0046,i imagined that they would be disgusted until,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8347,730-359-0047,and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8348,730-359-0048,greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8349,730-359-0049,happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8350,730-359-0050,my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8351,730-360-0000,i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8352,730-360-0001,it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8353,730-360-0002,my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8354,730-360-0003,that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8355,730-360-0004,that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a country man as a guide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8356,730-360-0005,the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8357,730-360-0006,on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8358,730-360-0007,and her complexion wondrously fair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8359,730-360-0008,every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8360,730-360-0009,she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8361,730-360-0010,she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8362,730-360-0011,and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8363,730-360-0012,she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8364,730-360-0013,and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8365,730-360-0014,presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8366,730-360-0015,retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8367,730-360-0016,was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible the next morning felix went out to his work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8368,730-360-0017,and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8369,730-360-0018,when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8370,730-360-0019,the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8371,730-360-0020,the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8372,730-360-0021,in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8373,730-360-0022,in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8374,730-360-0023,although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8375,730-360-0024,my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8376,730-360-0025,who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8377,730-360-0026,the book from which felix instructed safie was volney's ruins of empires i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8378,730-360-0027,he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8379,730-360-0028,and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8380,730-360-0029,degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8381,730-360-0030,inhabitants these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8382,730-360-0031,and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8383,730-360-0032,a condition more abject than that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8384,730-360-0033,or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8385,730-360-0034,i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8410,83-9960-0014,it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8411,83-9960-0015,marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart breaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8412,83-9960-0016,in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again the prisoner made a movement in his bonds here's the bourgeoise said thenardier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8413,83-9960-0017,he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8419,83-9960-0023,and after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all i spoke to both the porter and the portress a fine stout woman and they know nothing about him marius breathed freely once more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8421,83-9960-0025,for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8422,83-9960-0026,finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious tone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8423,83-9960-0027,what did you expect to gain by that to gain time cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8424,83-9960-0028,the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8425,83-9960-0029,and had then straightened himself up again and now thenardier the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8426,83-9960-0030,stared at him in stupefaction as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the red hot chisel which emitted a threatening glow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8427,83-9960-0031,when the police made their descent on it this sou piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8428,83-9960-0032,are to jewellers work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry there are benvenuto cellinis in the galleys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8429,83-9960-0033,the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common wooden handled knife to saw a sou into two thin plates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8430,83-9960-0034,to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is a box,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8431,83-9960-0035,in this box he hides a watch spring and this watch spring properly handled cuts good sized chains and bars of iron the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou not at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8433,83-9960-0037,they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou it is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8434,83-9960-0038,as he had not been able to bend down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise be easy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8436,83-9960-0040,at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8437,83-9960-0041,the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8438,83-9960-0042,the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow the prisoner resumed do what you please with me he was disarmed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8439,83-9960-0043,seize him said thenardier two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked man with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8440,83-9960-0044,ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8441,83-9960-0045,there is only one thing left to do cut his throat that's it it was the husband and wife taking counsel together thenardier walked slowly towards the table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8442,83-9960-0046,opened the drawer and took out the knife marius fretted with the handle of his pistol unprecedented perplexity for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8443,83-9960-0047,the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony up to that moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8444,83-9960-0048,marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair all at once a shudder ran through him at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8445,83-9960-0049,this was the expedient of which he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him of sparing the assassin and saving the victim he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8446,83-9960-0050,softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round it and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den it was high time thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8448,83-9960-0052,thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle it's in eponine's handwriting the devil he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8453,83-3054-0000,a woman's life saved the cause of her falling into the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8454,83-3054-0001,i omitted several very material parts in my father's journey across the english channel to holland which that they may not be totally lost,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8455,83-3054-0002,i will now faithfully give you in his own words as i heard him relate them to his friends several times on my arrival says my father at helvoetsluys i was observed to breathe with some difficulty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8456,83-3054-0003,carrying their heads at the extremity of their tails i crossed continued he one prodigious range of rocks equal in height to the alps the tops or highest parts of these marine mountains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8457,83-3054-0004,are said to be upwards of one hundred fathoms below the surface of the sea on the sides of which there was a great variety of tall noble trees loaded with marine fruit such as lobsters crabs oysters scollops,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8458,83-3054-0005,fruit shook off the branches of the tree it grows upon by the motion of the water as those in our gardens are by that of the wind the lobster trees appeared the richest but the crab and oysters were the tallest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8459,83-3054-0006,the periwinkle is a kind of shrub it grows at the foot of the oyster tree and twines round it as the ivy does the oak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8460,83-3054-0007,as she sank she fell upon her side and forced a very large lobster tree out of its place it was in the spring when the lobsters were very young,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8461,83-3054-0008,and many of them being separated by the violence of the shock they fell upon a crab tree which was growing below them they have like the farina of plants united and produced a fish resembling both,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8462,83-3054-0009,i endeavoured to bring one with me but it was too cumbersome and my salt water pegasus seemed much displeased at every attempt to stop his career whilst i continued upon his back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8463,83-3054-0010,besides i was then though galloping over a mountain of rocks that lay about midway the passage at least five hundred fathom below the surface of the sea and began to find the want of air inconvenient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8464,83-3054-0011,therefore i had no inclination to prolong the time add to this my situation was in other respects very unpleasant i met many large fish who were if i could judge by their open mouths,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8465,83-3054-0012,not only able but really wished to devour us now as my rosinante was blind i had these hungry gentlemen's attempts to guard against in addition to my other difficulties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8466,83-3054-0013,as we drew near the dutch shore and the body of water over our heads did not exceed twenty fathoms i thought i saw a human figure in a female dress then lying on the sand before me with some signs of life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8467,83-3054-0014,when i came close i perceived her hand move i took it into mine and brought her on shore as a corpse an apothecary who had just been instructed by doctor hawes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8468,83-3054-0015,of london treated her properly and she recovered she was the rib of a man who commanded a vessel belonging to helvoetsluys he was just going out of port on a voyage when she hearing he had got a mistress with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8469,83-3054-0016,followed him in an open boat as soon as she had got on the quarter deck she flew at her husband and attempted to strike him with such impetuosity that he thought it most prudent to slip on one side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8470,83-3054-0017,and let her make the impression of her fingers upon the waves rather than his face he was not much out in his ideas of the consequence for meeting no opposition she went directly overboard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8471,83-3054-0018,and it was my unfortunate lot to lay the foundation for bringing this happy pair together again i can easily conceive what execrations the husband loaded me with when on his return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8472,83-3054-0019,he found this gentle creature waiting his arrival and learned the means by which she came into the world again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8473,83-11691-0000,this is a painful chapter for me to write mercifully it is to be a short one later on i shall become used to the situation inclined even to dwell upon its humorous side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8474,83-11691-0001,but for the moment i cannot see beyond the sadness of it that to a prince of the royal house of araby,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8475,83-11691-0002,roger scurvilegs frankly breaks down over it that abominable woman he says meaning of course belvane and he has hysterics for more than a page let us describe it calmly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8476,83-11691-0003,coronel came back from his stroll in the same casual way in which he had started,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8477,83-11691-0004,he was not thinking of udo he was wondering if princess hyacinth had an attendant of surpassing beauty or a dragon of surpassing malevolence if in fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8478,83-11691-0005,there were any adventures in euralia for a humble fellow like himself coronel said a small voice behind him he turned round indifferently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8479,83-11691-0006,he said isn't it time we were starting we aren't starting said the voice what's the matter what are you hiding in the bushes for whatever's the matter udo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8480,83-11691-0007,coronel stopped your royal highness's commands he began rather coldly there was an ominous sniffing from the bushes coronel said an unhappy voice at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8481,83-11691-0008,i think i'm coming out wondering what it all meant coronel waited in silence yes i am coming out coronel said the voice but you mustn't be surprised if i don't look very well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8482,83-11691-0009,i'm i'm coronel here i am said udo pathetically,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8483,83-11691-0010,it is difficult to say what he was save that there was an impression of magnificence about his person such magnificence anyhow as is given by an astrakhan trimmed fur coat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8484,83-11691-0011,coronel decided that it was an occasion for tact ah here you are he said cheerfully shall we get along don't be a fool coronel said udo almost crying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8485,83-11691-0012,well think of that udo showed what he thought of it by waving it peevishly this is not a time for tact he said tell me what i look like coronel considered for a moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8486,83-11691-0013,really frankly he asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8487,83-11691-0014,said udo nervously then frankly your royal highness looks funny very funny said udo wistfully very funny said coronel his highness sighed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8488,83-11691-0015,i was afraid so he said that's the cruel part about it had i been a lion there would have been a certain pathetic splendour about my position isolated cut off suffering in regal silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8489,83-11691-0016,he waved an explanatory paw even in the most hideous of beasts there might be a dignity he meditated for a moment have you ever seen a yak coronel he asked never,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8490,83-11691-0017,i saw one once in barodia it is not a beautiful animal coronel but as a yak i should not have been entirely unlovable one does not laugh at a yak coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8491,83-11691-0018,and where one does not laugh one may come to love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8492,83-11691-0019,striking i haven't seen it you see to one who didn't know your royal highness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8493,83-11691-0020,rabbit he sobbed so undignified,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8494,83-11691-0021,he added bitterly how did it happen i don't know coronel i just went to sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8495,83-11691-0022,he sat up suddenly and stared at coronel it was that old woman did it you mark my words coronel she did it why should she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8496,83-11691-0023,i was very polite to her don't you remember my saying to you be polite to her because she's probably a fairy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8497,83-11691-0024,so they held a council of war prince udo put forward two suggestions the first was that coronel should go back on the morrow and kill the old woman the second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8498,83-11691-0025,was that coronel should go back that afternoon and kill the old woman coronel pointed out that as she had turned prince udo into into a a quite so said udo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8499,83-11691-0026,it was likely that she alone could turn him back again and that in that case he had better only threaten her i want somebody killed said udo rather naturally suppose said coronel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8500,83-11691-0027,and make her tell me what she knows she knows something i'm certain then we shall see better what to do udo mused for a space why didn't they turn you into anything he asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8501,83-11691-0028,really i don't know perhaps because i'm too unimportant yes that must be it he began to feel a little brighter obviously that's it he caressed a whisker with one of his paws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8502,83-11691-0029,they were afraid of me he began to look so much happier that coronel thought it was a favourable moment in which to withdraw shall i go now your royal highness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8503,83-11691-0030,he murmured to himself obviously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8504,83-11691-0031,good bye your royal highness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8505,83-11691-0032,coronel got on his horse and rode away as soon as he was out of earshot he began to laugh spasm after spasm shook him no sooner had he composed himself to gravity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8506,83-11691-0033,than a remembrance of udo's appearance started him off again i couldn't have stayed with him a moment longer he thought i should have burst,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8507,83-11691-0034,however we'll soon get him all right that evening he reached the place where the cottage had stood but it was gone next morning he rode back to the wood udo was gone too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8508,83-11691-0035,he returned to the palace and began to think it out left to himself udo very soon made up his mind there were three courses open to him he might stay where he was till he was restored to health,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8509,83-11691-0036,this he rejected at once when you have the head of a rabbit the tail of a lion and the middle of a woolly lamb the need for action of some kind is imperative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8510,83-11691-0037,he might go back to araby,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8511,83-11691-0038,so popular to araby where he rode daily among his father's subjects that they might have the pleasure of cheering him how awkward for everybody on to euralia then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8512,83-11691-0039,why not the princess hyacinth had called for him what devotion it showed if he came to her even now in his present state of bad health she was in trouble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8513,83-11691-0040,already then he had suffered in her service so at least he would say and so possibly it might be coronel had thought him funny but women had not much sense of humour as a rule,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8514,83-11691-0041,she would find him strokable and the lion in him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8515,83-11691-0042,she would find that inspiring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8516,83-11691-0043,untamable in the man they love well there it was it was not as if he had coronel with him coronel and he in his present health could never have gone into euralia together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8517,83-11691-0044,the contrast was too striking but he alone hyacinth's only help surely she would appreciate his magnanimity also as he had told himself a moment ago,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8518,83-11691-0045,but no doubt he would think of some tremendously cunning device later on to euralia then with all dispatch he trotted off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8519,2159-179157-0000,and it is true that a person can deliberately hypnotize himself when he wishes to till he has become accustomed to it and is expert in it so to speak it does away at a stroke with the claims of all professional hypnotists and magnetic healers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8520,2159-179157-0001,that they have any peculiar power in themselves which they exert over their fellows one of these professionals gives an account in his book of what he calls the wonderful lock method he says that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8521,2159-179157-0002,though he is locked up in a separate room he can make the psychic power work through the walls all that he does is to put his subjects in the way of hypnotizing themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8522,2159-179157-0003,he shows his inconsistency when he states that under certain circumstances the hypnotizer is in danger of becoming hypnotized himself in this he makes no claim that the subject is using any psychic power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8523,2159-179157-0004,but of course if the hypnotizer looks steadily into the eyes of his subject and the subject looks into his eyes the steady gaze on a bright object will produce hypnotism in one quite as readily as in the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8524,2159-179157-0005,hypnotism is an established scientific fact but the claim that the hypnotizer has any mysterious psychic power is the invariable mark of the charlatan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8525,2159-179157-0006,probably no scientific phenomenon was ever so grossly prostituted to base ends as that of hypnotism later we shall see some of the outrageous forms this charlatanism assumes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8526,2159-179157-0007,and how it extends to the professional subjects as well as to the professional operators till those subjects even impose upon scientific men who ought to be proof against such deception,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8527,2159-179157-0008,moreover the possibility of self hypnotization carefully concealed and called by another name opens another great field of humbug and charlatanism of which the advertising columns of the newspapers are constantly filled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8528,2159-179157-0009,namely that of the clairvoyant and medium we may conceive how such a profession might become perfectly legitimate and highly useful but at present it seems as if any person who went into it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8529,2159-179157-0010,however honest he might be at the start soon began to deceive himself as well as others until he lost his power entirely to distinguish between fact and imagination before discussing the matter further,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8530,2159-179157-0011,let us quote doctor cocke's experiment in hypnotizing himself it will be remembered that a professional hypnotizer or magnetizer had hypnotized him by telling him to fix his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8531,2159-179157-0012,i was intensely cold my heart seemed to stand still i had ringing in my ears my hair seemed to rise upon my scalp i persisted in the effort and the previously mentioned noise in my ears grew louder and louder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8532,2159-179157-0013,the roar became deafening it crackled like a mighty fire i was fearfully conscious of myself having read vivid accounts of dreams visions et cetera it occurred to me that i would experience them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8533,2159-179157-0014,i felt in a vague way that there were beings all about me but could not hear their voices i felt as though every muscle in my body was fixed and rigid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8534,2159-179157-0015,the roar in my ears grew louder still and i heard above the roar reports which sounded like artillery and musketry then above the din of the noise a musical chord i seemed to be absorbed in this chord i knew nothing else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8535,2159-179157-0016,secondly i wished to be hypnotized these together with a vivid imagination and strained attention brought on the states which occurred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8536,2159-179157-0017,his descriptions of dreams bear a wonderful likeness to de quincey's dreams such as those described in the english mail coach de profundis and the confessions of an english opium eater,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8537,2159-179157-0018,all of which were presumably due to opium the causes which doctor cocke thinks produced the hypnotic condition in his case namely belief desire to be hypnotized and strained attention united with a vivid imagination,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8538,2159-179157-0019,are causes which are often found in conjunction and produce effects which we may reasonably explain on the theory of self hypnotization,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8539,2159-179157-0020,for instance the effects of an exciting religious revival are very like those produced by mesmer's operations in paris the subjects become hysterical and are ready to believe anything or do anything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8540,2159-179157-0021,by prolonging the operation a whole community becomes more or less hypnotized in all such cases however unusual excitement is commonly followed by unusual lethargy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8541,2159-179157-0022,in fact it is a sort of intoxication the same phenomena are probably accountable for many of the strange records of history the wonderful cures at lourdes of which we have read in zola's novel of that name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8542,2159-179157-0023,are no doubt the effect of hypnotization by the priests some of the strange movements of whole communities during the crusades are to be explained either on the theory of hypnotization or of contagion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8543,2159-179157-0024,and possibly these two things will turn out to be much the same in fact on no other ground can we explain the so called children's crusade in which over thirty thousand children from germany from all classes of the community,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8544,2159-179157-0025,tried to cross the alps in winter and in their struggles were all lost or sold into slavery without even reaching the holy land again hypnotism is accountable for many of the poet's dreams,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8545,2159-179157-0026,gazing steadily at a bed of bright coals or a stream of running water will invariably throw a sensitive subject into a hypnotic sleep that will last sometimes for several hours doctor cocke says,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8546,2159-179157-0027,that he has experimented in this direction with patients of his says he they have the ability to resist the state or to bring it at will many of them describe beautiful scenes from nature or some mighty cathedral,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8547,2159-179157-0028,with its lofty dome or the faces of imaginary beings beautiful or demoniacal according to the will and temper of the subject perhaps the most wonderful example of self hypnotism which we have in history,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8548,2159-179157-0029,is that of the mystic swedenborg who saw such strange things in his visions and at last came to believe in them as real the same explanation may be given of the manifestations of oriental prophets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8549,2159-179157-0030,for in the orient hypnotism is much easier and more systematically developed than with us of the west the performances of the dervishes and also of the fakirs who wound themselves and perform many wonderful feats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8550,2159-179157-0031,their impersonations are ridiculous in the extreme one man i remember believed himself to be controlled by the spirit of charles sumner being uneducated he used the most wretched english,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8551,2159-179157-0032,and his language was utterly devoid of sense while on the other hand a very intelligent lady who believed herself to be controlled by the spirit of charlotte cushman personated the part very well doctor cooke says of himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8552,2159-179157-0033,i can hypnotize myself to such an extent that i will become wholly unconscious of events taking place around me and a long interval of time say from one half to two hours will be a complete blank,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8553,2159-179154-0000,courting a broomstick the side show let us now describe some of the manifestations of hypnotism to see just how it operates and how it exhibits itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8554,2159-179154-0001,the following is a description of a public performance given by doctor herbert l flint a very successful public operator it is in the language of an eye witness a new york lawyer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8555,2159-179154-0002,in response to a call for volunteers twenty young and middle aged men came upon the stage they evidently belonged to the great middle class the entertainment commenced by doctor flint passing around the group,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8556,2159-179154-0003,who were seated on the stage in a semicircle facing the audience and stroking each one's head and forehead repeating the phrases close your eyes think of nothing but sleep you are very tired you are drowsy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8557,2159-179154-0004,you feel very sleepy as he did this several of the volunteers closed their eyes at once and one fell asleep immediately one or two remained awake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8558,2159-179154-0005,while a few were wide awake and smiling at the rest these latter were dismissed as unlikely subjects when the stage had been cleared of all those who were not responsive the doctor passed around and snapping his finger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8559,2159-179154-0006,at each individual awoke him one of the subjects when questioned afterward as to what sensation he experienced at the snapping of the fingers replied that it seemed to him as if something inside of his head responded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8560,2159-179154-0007,and with this sensation he regained self consciousness this is to be doubted as a rule subjects in this stage of hypnotism do not feel any sensation that they can remember,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8561,2159-179154-0008,that you can't pull them apart they are fast you cannot pull them apart try you can't the whole class made frantic efforts to unclasp their hands but were unable to do so the doctor's explanation of this is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8562,2159-179154-0009,that what they were really doing was to force their hands closer together thus obeying the counter suggestion that they thought they were trying to unclasp their hands was evident from their endeavors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8563,2159-179154-0010,one young fellow aged about eighteen said that he was addicted to the cigarette habit the suggestion was made to him that he would not be able to smoke a cigarette for twenty four hours after the entertainment he was asked to smoke as was his usual habit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8564,2159-179154-0011,he was then away from any one who could influence him he replied that the very idea was repugnant however he was induced to take a cigarette in his mouth but it made him ill and he flung it away with every expression of disgust,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8565,2159-179154-0012,this is an instance of what is called post hypnotic suggestion doctor cocke tells of suggesting to a drinker whom he was trying to cure of the habit that for the next three days anything he took would make him vomit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8566,2159-179154-0013,they immediately began and twirled them faster and faster in spite of their efforts to stop one of the subjects said he thought of nothing but the strange action of his hands and sometimes it puzzled him to know why they whirled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8567,2159-179154-0014,at this point doctor flint's daughter took charge of the class she pointed her finger at one of them and the subject began to look steadily before him at which the rest of the class were highly amused,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8568,2159-179154-0015,presently the subject's head leaned forward the pupils of his eyes dilated and assumed a peculiar glassy stare he arose with a steady gliding gait,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8569,2159-179154-0016,then he stopped miss flint led him to the front of the stage and left him standing in profound slumber he stood there stooping eyes set and vacant fast asleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8570,2159-179154-0017,in the meantime the act had caused great laughter among the rest of the class one young fellow in particular laughed so uproariously that tears coursed down his cheeks and he took out his handkerchief to wipe his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8571,2159-179154-0018,just as he was returning it to his pocket the lady suddenly pointed a finger at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8572,2159-179154-0019,but the moment the gesture was made his countenance fell his mirth stopped while that of his companions redoubled and the change was so obvious that the audience shared in the laughter but the subject neither saw nor heard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8573,2159-179154-0020,his eyes assumed the same expression that had been noticed in his companion's he too arose in the same attitude as if his head were pulling the body along and following the finger in the same way as his predecessor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8574,2159-179154-0021,another was given a broomstick and told to hunt game in the woods before him another was given a large rag doll and told that it was an infant and that he must look among the audience and discover the father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8575,2159-179154-0022,he was informed that he could tell who the father was by the similarity and the color of the eyes these suggestions were made in a loud tone miss flint being no nearer one subject than another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8576,2159-179154-0023,the bare suggestion was given as now think that you are a newsboy and are selling papers or now think that you are hunting and are going into the woods to shoot birds so the party was started,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8577,2159-179154-0024,at the same time into the audience the one who was impersonating a newsboy went about crying his edition in a loud voice while the hunter crawled along stealthily and carefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8578,2159-179154-0025,the newsboy even adopted the well worn device of asking those whom he solicited to buy to help him get rid of his stock one man offered him a cent when the price was two cents the newsboy chaffed the would be purchaser,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8579,2159-179154-0026,and taking him into the center of the stage showed him a small riding whip he looked at it indifferently enough he was told it was a hot bar of iron but he shook his head still incredulous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8580,2159-179154-0027,the suggestion was repeated and as the glazed look came into his eyes the incredulous look died out every member of the class was following the suggestion made to the subject in hand all of them had the same expression in their eyes the doctor said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8581,2159-179154-0028,that his daughter was hypnotizing the whole class through this one individual as she spoke she lightly touched the subject with the end of the whip the moment the subject felt the whip he jumped and shrieked as if it really were a hot iron,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8582,2159-179154-0029,she touched each one of the class in succession and every one manifested the utmost pain and fear one subject sat down on the floor and cried in dire distress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8583,2159-179154-0030,had the suggestion been continued it would undoubtedly have raised a blister one of the amusing experiments tried at a later time was that of a tall young man diffident pale and modest being given a broom carefully wrapped in a sheet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8584,2159-179154-0031,and told that it was his sweetheart he accepted the situation and sat down by the broom he was a little sheepish at first but eventually he grew bolder and smiled upon her such a smile as malvolio casts upon olivia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8585,2159-179154-0032,the manner in which little by little he ventured upon a familiar footing was exceedingly funny but when in a moment of confident response to his wooing he clasped her round the waist and imprinted a chaste kiss upon the brushy part of the broom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8586,2159-179154-0033,disguised by the sheet the house resounded with roars of laughter the subject however was deaf to all of the noise he was absorbed in his courtship and he continued to hug the broom and exhibit in his features,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8587,2159-179154-0034,all the world loves a lover as the saying is and all the world loves to laugh at him one of the subjects was told that the head of a man in the audience was on fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8588,2159-179154-0035,he looked for a moment and then dashed down the platform into the audience and seizing the man's head vigorously rubbed it as this did not extinguish the flames he took off his coat and put the fire out in doing this he set his coat on fire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8589,2159-179154-0036,then he calmly resumed his garment and walked back to the stage the side show closed the evening's entertainment a young man was told to think of himself as managing a side show at a circus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8590,2159-179154-0037,when his mind had absorbed this idea he was ordered to open his exhibition he at once mounted a table and in the voice of the traditional side show fakir began to dilate upon the fat woman and the snakes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8591,2159-179154-0038,that for the small sum of ten cents they could see more wonders than ever before had been crowded under one canvas tent he harangued the crowd as they surged about the tent door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8592,2159-179154-0039,he pointed to a suppositious canvas picture he chaffed the boys he flattered the vanity of the young fellows with their girls telling them that they could not afford for the small sum of ten cents to miss this great show,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8593,2159-179156-0000,how the subject feels under hypnotization doctor cooper's experience effect of music doctor alfred marthieu's experiments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8594,2159-179156-0001,the sensations produced during a state of hypnosis are very interesting as may be supposed they differ greatly in different persons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8595,2159-179156-0002,one of the most interesting accounts ever given is that of doctor james r cocke a hypnotist himself who submitted to being operated upon by a professional magnetizer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8596,2159-179156-0003,he was at that time a firm believer in the theory of personal magnetism a delusion from which he afterward escaped on the occasion which he describes the operator commanded him to close his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8597,2159-179156-0004,but he did open them at once again he told him to close the eyes and at the same time he gently stroked his head and face and eyelids with his hand doctor cocke fancied he felt a tingling sensation in his forehead and eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8598,2159-179156-0005,which he supposed came from the hand of the operator afterward he came to believe that this sensation was purely imaginary on his part then he says a sensation akin to fear came over me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8599,2159-179156-0006,the operator said you are going to sleep you are getting sleepy you cannot open your eyes i was conscious that my heart was beating rapidly and i felt a sensation of terror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8600,2159-179156-0007,he then made passes over my head down over my hands and body but did not touch me he then said to me you cannot open your eyes the motor apparatus of my lids would not seemingly respond to my will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8601,2159-179156-0008,yet i was conscious that while one part of my mind wanted to open my eyes another part did not want to so i was in a paradoxical state i believed that i could open my eyes and yet could not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8602,2159-179156-0009,the feeling of not wishing to open my eyes was not based upon any desire to please the operator i had no personal interest in him in any way but be it understood i firmly believed in his power to control me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8603,2159-179156-0010,then he stroked the arm and said it was growing numb he said you have no feeling in it have you doctor cocke goes on i said no and i knew that i said no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8604,2159-179156-0011,the operator went on pricking the arm with a pin and though doctor cocke felt the pain he said he did not feel it and at the same time the sensation of terror increased i was not conscious of my body at all he says further on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8605,2159-179156-0012,but i was painfully conscious of the two contradictory elements within me i knew that my body existed but could not prove it to myself i knew that the statements made by the operator were in a measure untrue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8606,2159-179156-0013,i obeyed them voluntarily and involuntarily this is the last remembrance that i have of that hypnotic experience after this however the operator caused the doctor to do a number of things which he learned of from his friends after the performance was over,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8607,2159-179156-0014,it seemed to me that the hypnotist commanded me to awake as soon as i dropped my arm and yet ten minutes of unconsciousness had passed on a subsequent occasion doctor cocke who was blind was put into a deep hypnotic sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8608,2159-179156-0015,by fixing his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand this time he experienced a still greater degree of terror and incidentally learned that he could hypnotize himself the matter of self hypnotism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8609,2159-179156-0016,we shall consider in another chapter in this connection we find great interest in an article in the medical news july twenty eighth eighteen ninety four,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8610,2159-179156-0017,in which he describes the effects of music upon hypnotic subjects while in vienna he took occasion to observe closely the enthusiastic musical devotees as they sat in the audience at the performance of one of wagner's operas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8611,2159-179156-0018,he believed they were in a condition of self induced hypnotism in which their subjective faculties were so exalted as to supersede their objective perceptions music was no longer to them a succession of pleasing sounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8612,2159-179156-0019,but the embodiment of a drama in which they became so wrapped up that they forgot all about the mechanical and external features of the music and lived completely in a fairy world of dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8613,2159-179156-0020,this observation suggested to him an interesting series of experiments his first subject was easily hypnotized and of an emotional nature wagner's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8614,2159-179156-0021,was played from the piano score the pulse of the subject became more rapid and at first of higher tension increasing from a normal rate of sixty beats a minute to one hundred twenty then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8615,2159-179156-0022,as the music progressed the tension diminished the respiration increased from eighteen to thirty per minute great excitement in the subject was evident his whole body was thrown into motion his legs were drawn up his arms tossed into the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8616,2159-179156-0023,the state of mind brought up before him in the most realistic and vivid manner possible the picture of the ride of tam o'shanter which he had seen years before the picture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8617,2159-179156-0024,soon became real to him and he found himself taking part in a wild chase not as witch devil or tam even but in some way his consciousness was spread through every part of the scene being of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8618,2159-179156-0025,and yet playing the part of spectator as is often the case in dreams doctor warthin tried the same experiment again this time on a young man who was not so emotional and was hypnotized with much more difficulty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8619,2159-179156-0026,this subject did not pass into such a deep state of hypnotism but the result was practically the same the pulse rate rose from seventy to one hundred twenty the sensation remembered was that of riding furiously through the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8620,2159-179156-0027,the experiment was repeated on other subjects in all cases with the same result,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8621,2159-179156-0028,to him it always expressed the pictured wild ride of the daughters of wotan the subject taking part in the ride it was noticeable in each case that the same music played to them in the waking state produced no special impression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8622,2159-179156-0029,at first it seemed to produce the opposite effect for the pulse was lowered later it rose to a rate double the normal and the tension was diminished the impression described by the subject afterward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8623,2159-179156-0030,and the subject seemed to contemplate a landscape of lofty grandeur a different sort of music was played,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8625,2159-179156-0032,it became slow and irregular and very small the respiration decreased almost to gasping the face grew pale and a cold perspiration broke out readers who are especially interested in this subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8626,2159-179156-0033,will find descriptions of many other interesting experiments in the same article doctor cocke describes a peculiar trick he played upon the sight of a subject says he i once hypnotized a man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8627,2159-179156-0034,and call the letters as i directed stimulation was in this case impossible as i made him read fifteen or twenty pages he calling the letters as suggested each time they occurred the extraordinary heightening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8628,2159-179156-0035,and clairvoyance if the powers of the mind are so enormously increased all that is required of a very sensitive and easily hypnotized person is to hypnotize him or herself when he will be able to read thoughts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8629,5867-48852-0000,bell had declared that her sister would be very happy to see john eames if he would go over to allington and he had replied that of course he would go there so much having been as it were settled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8630,5867-48852-0001,he was able to speak of his visit as a matter of course at the breakfast table on the morning after the earl's dinner party i must get you to come round with me dale and see what i am doing to the land the earl said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8631,5867-48852-0002,but the squire preferred walking and in this way they were disposed of soon after breakfast john had it in his mind to get bell to himself for half an hour and hold a conference with her but it either happened that lady julia was too keen in her duties as a hostess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8632,5867-48852-0003,or else as was more possible bell avoided the meeting no opportunity for such an interview offered itself though he hung about the drawing room all the morning you had better wait for luncheon now lady julia said to him about twelve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8633,5867-48852-0004,but this he declined and taking himself away hid himself about the place for the next hour and a half during this time he considered much whether it would be better for him to ride or walk if she should give him any hope,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8634,5867-48852-0005,he could ride back triumphant as a field marshal then the horse would be delightful to him but if she should give him no hope if it should be his destiny to be rejected utterly on that morning then the horse would be terribly in the way of his sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8635,5867-48852-0006,resting when he might choose to rest and running when it might suit him to run and she is not like other girls he thought to himself she won't care for my boots being dirty so at last he elected to walk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8636,5867-48852-0007,stand up to her boldly man the earl had said to him by george what is there to be afraid of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8637,5867-48852-0008,there's nothing sets em against a man like being sheepish how the earl knew so much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8638,5867-48852-0009,i am not prepared to say but eames took his advice as being in itself good and resolved to act upon it not that any resolution will be of any use he said to himself as he walked along,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8639,5867-48852-0010,when the moment comes i know that i shall tremble before her and i know that she'll see it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8640,5867-48852-0011,he had last seen her on the lawn behind the small house just at that time when her passion for crosbie was at the strongest eames had gone thither impelled by a foolish desire to declare to her his hopeless love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8641,5867-48852-0012,and she had answered him by telling him that she loved mister crosbie better than all the world besides of course she had done so at that time but nevertheless her manner of telling him had seemed to him to be cruel and he also had been cruel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8642,5867-48852-0013,he had told her that he hated crosbie calling him that man and assuring her that no earthly consideration should induce him to go into that man's house then he had walked away moodily wishing him all manner of evil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8643,5867-48852-0014,was it not singular that all the evil things which he in his mind had meditated for the man had fallen upon him crosbie had lost his love he had so proved himself to be a villain that his name might not be so much as mentioned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8644,5867-48852-0015,he had been ignominiously thrashed but what good would all this be if his image were still dear to lily's heart i told her that i loved her then he said to himself though i had no right to do so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8645,5867-48852-0016,at any rate i have a right to tell her now when he reached allington he did not go in through the village and up to the front of the small house by the cross street but turned by the church gate and passed over the squire's terrace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8646,5867-48852-0017,here he encountered hopkins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8647,5867-48852-0018,mister john may i make so bold and hopkins held out a very dirty hand which eames of course took unconscious of the cause of this new affection i'm just going to call at the small house and i thought i'd come this way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8648,5867-48852-0019,to be sure this way or that way or any way who's so welcome mister john i envies you i envies you more than i envies any man if i could a got him by the scuff of the neck i'd a treated him jist like any wermin i would indeed he was wermin i,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8649,5867-48852-0020,ollays said it i hated him ollays i did indeed mister john,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8650,5867-48852-0021,he never looked at one as though one were a christian did he mister john,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8651,5867-48852-0022,only she poor young lady she'll be better now mister john a deal better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8652,5867-48852-0023,tell me mister john did you give it him well when you got him i heard you did two black eyes and all his face one mash of gore and hopkins who was by no means a young man stiffly put himself into a fighting attitude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8653,5867-48852-0024,eames passed on over the little bridge which seemed to be in a state of fast decay unattended to by any friendly carpenter now that the days of its use were so nearly at an end and on into the garden lingering on the spot where he had last said farewell to lily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8654,5867-48852-0025,but there was no one to be seen in the garden and no sound to be heard as every step brought him nearer to her whom he was seeking he became more and more conscious of the hopelessness of his errand him she had never loved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8655,5867-48852-0026,and why should he venture to hope that she would love him now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8656,5867-48852-0027,had he not been aware that his promise to others required that he should persevere he had said that he would do this thing and he would be as good as his word but he hardly ventured to hope that he might be successful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8657,5867-48852-0028,in this frame of mind he slowly made his way up across the lawn my dear there is john eames said missus dale who had first seen him from the parlour window don't go mamma,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8658,5867-48852-0029,i don't know perhaps it will be better that i should no mamma no what good can it do it can do no good i like him as well as i can like any one i love him dearly but it can do no good let him come in here and be very kind to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8659,5867-48852-0030,and i shall be very glad to see him then missus dale went round to the other room and admitted her visitor through the window of the drawing room we are in terrible confusion john are we not and so you are really going to live in guestwick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8660,5867-48852-0031,well it looks like it does it not but to tell you a secret only it must be a secret you must not mention it at guestwick manor even bell does not know we have half made up our minds to unpack all our things and stay where we are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8661,5867-48852-0032,eames was so intent on his own purpose and so fully occupied with the difficulty of the task before him that he could hardly receive missus dale's tidings with all the interest which they deserved unpack them all again he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8662,5867-48852-0033,that will be very troublesome is lily with you missus dale yes she is in the parlour come and see her so he followed missus dale through the hall and found himself in the presence of his love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8663,5867-48852-0034,how do you do john how do you do lily we all know the way in which such meetings are commenced each longed to be tender and affectionate to the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8664,5867-48852-0035,but neither knew how to throw any tenderness into this first greeting so you're staying at the manor house said lily yes i'm staying there your uncle and bell came yesterday afternoon have you heard about bell said missus dale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8665,5867-48852-0036,oh yes mary told me i'm so glad of it i always liked doctor crofts very much i have not congratulated her because i didn't know whether it was a secret but crofts was there last night and if it is a secret he didn't seem to be very careful about keeping it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8666,5867-48852-0037,i don't know that i am fond of such secrets but as she said this she thought of crosbie's engagement which had been told to every one and of its consequences is it to be soon he asked well yes we think so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8667,5867-48852-0038,of course nothing is settled it was such fun said lily james who took at any rate a year or two to make his proposal wanted to be married the next day afterwards no lily not quite that well mamma it was very nearly that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8668,5867-48852-0039,i don't know anybody i should so much like for a brother i'm very glad you like him very glad i hope you'll be friends always there was some little tenderness in this as john acknowledged to himself i'm sure we shall if he likes it that is if i ever happen to see him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8669,5867-48852-0040,i'll do anything for him i can if he ever comes up to london wouldn't it be a good thing missus dale if he settled himself in london no john it would be a very bad thing why should he wish to rob me of my daughter missus dale was speaking of her eldest daughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8670,5867-48852-0041,but the very allusion to any such robbery covered john eames's face with a blush,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8671,5867-48852-0042,and for the moment silenced him you think he would have a better career in london said lily speaking under the influence of her superior presence of mind she had certainly shown defective judgment in desiring her mother not to leave them alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8672,5867-48852-0043,and of this missus dale soon felt herself aware the thing had to be done and no little precautionary measure such as this of missus dale's enforced presence would prevent it of this missus dale was well aware,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8673,5867-48852-0044,and she felt moreover that john was entitled to an opportunity of pleading his own cause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8674,5867-48852-0045,but not the less should he have it of right seeing that he desired it but yet missus dale did not dare to get up and leave the room lily had asked her not to do so and at the present period of their lives all lily's requests were sacred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8675,5867-48852-0046,they continued for some time to talk of crofts and his marriage and when that subject was finished they discussed their own probable or as it seemed now improbable removal to guestwick it's going too far mamma said lily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8676,5867-48852-0047,to say that you think we shall not go it was only last night that you suggested it the truth is john that hopkins came in and discoursed with the most wonderful eloquence nobody dared to oppose hopkins he made us almost cry he was so pathetic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8677,5867-48852-0048,he has just been talking to me too said john as i came through the squire's garden and what has he been saying to you said missus dale oh i don't know not much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8678,5867-48852-0049,john however remembered well at this moment all that the gardener had said to him did she know of that encounter between him and crosbie and if she did know of it in what light did she regard it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8679,5867-48852-0050,he had sworn to himself that he would not leave the small house without asking lily to be his wife it seemed to him as though he would be guilty of falsehood towards the earl if he did so lord de guest had opened his house to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8680,5867-48852-0051,and had asked all the dales there and had offered himself up as a sacrifice at the cruel shrine of a serious dinner party to say nothing of that easier and lighter sacrifice which he had made in a pecuniary point of view in order that this thing might be done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8681,5867-48852-0052,under such circumstances eames was too honest a man not to do it let the difficulties in his way be what they might he had sat there for an hour and missus dale still remained with her daughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8682,5867-48852-0053,should he get up boldly and ask lily to put on her bonnet and come out into the garden as the thought struck him he rose and grasped at his hat i am going to walk back to guestwick said he it was very good of you to come so far to see us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8683,5867-48852-0054,i was always fond of walking he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8684,5867-48852-0055,have a glass of wine before you go oh dear no i think i'll go back through the squire's fields and out on the road at the white gate the path is quite dry now i dare say it is said missus dale lily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8685,5867-48852-0056,i wonder whether you would come as far as that with me as the request was made missus dale looked at her daughter almost beseechingly do pray do said he it is a beautiful day for walking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8686,5867-48852-0057,the path proposed lay right across the field into which lily had taken crosbie when she made her offer to let him off from his engagement could it be possible that she should ever walk there again with another lover no john she said not to day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8687,5867-48852-0058,i think i am almost tired and i had rather not go out it would do you good said missus dale i don't want to be done good to mamma besides i should have to come back by myself i'll come back with you said johnny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8688,5867-48852-0059,oh yes and then i should have to go again with you but john really i don't wish to walk to day whereupon john eames again put down his hat lily said he and then he stopped missus dale walked away to the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8689,5867-48852-0060,lily i have come over here on purpose to speak to you indeed i have come down from london only that i might see you have you john yes i have you know well all that i have got to tell you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8690,5867-48852-0061,no john no she answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8691,5867-48852-0062,always no to that how can it be otherwise you would not have me marry you while i love another but he is gone he has taken another wife i cannot change myself because he is changed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8692,5867-48852-0063,if you are kind to me you will let that be enough but you are so unkind to me no no oh i would wish to be so kind to you john here take my hand it is the hand of a friend who loves you and will always love you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8693,5867-48852-0064,dear john i will do anything everything for you but that there is only one thing said he still holding her by the hand but with his face turned from her nay do not say so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8694,5867-48852-0065,i could not have that one thing and i was nearer to my heart's longings than you have ever been i cannot have that one thing but i know that there are other things and i will not allow myself to be broken hearted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8695,5867-48852-0066,you are stronger than i am he said not stronger but more certain make yourself as sure as i am and you too will be strong is it not so mamma,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8696,5867-48852-0067,i wish it could be otherwise i wish it could be otherwise if you can give him any hope mamma tell me that i may come again in a year he pleaded i cannot tell you so you may not come again not in this way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8697,5867-48852-0068,that i loved him better than all the world besides it is still the same i still love him better than all the world how then can i give you any hope,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8698,5867-48852-0069,but it will not be so for ever lily for ever why should he not be mine as well as hers when that for ever comes john if you understand what it is to love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8699,5867-48852-0070,you will say nothing more of it i have spoken to you more openly about this than i have ever done to anybody even to mamma because i have wished to make you understand my feelings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8700,5867-48852-0071,i should be disgraced in my own eyes if i admitted the love of another man after after it is to me almost as though i had married him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8701,5867-48852-0072,i am not blaming him remember these things are different with a man she had not dropped his hand and as she made her last speech was sitting in her old chair with her eyes fixed upon the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8702,5867-48852-0073,she spoke in a low voice slowly almost with difficulty but still the words came very clearly with a clear distinct voice which caused them to be remembered with accuracy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8703,5867-48852-0074,to him it seemed to be impossible that he should continue his suit after such a declaration to missus dale they were terrible words speaking of a perpetual widowhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8704,5867-48852-0075,and telling of an amount of suffering greater even than that which she had anticipated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8705,5867-48852-0076,or had attempted to make so clear an exposition of her own feelings i should be disgraced in my own eyes if i admitted the love of another man they were terrible words but very easy to be understood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8706,5867-48852-0077,missus dale had felt from the first that eames was coming too soon that the earl and the squire together were making an effort to cure the wound too quickly after its infliction that time should have been given to her girl to recover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8707,5867-48852-0078,but now the attempt had been made and words had been forced from lily's lips the speaking of which would never be forgotten by herself i knew that it would be so said john ah yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8708,5867-48852-0079,you know it because your heart understands my heart and you will not be angry with me and say naughty cruel words as you did once before we will think of each other john and pray for each other and will always love one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8709,5867-48852-0080,when we do meet let us be glad to see each other no other friend shall ever be dearer to me than you are you are so true and honest when you marry i will tell your wife what an infinite blessing god has given her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8710,5867-48852-0081,you shall never do that yes i will i understand what you mean but yet i will good by missus dale he said good by john,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8711,5867-48852-0082,and i will love you now then she put up her lips and kissed his face and so will i love you said lily giving him her hand again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8712,5867-48852-0083,he looked longingly into her face as though he had thought it possible that she also might kiss him then he pressed her hand to his lips and without speaking any further farewell took up his hat and left the room poor fellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8713,5867-48852-0084,said missus dale they should not have let him come said lily but they don't understand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8714,5867-48852-0085,and they mean to be good natured and to give me another very shortly after that lily went away by herself and sat alone for hours and when she joined her mother again at tea time nothing further was said of john eames's visit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8715,5867-48852-0086,he made his way out by the front door and through the churchyard and in this way on to the field through which he had asked lily to walk with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8716,5867-48852-0087,as he made his way through the tombstones he paused and read one as though it interested him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8717,5867-48852-0088,and then pulled out his own watch as though to verify the one by the other he made unconsciously a struggle to drive away from his thoughts the facts of the late scene and for some five or ten minutes he succeeded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8718,5867-48852-0089,and laughed inwardly as he remembered the figure of rafferty bringing in the knight's shoes he had gone some half mile upon his way before he ventured to stand still and tell himself that he had failed in the great object of his life yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8719,5867-48852-0090,he had failed and he acknowledged to himself with bitter reproaches that he had failed now and for ever he told himself that he had obtruded upon her in her sorrow with an unmannerly love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8720,5867-48852-0091,and rebuked himself as having been not only foolish but ungenerous his friend the earl had been wont in his waggish way to call him the conquering hero and had so talked him out of his common sense as to have made him almost think that he would be successful in his suit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8721,5867-48852-0092,he almost hated the earl for having brought him to this condition a conquering hero indeed how should he manage to sneak back among them all at the manor house crestfallen and abject in his misery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8722,5867-48852-0093,everybody knew the errand on which he had gone and everybody must know of his failure how could he have been such a fool as to undertake such a task under the eyes of so many lookers on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8723,5867-48852-0094,was it not the case that he had so fondly expected success as to think only of his triumph in returning and not of his more probable disgrace he had allowed others to make a fool of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8724,5867-48852-0095,and had so made a fool of himself that now all hope and happiness were over for him how could he escape at once out of the country back to london how could he get away without saying a word further to any one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8725,5867-48852-0096,he crossed the road at the end of the squire's property where the parish of allington divides itself from that of abbot's guest in which the earl's house stands and made his way back along the copse which skirted the field in which they had encountered the bull,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8726,5867-48852-0097,ah yes it had been well for him that he had not come out on horseback that ride home along the high road and up to the manor house stables would under his present circumstances have been almost impossible to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8727,5867-48852-0098,as it was he did not think it possible that he should return to his place in the earl's house how could he pretend to maintain his ordinary demeanour under the eyes of those two old men it would be better for him to get home to his mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8728,5867-48852-0099,to send a message from thence to the manor and then to escape back to london so thinking but with no resolution made he went on through the woods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8729,5867-48852-0100,there he stopped and stood a while with his broad hand spread over the letters which he had cut in those early days so as to hide them from his sight what an ass i have been always and ever he said to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8730,5867-48852-0101,it was not only of his late disappointment that he was thinking but of his whole past life he was conscious of his hobbledehoyhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8731,5867-48852-0102,of that backwardness on his part in assuming manhood which had rendered him incapable of making himself acceptable to lily before she had fallen into the clutches of crosbie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8732,5867-48852-0103,if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating regardless whether he himself might be called upon to follow him was it not hard that for the two of them for lily and for him also,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8733,5867-48852-0104,there should be such punishment because of the insincerity of that man when he had thus stood upon the bridge for some quarter of an hour he took out his knife and with deep rough gashes in the wood cut out lily's name from the rail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8734,5867-48852-0105,he had hardly finished and was still looking at the chips as they were being carried away by the stream when a gentle step came close up to him and turning round he saw that lady julia was on the bridge she was close to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8735,5867-48852-0106,and had already seen his handiwork has she offended you john she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8736,5867-48852-0107,do you mean to cut it out from your heart never i would if i could but i never shall keep to it as to a great treasure it will be a joy to you in after years and not a sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8737,5867-48852-0108,will be a consolation when you are as old as i am it is something to have had a heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8738,5867-48852-0109,and john i can understand her feeling now and indeed i thought all through that you were asking her too soon but the time may yet come when she will think better of your wishes no no never i begin to know her now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8739,5867-48852-0110,if you can be constant in your love you may win her yet remember how young she is and how young you both are come again in two years time and then when you have won her you shall tell me that i have been a good old woman to you both,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8740,5867-48852-0111,i shall never win her lady julia as he spoke these last words the tears were running down his cheeks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8741,5867-48852-0112,it was well for him that she had come upon him in his sorrow when he once knew that she had seen his tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8742,1098-133695-0000,as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it but in fact the british public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer whose fortune had dropped her as her cousin said into the dullest house in england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8743,1098-133695-0001,her gouty uncle received very little company and missus touchett not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours was not warranted in expecting visits from them she had however a peculiar taste she liked to receive cards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8744,1098-133695-0002,for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard she flattered herself that she was a very just woman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8745,1098-133695-0003,and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing she had played no social part as mistress of gardencourt and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8746,1098-133695-0004,but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure really very gratuitous to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8747,1098-133695-0005,isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8748,1098-133695-0006,isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8749,1098-133695-0007,she was very critical herself it was incidental to her age her sex and her nationality but she was very sentimental as well and there was something in missus touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing now what's your point of view,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8750,1098-133695-0008,she asked of her aunt when you criticise everything here you should have a point of view yours doesn't seem to be american you thought everything over there so disagreeable when i criticise i have mine it's thoroughly american,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8751,1098-133695-0009,there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them you may say that doesn't make them very numerous american never in the world that's shockingly narrow my point of view thank god is personal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8752,1098-133695-0010,isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging but it would not have sounded well for her to say so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8753,1098-133695-0011,would savour of immodesty even of arrogance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8754,1098-133695-0012,with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance her cousin used as the phrase is to chaff her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8755,1098-133695-0013,he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8756,1098-133695-0014,of laughing at all things beginning with himself such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son this gentleman's weak lungs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8757,1098-133695-0015,his useless life his fantastic mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8758,1098-133695-0016,his adopted and his native country his charming new found cousin i keep a band of music in my ante room he said once to her it has orders to play without stopping it renders me two excellent services,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8759,1098-133695-0017,it keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8760,1098-133695-0018,the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8761,1098-133695-0019,and enter the private apartments it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order it was but half hospitality to let her remain outside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8762,1098-133695-0020,it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched he drew a caricature of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8763,1098-133695-0021,in the folds of the national banner isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so but she nevertheless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8764,1098-133695-0022,she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation she defended england against his mother but when ralph sang its praises on purpose as she said to work her up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8765,1098-133695-0023,she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points in fact the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8766,1098-133695-0024,and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8767,1098-133695-0025,if her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8768,1098-133695-0026,i don't know what's the matter with you she observed to him once but i suspect you're a great humbug that's your privilege ralph answered who had not been used to being so crudely addressed i don't know what you care for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8769,1098-133695-0027,i don't think you care for anything you don't really care for england when you praise it you don't care for america even when you pretend to abuse it i care for nothing but you dear cousin said ralph if i could believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8770,1098-133695-0028,even that i should be very glad ah well i should hope so the young man exclaimed isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth he thought a great deal about her she was constantly present to his mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8771,1098-133695-0029,at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate had refreshed and quickened them given them wings and something to fly for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8772,1098-133695-0030,poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy his outlook habitually sombre lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8773,1098-133695-0031,the old man had been gravely ill in the spring and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with just now he appeared disburdened of pain but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8774,1098-133695-0032,who was waiting to take him off his guard if the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him that his own name would be the first grimly called,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8775,1098-133695-0033,the father and son had been close companions and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8776,1098-133695-0034,at the prospect of losing his great motive ralph lost indeed his one inspiration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8777,1098-133695-0035,but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8778,1098-133695-0036,he bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that of the two the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8779,1098-133695-0037,which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first but of the two triumphs that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which with all abatements he enjoyed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8780,1098-133695-0038,he wondered whether he were harbouring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany but he judged that on the whole he was not after he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this and every day he felt a little more sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8781,1098-133695-0039,lord warburton had been right about her she was a really interesting little figure ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8782,1098-133695-0040,which he had always greatly admired if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order a character like that he said to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8783,1098-133695-0041,a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature it's finer than the finest work of art than a greek bas relief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8784,1098-133695-0042,than a gothic cathedral it's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it i had never been more blue more bored than for a week before she came i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8785,1098-133695-0043,a greek bas relief to stick over my chimney piece the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand and i'm told to walk in and admire my poor boy you've been sadly ungrateful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8786,1098-133695-0044,and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again the sentiment of these reflexions was very just,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8787,1098-133695-0045,his cousin was a very brilliant girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8788,1098-133695-0046,but she needed the knowing and his attitude with regard to her though it was contemplative and critical was not judicial he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8789,1098-133695-0047,isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own whenever she executes them said ralph may i be there to see it devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8790,1098-133695-0048,and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed he was not a great walker but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8791,1098-133695-0049,a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8792,1098-133695-0050,they took a boat on the river the dear little river as isabel called it where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape or drove over the country in a phaeton a low capacious thick wheeled phaeton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8793,1098-133695-0051,but which he had now ceased to enjoy isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8794,1098-133695-0052,full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find past cottages thatched and timbered past ale houses latticed and sanded past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8795,1098-133695-0053,between hedgerows made thick by midsummer when they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8796,1098-133695-0054,but the two for the most part sat silent the old man with his head back and his eyes closed his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8797,1098-133695-0055,one day however a visitor had arrived the two young persons after spending an hour on the river strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8798,1098-133695-0056,of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8799,1098-133695-0057,he had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked as the father and son often invited him to do for a dinner and a lodging isabel seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival had discovered in this brief space that she liked him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8800,1098-133695-0058,he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times she had hoped she should see him again hoped too that she should see a few others gardencourt was not dull,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8801,1098-133695-0059,the place itself was sovereign her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered her idea of cousins having tended to gloom then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8802,1098-133695-0060,her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8803,1098-133695-0061,had been that she should see a great many people when ralph said to her as he had done several times i wonder you find this endurable you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8804,1098-133695-0062,though you would never suppose it when he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8805,1098-133695-0063,little however for the present had come of his offers and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8806,1098-133695-0064,isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8807,1098-133695-0065,well now there's a specimen he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised lord warburton a specimen of what asked the girl a specimen of an english gentleman do you mean they're all like him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8808,1098-133695-0066,oh no they're not all like him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8809,1098-133695-0067,said isabel because i'm sure he's nice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8810,1098-133695-0068,the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well but i needn't ask that he said since you've been handling the oars i've been rowing a little isabel answered but how should you know it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8811,1098-133695-0069,oh i know he doesn't row he's too lazy said his lordship indicating ralph touchett with a laugh he has a good excuse for his laziness isabel rejoined lowering her voice a little ah he has a good excuse for everything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8812,1098-133695-0070,cried lord warburton still with his sonorous mirth my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well said ralph she does everything well she touches nothing that she doesn't adorn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8813,1098-133695-0071,it makes one want to be touched miss archer lord warburton declared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8814,1098-133695-0072,who if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8815,1098-133695-0073,had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof lord warburton not only spent the night at gardencourt but he was persuaded to remain over the second day and when the second day was ended,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8816,1098-133695-0074,he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow during this period he addressed many of his remarks to isabel who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace she found herself liking him extremely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8817,1098-133695-0075,the first impression he had made on her had had weight but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him though quite without luridity as a hero of romance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8818,1098-133695-0076,with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities it's very nice to know two such charming people as those she said meaning by those her cousin and her cousin's friend it must be added moreover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8819,1098-133695-0077,that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8820,1098-133695-0078,but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour and then rising observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good night isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8821,1098-133695-0079,the occasion wore to her sense a festive character and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early so without further thought she replied very simply need i go dear aunt i'll come up in half an hour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8822,1098-133695-0080,it's impossible i should wait for you missus touchett answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8823,1098-133695-0081,ralph will light my candle isabel gaily engaged i'll light your candle do let me light your candle miss archer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8824,1098-133695-0082,only i beg it shall not be before midnight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8825,1098-133695-0083,and transferred them coldly to her niece,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8826,1098-133695-0084,you're not you're not at your blest albany my dear isabel rose blushing i wish i were she said oh i say mother ralph broke out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8827,1098-133695-0085,i must take it as i find it can't i stay with my own cousin isabel enquired i'm not aware that lord warburton is your cousin perhaps i had better go to bed the visitor suggested that will arrange it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8828,1098-133695-0086,missus touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8829,1098-133695-0087,ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick he had been watching her it had seemed to him her temper was involved an accident that might be interesting but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8830,1098-133695-0088,nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt for himself he was annoyed at his mother though he thought she was right above stairs the two ladies separated at missus touchett's door isabel had said nothing on her way up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8831,1098-133695-0089,isabel considered i'm not vexed but i'm surprised and a good deal mystified wasn't it proper i should remain in the drawing room not in the least young girls here in decent houses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8832,1098-133695-0090,don't sit alone with the gentlemen late at night you were very right to tell me then said isabel i don't understand it but i'm very glad to know it i shall always tell you her aunt answered whenever i see you taking what seems to me too much liberty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8833,1098-133695-0091,yes i think i'm very fond of them but i always want to know the things one shouldn't do so as to do them asked her aunt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8834,3857-182317-0000,some had over trustful characters like the seals or exploitable characters like cows and chickens and sheep such creatures sentence themselves to be captives by their lack of ambition dogs they have more spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8835,3857-182317-0001,but they have lost their chance of kingship through worshipping us the dog's finer qualities can't be praised too warmly there is a purity about his devotion which makes mere men feel speechless but with all love for dogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8836,3857-182317-0002,one must grant they are vassals not rulers they are too parasitic the one willing servant class of the world and we have betrayed them by making under simians of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8837,3857-182317-0003,loving us they let us stop their developing in tune with their natures and they've patiently tried ever since to adopt ways of ours they have done it too but of course they can't get far it's not their own road,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8838,3857-182317-0004,dogs have more love than integrity they've been true to us yes but they haven't been true to themselves pigs the pig is remarkably intelligent and brave but he's gross,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8839,3857-182317-0005,and grossness delays one's achievement it takes so much time the snake too though wise has a way of eating himself into stupors if super snake men had had banquets they would have been too vast to describe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8840,3857-182317-0006,and well should the elephant know it he had the best chance of all wiser even than the lion or the wisest of apes his wisdom furthermore was benign where theirs was sinister consider his dignity his poise and skill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8841,3857-182317-0007,he was plastic too he had learned to eat many foods and endure many climates once some say this race explored the globe their bones are found everywhere in south america even,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8842,3857-182317-0008,so the elephants columbus may have found some road here before ours they are cosmopolitans these suave and well bred beings they have rich emotional natures long memories loyalty they are steady and sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8843,3857-182317-0009,and not narrow not self absorbed for they seem interested in everything what was it then that put them out of the race could it have been a quite natural belief that they had already won and when they saw that they hadn't,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8844,3857-182317-0010,and that the monkey men were getting ahead were they too great minded and decent to exterminate their puny rivals it may have been their tolerance and patience that betrayed them they wait too long before they resent an imposition or insult,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8845,3857-182317-0011,just as ants are too energetic and cats too shrewd for their own highest good so the elephants suffer from too much patience their exhibitions of it may seem superb such power and such restraint combined are noble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8846,3857-182317-0012,more live and let live in allowing other species to stay here our way is to kill good and bad male and female and babies till the few last survivors lie hidden away from our guns,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8847,3857-182317-0013,all species must surrender unconditionally those are our terms and come and live in barns alongside us or on us as parasites the creatures that want to live a life of their own we call wild if wild,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8848,3857-182317-0014,then no matter how harmless we treat them as outlaws and those of us who are specially well brought up shoot them for fun some might be our friends we don't wish it we keep them all terrorized,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8849,3857-182317-0015,when one of us conquering monkey men enters the woods most animals that scent him slink away or race off in a panic it is not that we have planned this deliberately but they know what we're like race by race they have been slaughtered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8850,3857-182317-0016,soon all will be gone we give neither freedom nor life room to those we defeat if we had been as strong as the elephants we might have been kinder when great power comes naturally to people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8851,3857-182317-0017,it is used more urbanely we use it as parvenus do because that's what we are the elephant being born to it is easy going confident tolerant he would have been a more humane king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8852,3857-182317-0018,the elephant is stupid when it comes to learning how to use tools so are all other species except our own isn't it strange a tool in the most primitive sense is any object lying around,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8853,3857-182317-0019,that can obviously be used as an instrument for this or that purpose many creatures use objects as materials as birds use twigs for nests but the step that no animal takes is learning freely to use things as instruments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8854,3857-182317-0020,when an elephant plucks off a branch and swishes his flanks and thus keeps away insects he is using a tool but he does it only by a vague and haphazard association of ideas if he once became a conscious user of tools,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8855,3857-182317-0021,he would of course go much further we ourselves who are so good at it now were slow enough in beginning think of the long epochs that passed before it entered our heads,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8856,3857-182317-0022,and all that while the contest for leadership blindly went on without any species making use of this obvious aid the lesson to be learned was simple the reward was the rule of a planet yet only one species our own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8857,3857-182317-0023,has ever had that much brains it makes you wonder what other obvious lessons may still be unlearned it is not necessarily stupid however to fail to use tools to use tools involves using reason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8858,3857-182317-0024,instead of sticking to instinct now sticking to instinct has its disadvantages but so has using reason whichever faculty you use the other atrophies and partly deserts you we are trying to use both,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8859,3857-182317-0025,but we still don't know which has the more value a sudden vision comes to me of one of the first far away ape men who tried to use reason instead of instinct as a guide for his conduct i imagine him perched in his tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8860,3857-182317-0026,torn between those two voices wailing loudly at night by a river in his puzzled distress my poor far off brother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8861,3857-182317-0027,and thereafter achieve a high civilization but that wasn't the problem the real problem,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8862,3857-182317-0028,some quenchless desire to urge them on and on and also adaptability of a thousand kinds to their environment the rhinoceros cares little for adaptability he slogs through the world but we,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8863,3857-182317-0029,we are experts adaptability is what we depend on we talk of our mastery of nature which sounds very grand but the fact is we respectfully adapt ourselves first to her ways,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8864,3857-182317-0030,we attain no power over nature till we learn natural laws and our lordship depends on the adroitness with which we learn and conform adroitness however is merely an ability to win,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8865,3857-182317-0031,back of it there must be some spur to make us use our adroitness why don't we all die or give up when we're sick of the world because the love of life is reenforced in most energized beings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8866,3857-182317-0032,by some longing that pushes them forward in defeat and in darkness all creatures wish to live and to perpetuate their species of course but those two wishes alone evidently do not carry any race far,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8867,3857-182317-0033,in addition to these a race to be great needs some hunger some itch to spur it up the hard path we lately have learned to call evolution the love of toil in the ants and of craft in cats are examples,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8868,3857-180923-0000,the preceding pages have outlined the career of the second connecticut heavy artillery and have narrated some of the more memorable events of its history enough has been told of what it did to furnish grounds for deducing what it was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8869,3857-180923-0001,but to deal with the regiment on the personal side is hardly possible within the limits of such a sketch as this though it is a matter that cannot be entirely passed by,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8870,3857-180923-0002,made up the organization whose not uneventful existence has been described that they were better men or worse braver men or more patriotic than their descendants and successors would prove under similar conditions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8871,3857-180923-0003,or than the hundreds of thousands of their contemporaries who devoted themselves to the same service is not to be believed yet to have passed through such experiences as have been recounted which became for them for a time the commonplaces of every day life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8872,3857-180923-0004,is enough to place them apart from ordinary men in the eyes of our peace knowing generation in fact to have passed the tests of so fierce a course of education gives them a title to a place thus apart the university man of to day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8873,3857-180923-0005,as the burden of the baccalaureate sermons so frequently testifies is consigned to a special place of responsibility in life because of his training these men surely earned one of special honor by reason of theirs which was too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8874,3857-180923-0006,not like the other preparation alone but also fulfilment the realization of how typical it all was of that generation and that time brings the clearest understanding of the real scope of the civil war,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8875,3857-180923-0007,a number of the officers and men were college graduates when they enlisted and others gained degrees after the war ended the list which follows is however necessarily incomplete in fact an absolutely correct list is no doubt hopelessly impossible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8918,3857-182315-0020,familiar with the ways of evolution elsewhere in the universe we naturally should have wondered what course it would take on this earth even in this out of the way corner of the cosmos we might have reflected and on this tiny star,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8919,3857-182315-0021,it may be of interest to consider the trend of events we should have tried to appraise the different species as they wandered around each with its own set of good and bad characteristics which group we'd have wondered would ever contrive to rule all the rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8921,3857-182315-0023,we might first have considered the lemurs or apes they had hands aesthetically viewed the poor simians were simply grotesque but travelers who knew other planets might have known what beauty may spring from an uncouth beginning in this magic universe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8922,3857-182315-0024,still those frowsy unlovely hordes of apes and monkeys were so completely lacking in signs of kingship they were so flighty too in their ways and had so little purpose and so much love for absurd and idle chatter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8924,3857-182315-0026,the bees or the ants might have seemed to us more promising their smallness of size was not necessarily too much of a handicap they could have made poison their weapon for the subjugation of rivals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8925,3857-182315-0027,and in these orderly insects there are obviously a capacity for labor and co operative labor at that which could carry them far we all know that they have a marked genius great gifts of their own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8928,3857-182315-0030,an ant doesn't have the vote apparently he just has his duties this quality may have something to do with their having groups wars the egotism of their individual spirits is allowed scant expression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8929,3857-182315-0031,so the egotism of the groups is extremely ferocious and active is this one of the reasons why ants fight so much we have seen the same phenomenon occur in certain nations of men and the ants commit atrocities in and after their battles that are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8930,3857-182315-0032,i wish i could truly say inhuman but conversely ants are absolutely unselfish within the community they are skilful ingenious their nests and buildings are relatively larger than man's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

8933,3857-182315-0035,a thoughtful observer would have weighed all these excellent qualities when we think of these creatures as little men which is all wrong of course we see they have their faults to our eyes they seem too orderly for instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8934,3857-182315-0036,repressively so their ways are more fixed than those of the old egyptians and their industry is painful to think of it's hyper chinese but we must remember this is a simian comment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8935,3857-182315-0037,the instincts of the species that you and i belong to are of an opposite kind and that makes it hard for us to judge ants fairly but we and the ants are alike in one matter the strong love of property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8936,3857-182315-0038,and instead of merely struggling with nature for it they also fight other ants the custom of plunder seems to be a part of most of their wars this has gone on for ages among them and continues today,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8937,3857-182315-0039,raids ferocious combats and loot are part of an ant's regular life ant reformers if there were any might lay this to their property sense and talk of abolishing property as a cure for the evil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8938,3857-182315-0040,but that would not help for long unless they could abolish the love of it ants seem to care even more for property than we do ourselves we men are inclined to ease up a little when we have all we need,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8939,3857-182315-0041,they can't bear to stop they keep right on working this means that ants do not contemplate they heed nothing outside of their own little rounds it is almost as though their fondness for labor had closed fast their minds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8940,3857-182315-0042,conceivably they might have developed inquiring minds but this would have run against their strongest instincts the ant is knowing and wise but he doesn't know enough to take a vacation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8941,3857-182315-0043,would they have been able therewith to rule their instincts or to stop work long enough to examine themselves or the universe or to dream of any noble development probably not reason is seldom or never the ruler,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8942,3857-182315-0044,it is the servant of instinct it would therefore have told the ants that incessant toil was useful and good toil has brought you up from the ruck of things reason would have plausibly said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8943,3857-182315-0045,it's by virtue of feverish toil that you have become what you are being endlessly industrious is the best road for you to the heights,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8944,6078-54007-0000,ill luck and the fiddler once upon a time saint nicholas came down into the world to take a peep at the old place and see how things looked in the spring time on he stepped along the road to the town where he used to live,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8945,6078-54007-0001,for he had a notion to find out whether things were going on nowadays as they one time did by and by he came to a cross road and who should he see sitting there but ill luck himself ill luck's face was as gray as ashes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8946,6078-54007-0002,and his hair as white as snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8947,6078-54007-0003,and two great wings grew out of his shoulders for he flies fast and comes quickly to those whom he visits does ill luck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8948,6078-54007-0004,which he kept cracking and eating as he trudged along the road and just then he came upon one with a worm hole in it when he saw ill luck it came into his head to do a good turn to poor sorrowful man good morning ill luck says he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8949,6078-54007-0005,even if it be through a key hole now is that so yes says ill luck it is well look now friend says saint nicholas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8950,6078-54007-0006,yes says ill luck i could indeed i should like to see you says saint nicholas for then i should be of a mind to believe what people say of you well says ill luck i have not much time to be pottering and playing upon jack's fiddle but to oblige an old friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8951,6078-54007-0007,then what do you think saint nicholas did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8952,6078-54007-0008,and no sooner had ill luck entered the nut than he stuck the plug in the hole and there was man's enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8953,6078-54007-0009,so says saint nicholas that's a piece of work well done then he tossed the hazel nut under the roots of an oak tree near by and went his way and that is how this story begins well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8954,6078-54007-0010,nobody met with ill luck but one day who should come travelling that way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8955,6078-54007-0011,and phst pop out came ill luck along with it plague take the fiddler say i listen says ill luck it has been many a long day that i have been in that hazel nut and you are the man that has let me out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8956,6078-54007-0012,for once in a way i will do a good turn to a poor human body therewith and without giving the fiddler time to speak a word ill luck caught him up by the belt and whiz away he flew like a bullet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8957,6078-54007-0013,then away he flew to attend to other matters of greater need when the fiddler had gathered his wits together and himself to his feet he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and fruit trees and marble walks and what not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8958,6078-54007-0014,all built of white marble with a fountain in front and peacocks strutting about on the lawn well the fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a bit and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house at the end of the garden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8959,6078-54007-0015,he entered the door and nobody said no to him then he passed through one room after another and each was finer than the one he left behind many servants stood around but they only bowed and never asked whence he came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8960,6078-54007-0016,the table was spread with a feast that smelled so good that it brought tears to the fiddler's eyes and water to his mouth and all the plates were of pure gold the little old man sat alone but another place was spread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8961,6078-54007-0017,do not say that sit down to the table and eat and when i have told you all you will say it was not ill luck but good luck that brought you the fiddler had his own mind about that but all the same down he sat at the table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8962,6078-54007-0018,and fell to with knife and fork at the good things as though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of sundays i am the richest man in the world says the little old man after a while i am glad to hear it says the fiddler you may well be said the old man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8963,6078-54007-0019,and without wife or child and this morning i said to myself that the first body that came to my house i would take for a son or a daughter as the case might be you are the first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8964,6078-54007-0020,and so you shall live with me as long as i live and after i am gone everything that i have shall be yours the fiddler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth as though he would never shut either again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8965,6078-54007-0021,everything the fiddler wanted came to his hand he lived high and slept soft and warm and never knew what it was to want either more or less or great or small in all of those three or four days he did nothing but enjoy himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8966,6078-54007-0022,with might and main but by and by he began to wonder where all the good things came from then before long he fell to pestering the old man with questions about the matter at first the old man put him off with short answers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8967,6078-54007-0023,but the fiddler was a master hand at finding out anything he wanted to know he dinned and drummed and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer so at last the old man said that he would show him the treasure house where all his wealth came from,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8968,6078-54007-0024,and at that the fiddler was tickled beyond measure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8969,6078-54007-0025,there in a corner by the wall was a great trap door of iron the old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it he lifted the door and then went down a steep flight of stone steps and the fiddler followed close at his heels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8970,6078-54007-0026,down below it was as light as day for in the centre of the room hung a great lamp that shone with a bright light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8971,6078-54007-0027,you must never open that door yonder at the back of the room should you do so ill luck will be sure to overtake you oh no the fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as opening the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8972,6078-54007-0028,and out into the sunlight again it took him maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had brought up with him after he had done that he began to wonder what was inside of the little door at the back of the room first he wondered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8973,6078-54007-0029,perhaps i can see what is there without opening the door so down he took the key and off he marched to the garden he opened the trap door and went down the steep steps to the room below there was the door at the end of the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8974,6078-54007-0030,but when he came to look there was no key hole to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8975,6078-54007-0031,he heard a sound like the waves beating on the shore well says he this is the most curious thing i have seen for a long time since i have come so far i may as well see the end of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8976,6078-54007-0032,so he entered the passageway and closed the door behind him he went on and on and the spark of light kept growing larger and larger and by and by pop out he came at the other end of the passage sure enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8977,6078-54007-0033,there he stood on the sea shore with the waves beating and dashing on the rocks he stood looking and wondering to find himself in such a place when all of a sudden something came with a whiz and a rush and caught him by the belt and away he flew like a bullet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8978,6078-54007-0034,by and by he managed to screw his head around and look up and there it was ill luck that had him i thought so said the fiddler and then he gave over kicking well on and on they flew over hill and valley over moor and mountain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8979,6078-54007-0035,until they came to another garden and there ill luck let the fiddler drop swash down he fell into the top of an apple tree and there he hung in the branches it was the garden of a royal castle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8980,6078-54007-0036,and all had been weeping and woe though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again and this was the reason why the king of that country had died and no one was left behind him but the queen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8981,6078-54007-0037,and so she had come out into the garden for a bit of rest and there she sat under the shade of an apple tree fanning herself and crying when swash down fell the fiddler into the apple tree and down fell a dozen apples,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8982,6078-54007-0038,you fell from heaven for i saw it with my eyes and heard it with my ears i see how it is now you were sent hither from heaven to be my husband and my husband you shall be you shall be king of this country half and half with me as queen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8983,6078-54007-0039,and shall sit on a throne beside me you can guess whether or not that was music to the fiddler's ears so the princes were sent packing and the fiddler was married to the queen and reigned in that country well three or four days passed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8984,6078-54007-0040,and all was as sweet and happy as a spring day but at the end of that time the fiddler began to wonder what was to be seen in the castle the queen was very fond of him and was glad enough to show him all the fine things that were to be seen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8985,6078-54007-0041,you must not ask or wish to know should you open that door ill luck will be sure to overtake you pooh said the fiddler i don't care to know anyhow and off they went hand in hand yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8986,6078-54007-0042,that was a very fine thing to say but before an hour had gone by the fiddler's head began to hum and buzz like a beehive i don't believe said he there would be a grain of harm in my peeping inside that door all the same,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8987,6078-54007-0043,why look says he it is just like the door at the rich man's house over yonder i wonder if it is the same inside as outside and he opened the door and peeped in yes there was the long passage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8988,6078-54007-0044,and the spark of light at the far end as though the sun were shining he cocked his head to one side and listened yes said he i think i hear the water rushing but i am not sure i will just go a little further in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8989,6078-54007-0045,and listen and so he entered and closed the door behind him well he went on and on until pop there he was out at the farther end and before he knew what he was about he had stepped out upon the sea shore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8990,6078-54007-0046,away flew the fiddler like a bullet and there was ill luck carrying him by the belt again away they sped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8991,6078-54007-0047,until the fiddler's head grew so dizzy that he had to shut his eyes suddenly ill luck let him drop and down he fell thump bump on the hard ground then he opened his eyes and sat up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8992,6078-54007-0048,or else i would have been a king if it had not been for ill luck and that is the way we all of us talk doctor faustus had sat all the while neither drinking ale nor smoking tobacco but with his hands folded and in silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8993,6078-54007-0049,i know not why it is said he but that story of yours my friend brings to my mind a story of a man whom i once knew a great magician in his time and a necromancer and a chemist and an alchemist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8994,6078-54007-0050,and a rhetorician an astronomer an astrologer and a philosopher as well tis a long list of excellency said old bidpai,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8995,6078-54007-0051,nay said saint george everything must have a name it hath no name said doctor faustus but i shall give it a name and it shall be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8996,6078-54013-0000,once upon a time there was a servant who served a wise man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8997,6078-54013-0001,day after day time in and time out for seven years in those years the servant was well enough contented but no one likes to abide in the same place forever and so one day he took it into his head that he would like to go out into the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8998,6078-54013-0002,to see what kind of a fortune a man might make there for himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
8999,6078-54013-0003,you have served me faithfully these seven years gone and now that you ask leave to go you shall go but it is little or nothing in the way of money that i can give you and so you will have to be content with what i can afford,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9000,6078-54013-0004,see here is a little pebble and its like is not to be found in the seven kingdoms for whoever holds it in his mouth can hear while he does so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9001,6078-54013-0005,paying his way with the few pennies he had saved in his seven years of service but for all of his travelling nothing of good happened to him until one morning he came to a lonely place where there stood a gallows and there he sat him down to rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9002,6078-54013-0006,and it is just in such an unlikely place as this that a man's best chance of fortune comes to him sometimes as the servant sat there there came two ravens flying and lit upon the cross beam overhead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9003,6078-54013-0007,there they began talking to one another and the servant popped the pebble into his mouth to hear what they might say yonder is a traveller in the world said the first raven yes said the second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9004,6078-54013-0008,why thus said the second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9005,6078-54013-0009,and there he would find a man sitting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9006,6078-54013-0010,that man would lead him to the garden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9007,6078-54013-0011,the fruit of happiness said the first raven and of what use would the fruit of happiness be to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9008,6078-54013-0012,and wish and whatever one asks for one shall have you may guess that when the servant understood the talk of the ravens he was not slow in making use of what he heard up he scrambled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9009,6078-54013-0013,and away he went as fast as his legs could carry him on and on he travelled until he came to the cross roads and the stone cross of which the raven spoke and there sure enough sat the traveller,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9010,6078-54013-0014,there is one condition you must fulfil many strange things will happen upon our journey between here and there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9011,6078-54013-0015,and say not a word do you agree to that yes said the servant i do very well said his new comrade then let us be jogging,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9012,6078-54013-0016,and the time is none too long to get there so all the rest of that day they journeyed onward together until towards evening they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs and tall spires,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9013,6078-54013-0017,the servant's companion entered the gate as though he knew the place right well and led the way up one street and down another until by and by they came to a noble house that stood a little apart by itself with gardens of flowers and fruit trees all around it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9014,6078-54013-0018,there the travelling companion stopped and drawing out a little pipe from under his jacket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9015,6078-54013-0019,to listen to the music well he played and played until by and by the door opened and out came a serving man ho piper said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9016,6078-54013-0020,where dozens of servants were serving a fine feast but only one man sat at table a young man with a face so sorrowful that it made a body's heart ache to look upon him can you play good music piper said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9017,6078-54013-0021,but suddenly everything went wrong his wife and he fell out and quarrelled until there was no living together and she had to go back to her old home then his companions deserted him and now he lived all alone yours is a hard case said the travelling companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9018,6078-54013-0022,thereupon he drew out his pipes and began to play and it was such a tune as no man ever listened to before he played and he played and after a while one after another of those who listened to him began to get drowsy first they winked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9019,6078-54013-0023,then they shut their eyes and then they nodded until all were as dumb as logs and as sound asleep as though they would never waken again only the servant and the piper stayed awake for the music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9020,6078-54013-0024,then when all but they two were tight and fast asleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9021,6078-54013-0025,and stepping up to the young man took from off his finger a splendid ruby ring as red as blood and as bright as fire and popped the same into his pocket and all the while the serving man stood gaping like a fish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9022,6078-54013-0026,to see what his comrade was about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9023,6078-54013-0027,none was more ugly than this to bewitch the poor sorrowful young man into a sleep and then to rob him of his ruby ring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9024,6078-54013-0028,but the next day they jogged on together again until by and by they came to a great forest there they wandered up and down till night came upon them and found them still stumbling onward through the darkness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9025,6078-54013-0029,he seemed to doubt nothing nor fear nothing but trudged straight ahead until by and by they saw a light twinkling far away and when they came to it they found a gloomy stone house as ugly as eyes ever looked upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9026,6078-54013-0030,up stepped the servant's comrade and knocked upon the door rap tap tap by and by it was opened a crack and there stood an ugly old woman blear eyed and crooked and gnarled as a winter twig,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9027,6078-54013-0031,no matter for that said the travelling companion we can go no farther to night so you must let us in and hide us as best you may and in he went as he said with the servant at his heels,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9028,6078-54013-0032,trembling like a leaf at what he had heard the old woman gave them some bread and meat to eat and then hid them away in the great empty meal chest in the corner and there they lay as still as mice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9029,6078-54013-0033,by and by in came the gang of thieves with a great noise and uproar and down they sat to their supper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9030,6078-54013-0034,how they had cruelly robbed and murdered poor people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9031,6078-54013-0035,he drew from his pocket the ruby ring which he had stolen from the sorrowful young man's finger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9032,6078-54013-0036,then he led the way out of the house and if the serving man had wondered the day before at that which the comrade did he wondered ten times more to see him give so beautiful a ring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9033,6078-54013-0037,the two travellers came to a little hut neat enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9034,6078-54013-0038,and there the comrade knocked upon the door and asked for lodging,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9035,6078-54013-0039,nevertheless they made the travellers welcome and set before them the very best that was to be had in the house and after both had eaten and drunk they showed them to bed in a corner as clean as snow and there they slept the night through,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9036,6078-54013-0040,but the next morning before the dawning of the day the travelling companion was stirring again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9037,6078-54013-0041,for i have a bit of work to do before i leave this place and strange work it was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9038,6078-54013-0042,he gathered together a great heap of straw and sticks of wood and stuffed all under the corner of the house then he struck a light and set fire to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9039,6078-54013-0043,all was a red blaze behind them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9040,6078-54013-0044,on they jogged and by the time evening was at hand they had come to a neat cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9041,6078-54013-0045,in this cottage lived a widow and her only son and they also made the travellers welcome and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed this time the travelling comrade did neither good nor ill to those of the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9042,6078-54013-0046,but in the morning he told the widow whither they were going and asked if she and her son knew the way to the garden where grew the fruit of happiness yes said she that we do for the garden is not a day's journey from here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9043,6078-54013-0047,and my son himself shall go with you to show you the way that is good said the servant's comrade and if he will do so i will pay him well for his trouble so the young man put on his hat and took up his stick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9044,6078-54013-0048,and off went the three up hill and down dale until by and by they came over the top of the last hill and there below them lay the garden and what a sight it was the leaves shining and glistening like so many jewels in the sunlight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9045,6078-54013-0049,all he could do was to stand and look,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9046,6078-54013-0050,torrent without a bridge for a body to cross over yonder is what you seek said the young man pointing with his finger and there you can see for yourself the fruit of happiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9047,6078-54013-0051,but suddenly catching the widow's son by the collar he lifted him and flung him into the black rushing water splash went the young man and then away he went whirling over rocks and water falls there cried the comrade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9048,6078-54013-0052,that is your reward for your service,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9049,6078-54013-0053,he found his tongue at last and all that he had bottled up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9050,6078-54013-0054,such abuse as he showered upon his travelling companion no man ever listened to before but to all the servant said the other answered never a word until he had stopped for sheer want of breath then poor fool said the travelling companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9051,6078-54013-0055,thereupon as he ended speaking he struck his staff upon the ground instantly the earth trembled and the sky darkened overhead until it grew as black as night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9052,6078-54013-0056,the garden and the torrent and all were gone and nothing was left but a naked plain covered over with the bones of those who had come that way before seeking the fruit which the travelling servant had sought it was a long time before the servant found his way back into the world again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9053,6078-54013-0057,but what a change he beheld it was a poor cottage no longer but a splendid palace fit for a queen to dwell in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9054,6078-54013-0058,and she was dressed in clothes fit for a queen to wear shining with gold and silver and precious stones the servant stood and stared like one bereft of wits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9055,6078-54013-0059,an angel came and showed the way to my son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9056,6078-54013-0060,but to bring an apple for me also then the poor travelling servant began to thump his head he saw well enough through the millstone now and that he too might have had one of the fruit if he had but held his tongue a little longer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9057,6078-54013-0061,the house that he had seen the angel set fire to there he beheld masons and carpenters hard at work hacking and hewing and building a fine new house and there he saw the poor man himself standing by giving them orders how is this said the travelling servant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9058,6078-54013-0062,for many a long day and never knew that a great treasure of silver and gold was hidden beneath it until a few days ago there came an angel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9059,6078-54013-0063,the next morning the poor servant jogged along on his homeward way more sad and downcast than ever and by evening he had come to the robbers den in the thick woods and there the old woman came running to the door to meet him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9060,6078-54013-0064,he gave it to the captain of the band and after he had gone the robbers fought for it with one another until they were all killed so now the world is rid of them and travellers can come and go as they please back jogged the travelling servant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9077,3982-182255-0001,as to the government of this city said mister newberry leaning back in a leather armchair at the mausoleum club and lighting a second cigar it's rotten that's all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9080,3982-182255-0004,and then leaning forwards in his chair and looking carefully about the corridors of the club he spoke behind his hand and said and the mayor's the biggest grafter of the lot and what's more he added,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9083,3982-182255-0007,not argumentatively or with any heat but with the reflective sadness that steals over an elderly man when he sits in the leather armchair of a comfortable club smoking a good cigar and musing on the decadence of the present day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9084,3982-182255-0008,the rottenness of the federal government didn't anger them it merely grieved them they could remember both of them how different everything was when they were young men just entering on life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9085,3982-182255-0009,when mister newberry and mister dick overend were young men went into congress from pure patriotism there was no such thing as graft or crookedness as they both admitted in those days and as for the united states senate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9086,3982-182255-0010,here their voices were almost hushed in awe why when they were young the united states senate but no neither of them could find a phrase big enough for their meaning they merely repeated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9087,3982-182255-0011,and then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey and soda then naturally speaking of the rottenness of the federal government had led them to talk of the rottenness of the state legislature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9088,3982-182255-0012,how different from the state legislatures that they remembered as young men not merely different in the matter of graft but different so mister newberry said in the calibre of the men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9089,3982-182255-0013,he recalled how he had been taken as a boy of twelve by his father to hear a debate he would never forget it giants he said that was what they were in fact the thing was more like a witenagemot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9090,3982-182255-0014,than a legislature he said he distinctly recalled a man whose name he didn't recollect speaking on a question he didn't just remember what either for or against,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9091,3982-182255-0015,it thrilled him he would never forget it it stayed in his memory as if it were yesterday but as for the present legislature here mister dick overend sadly nodded assent in advance to what he knew was coming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9092,3982-182255-0016,as for the present legislature well mister newberry had had he said occasion to visit the state capital a week before in connection with a railway bill that he was trying to that is that he was anxious to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9093,3982-182255-0017,from speaking of the crookedness of the state government mister newberry and mister dick overend were led to talk of the crookedness of the city government and they both agreed as above that things were worse than in russia what secretly irritated them both most,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9094,3982-182255-0018,was that they had lived and done business under this infernal corruption for thirty or forty years and hadn't noticed it they had been too busy the fact was that their conversation reflected not so much their own original ideas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9095,3982-182255-0019,as a general wave of feeling that was passing over the whole community there had come a moment quite suddenly it seemed when it occurred to everybody at the same time that the whole government of the city was rotten the word is a strong one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9096,3982-182255-0020,but it is the one that was used look at the aldermen they said rotten look at the city solicitor rotten and as for the mayor himself phew the thing came like a wave,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9097,3982-182255-0021,everybody felt it at once people wondered how any sane intelligent community could tolerate the presence of a set of corrupt scoundrels like the twenty aldermen of the city their names it was said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9098,3982-182255-0022,were simply a byword throughout the united states for rank criminal corruption this was said so widely that everybody started hunting through the daily papers to try to find out who in blazes were aldermen anyhow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9099,3982-182255-0023,and as a matter of fact at the moment when this wave of feeling struck the city nobody knew or cared who were aldermen anyway to tell the truth the aldermen had been much the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years some were in the produce business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9100,3982-182255-0024,others were butchers two were grocers and all of them wore blue checkered waistcoats and red ties and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets nobody had ever really thought about them that is to say nobody on plutoria avenue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9101,3982-182255-0025,sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it one said oh i see an alderman and turned to something else whose funeral is that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9102,3982-182255-0026,a man would sometimes ask on plutoria avenue oh just one of the city aldermen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9103,3982-182255-0027,oh i see i beg your pardon i thought it might be somebody important,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9104,3982-182255-0028,how and where this movement of indignation had started people said that it was part of a new wave of public morality that was sweeping over the entire united states certainly it was being remarked in almost every section of the country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9105,3982-182255-0029,chicago newspapers were attributing its origin to the new vigour and the fresh ideals of the middle west in boston it was said to be due to a revival of the grand old new england spirit in philadelphia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9106,3982-182255-0030,they called it the spirit of william penn in the south it was said to be the reassertion of southern chivalry making itself felt against the greed and selfishness of the north while in the north they recognized it at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9107,3982-182255-0031,as a protest against the sluggishness and ignorance of the south in the west they spoke of it as a revolt against the spirit of the east and in the east they called it a reaction against the lawlessness of the west but everywhere they hailed it as a new sign of the glorious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9108,3982-182255-0032,unity of the country if therefore mister newberry and mister overend were found to be discussing the corrupt state of their city they only shared in the national sentiments of the moment in fact in the same city hundreds of other citizens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9109,3982-182255-0033,as disinterested as themselves were waking up to the realization of what was going on as soon as people began to look into the condition of things in the city they were horrified at what they found it was discovered for example,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9110,3982-182255-0034,in a city with a hundred and fifty deaths a week and sometimes even better an undertaker sat on the council a city that was about to expropriate land and to spend four hundred thousand dollars for a new cemetery had an undertaker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9111,3982-182255-0035,on the expropriation committee itself and worse than that alderman undercutt was a butcher in a city that consumed a thousand tons of meat every week and alderman o'hooligan it leaked out was an irishman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9112,3982-182255-0036,imagine it an irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where thirty eight and a half out of every hundred policemen were irish either by birth or parentage the thing was monstrous so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9113,3982-182255-0037,when mister newberry said it's worse than russia he meant it every word now just as mister newberry and mister dick overend were finishing their discussion the huge bulky form of mayor mc grath came ponderously past them as they sat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9114,3982-182255-0038,he looked at them sideways out of his eyes he had eyes like plums in a mottled face and being a born politician he knew by the very look of them that they were talking of something that they had no business to be talking about but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9115,3982-182255-0039,being a politician he merely said good evening gentlemen without a sign of disturbance good evening mister mayor said mister newberry rubbing his hands feebly together and speaking in an,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9116,3982-182255-0040,ingratiating tone there is no more pitiable spectacle than an honest man caught in the act of speaking boldly and fearlessly of the evil doer good evening mister mayor echoed mister dick overend also rubbing his hands,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9117,3982-182255-0041,warm evening is it not the mayor gave no other answer than that deep guttural grunt which is technically known in municipal interviews as refusing to commit oneself did he hear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9142,3982-178459-0020,let me think it's something that happened since our walk this morning yes since you left me at noon something happened that she stopped abruptly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9143,3982-178459-0021,with a tremulous murmur of amazement and dawning comprehension she remembered that sibyl had gone to the new house bibbs swallowed painfully and contrived to say i do i do want you to marry me if if,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9145,3982-178459-0023,in love with you no he said somewhere in the still air of the room there was a whispered word it did not seem to come from mary's parted lips but he was aware of it why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9146,3982-178459-0024,i've had nothing but dreams bibbs said desolately but they weren't like that sibyl said no girl could care about me he smiled faintly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9147,3982-178459-0025,and when i first came home edith told me sibyl was so anxious to marry that she'd have married me she meant it to express sibyl's extremity you see but i hardly needed either of them to tell me i hadn't thought of myself as,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9148,3982-178459-0026,well not as particularly captivating oddly enough mary's pallor changed to an angry flush those two she exclaimed sharply and then with thoroughgoing contempt lamhorn that's like them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9149,3982-178459-0027,she turned away went to the bare little black mantel and stood leaning upon it presently she asked when did missus roscoe sheridan say that no girl could care about you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9150,3982-178459-0028,to day mary drew a deep breath i think i'm beginning to understand a little she bit her lip there was anger in good truth in her eyes and in her voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9152,3982-178459-0030,i heard her say i think i know what happened now mary's breath came fast and her voice shook but she spoke rapidly you heard her say more than that you heard her say that we were bitterly poor and on that account i tried first to marry your brother and then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9153,3982-178459-0031,and then that i tried to marry you you heard her say that and you believe that i don't care for you and that no girl could care for you but you think i am in such an extremity as sibyl was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9154,3982-178459-0032,you took your father's offer and then came to ask me to marry you what had i shown you of myself that could make you suddenly she sank down kneeling with her face buried in her arms upon the lap of a chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9155,3982-178459-0033,tears overwhelming her mary mary he cried helplessly oh no you you don't understand i do though she sobbed i do he came and stood beside her you kill me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9157,3982-178459-0035,you seemed to lean down out of a rosy cloud to be kind to me i never dreamed i could do anything for you i never dreamed you could need anything to be done for you by anybody,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9158,3982-178459-0036,and to day i heard that that you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9159,3982-178459-0037,anybody with money she sobbed and you thought we were so so desperate you believed that i had no he said quickly i didn't believe you'd done one kind thing for me for that no no no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9160,3982-178459-0038,i knew you'd never thought of me except generously to give i said i couldn't make it plain he cried despairingly wait she lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously like a child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9161,3982-178459-0039,help me up bibbs then when she was once more upon her feet she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him ruefully and faintly but reassuringly as if to tell him in that way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9162,3982-178459-0040,that she knew he had not meant to hurt her and that smile of hers so lamentable but so faithfully friendly misted his own eyes for his shamefacedness lowered them no more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9163,3982-178459-0041,let me tell you what you want to tell me she said you can't because you can't put it into words they are too humiliating for me and you're too gentle to say them tell me though isn't it true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9164,3982-178459-0042,you didn't believe that i'd tried to make you fall in love with me never never for an instant you didn't believe i'd tried to make you want to marry me no no no i believe it bibbs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9165,3982-178459-0043,you thought that i was fond of you you knew i cared for you but you didn't think i might be in love with you but you thought that i might marry you without being in love with you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9166,3982-178459-0044,because you did believe i had tried to marry your brother and mary i only knew for the first time that you that you were were desperately poor she said you can't even say that bibbs it was true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9167,3982-178459-0045,i did try to make jim want to marry me i did and she sank down into the chair weeping bitterly again bibbs was agonized mary he groaned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9168,3982-178459-0046,i didn't know you could cry listen she said listen till i get through i want you to understand we were poor and we weren't fitted to be we never had been and we didn't know what to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9169,3982-178459-0047,we'd been almost rich there was plenty but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the town he wanted to be richer but instead well just about the time your father finished building next door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9170,3982-178459-0048,we found we hadn't anything people say that sometimes meaning that they haven't anything in comparison with other people of their own kind but we really hadn't anything we hadn't anything at all bibbs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9171,3982-178459-0049,you might wonder why i didn't,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9172,3982-178459-0050,and i wonder myself why when a family loses its money people always say the daughters ought to go and be stenographers it's curious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9173,3982-178459-0051,no i'd been raised to be either married comfortably or a well to do old maid if i chose not to marry the poverty came on slowly bibbs but at last it was all there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9174,3982-178459-0052,and i didn't know how to be a stenographer i didn't know how to be anything except a well to do old maid or somebody's wife and i couldn't be a well to do old maid then bibbs i did what i'd been raised to know how to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9175,3982-178459-0053,i went out to be fascinating and be married i did it openly at least and with a kind of decent honesty i told your brother i had meant to fascinate him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9176,3982-178459-0054,but i let him think that perhaps i meant to marry him i think i did mean to marry him i had never cared for anybody and i thought it might be there really wasn't anything more than a kind of excited fondness i can't be sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9177,3982-178459-0055,but i think that though i did mean to marry him i never should have done it because that sort of a marriage is it's sacrilege something would have stopped me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9178,3982-178459-0056,she meant no harm but she was horrible and she put what i was doing into such horrible words and they were the truth oh i saw myself she was proposing a miserable compact with me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9179,3982-178459-0057,and i couldn't breathe the air of the same room with her though i'd so cheapened myself she had a right to assume that i would but i couldn't i left her and i wrote to your brother just a quick scrawl i told him just what i'd done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9181,3982-178459-0059,she pressed her clenched hands tightly against her eyes leaning far forward her head bowed before him bibbs had forgotten himself long ago his heart broke for her couldn't you isn't there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9182,3982-178459-0060,won't you he stammered mary i'm going with father isn't there some way you could use the money without without she gave a choked little laugh you gave me something to live for he said you kept me alive i think,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9183,3982-178459-0061,and i've hurt you like this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9184,3982-178459-0062,oh a thousand times her right hand went out in a faltering gesture and just touched his own for an instant but there's nothing to forgive and you can't you can't,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9185,3982-178459-0063,can't what bibbs you couldn't marry you she said for him yes no no no she sprang up facing him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9186,3982-178459-0064,and without knowing what she did she set her hands upon his breast pushing him back from her a little i can't i can't don't you see mary no no and you must go now bibbs i can't bear any more please,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9187,3982-178459-0065,mary never never never she cried in a passion of tears you mustn't come any more i can't see you dear never never never somehow in helpless stumbling obedience to her beseeching gesture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9188,3982-178459-0066,he got himself to the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9189,4051-11218-0000,greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9190,4051-11218-0001,just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwed up tail and held them in a gripe like that of an iron vice one with his right hand the other with his left,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9191,4051-11218-0002,to be sure but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them and ever since that time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9192,4051-11218-0003,when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns and to gripe him by the tail is pretty much the same thing that is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9193,4051-11218-0004,it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9194,4051-11218-0005,who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed to the plow at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the greensward and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the plowed field lay before him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9195,4051-11218-0006,a large tract of black earth ready to be sown with the dragon's teeth so jason scattered them broadcast and harrowed them into the soil with a brush harrow and took his stand on the edge of the field anxious to see what would happen next,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9196,4051-11218-0007,must we wait long for harvest time he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side whether sooner or later it will be sure to come answered the princess a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragon's teeth have been sown,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9197,4051-11218-0008,and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle but by and by all over the field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9198,4051-11218-0009,like sparkling drops of dew these bright objects sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9199,4051-11218-0010,tore themselves up by the roots wherever a dragon's tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle they made a clangor with their swords against their shields and eyed one another fiercely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9200,4051-11218-0011,full of rage and stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense of the boon of their own existence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9201,4051-11218-0012,and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world like alexander or napoleon to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9202,4051-11218-0013,clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the red hot thirst for battle then they began to shout show us the enemy lead us to the charge death or victory come on brave comrades conquer or die,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9203,4051-11218-0014,and a hundred other outcries such as men always bellow forth on a battle field and which these dragon people seemed to have at their tongues ends at last the front rank caught sight of jason who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9204,4051-11218-0015,had thought it best to draw his sword in a moment all the sons of the dragon's teeth appeared to take jason for an enemy and crying with one voice guard the golden fleece they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9205,4051-11218-0016,the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes when he let fly the stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9206,4051-11218-0017,and instead of running any farther towards jason they began to fight among themselves the confusion spread through the host,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9207,4051-11218-0018,hewing and stabbing at one another lopping off arms heads and legs and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration although at the same time he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9208,4051-11218-0019,for an offense which he himself had committed in an incredibly short space of time almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up all but one of the heroes of the dragon's teeth were stretched lifeless on the field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9209,4051-11218-0020,the last survivor the bravest and strongest of the whole had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and give a shout of exultation crying victory victory immortal fame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9210,4051-11218-0021,when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren and there was the end of the army that had sprouted from the dragon's teeth that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9211,4051-11218-0022,let them sleep in the bed of honor said the princess medea with a sly smile at jason the world will always have simpletons enough just like them fighting and dying for they know not what and fancying that posterity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9212,4051-11218-0023,will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets could you help smiling prince jason to see the self conceit of that last fellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9213,4051-11218-0024,you will think differently in the morning said medea true the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs have an object you know come your night's work has been well performed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9214,4051-11218-0025,that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9215,4051-11218-0026,entering the presence chamber he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obeisance your eyes look heavy prince jason observed the king you appear to have spent a sleepless night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9216,4051-11218-0027,and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazen lunged bulls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9217,4051-11218-0028,the field has been plowed the dragon's teeth have been sown broadcast and harrowed into the soil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9218,4051-11218-0029,and depart with my nine and forty comrades,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9219,4051-11218-0030,and looked very angry and excessively disturbed for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9220,4051-11218-0031,and the dragon's teeth the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon and therefore though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful he was resolved and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9221,4051-11218-0032,not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece you never would have succeeded in this business young man said he if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments had you acted fairly you would have been at this instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9222,4051-11218-0033,to speak my mind plainly you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks jason left the king's presence in great sorrow and anger he could think of nothing better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9223,4051-11218-0034,march at once to the grove of mars slay the dragon take possession of the golden fleece get on board the argo and spread all sail for iolchos the success of this scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9224,4051-11218-0035,at so many mouthfuls by the dragon but as jason was hastening down the palace steps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9225,4051-11218-0036,and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset these enchantresses you must know are never to be depended upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9226,4051-11218-0037,will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble on the contrary answered jason he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragon's teeth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9227,4051-11218-0038,and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece whether i slay the dragon or no yes jason said the princess and i can tell you more unless you set sail from colchis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9228,4051-11218-0039,stealing through the streets of colchis on their way to the sacred grove,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9229,4051-11218-0040,lowing nodding their heads and thrusting forth their snouts which as other cattle do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9230,4051-11218-0041,their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed and with their fierceness the two furnaces in their stomachs had likewise been extinguished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9231,4051-11218-0042,than ever before indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass the fire out of their nostrils had shriveled it up before they could manage to crop it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9232,4051-11218-0043,how they contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor they breathed the very sweetest of cow breath after kindly patting the bulls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9233,4051-11218-0044,jason followed medea's guidance into the grove of mars where the great oak trees that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9234,4051-11218-0045,medea squeezed jason's hand look yonder she whispered do you see it gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance not like the moonbeams but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9235,4051-11218-0046,what is it asked jason have you come so far to seek it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9236,4051-11218-0047,when it glitters before your eyes it is the golden fleece jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze o how beautiful it looked shining with a marvelous light of its own that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9237,4051-11218-0048,prize which so many heroes had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the brazen lunged bulls how gloriously it shines cried jason in a rapture it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9238,4051-11218-0049,the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jason's memory soon however something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9239,4051-11218-0050,for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws after this feat the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9240,4051-11218-0051,on which he felt inclined to finish his meal in various directions he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees stretching out his neck a terrible long way now here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9241,4051-11218-0052,upon my word as the head came waving and undulating through the air and reaching almost within arm's length of prince jason it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9242,4051-11218-0053,the gape of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the king's palace well jason whispered medea for she was ill natured as all enchantresses are and wanted to make the bold youth tremble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9243,4051-11218-0054,what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden fleece jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward stay foolish youth said medea grasping his arm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9244,4051-11218-0055,far more effectually than your sword the dragon had probably heard the voices for swift as lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again darting full forty feet at a stretch as it approached,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9245,4051-11218-0056,medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monster's wide open throat immediately with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle flinging his tail up to the tip top of the tallest tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9246,4051-11218-0057,and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down again the dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless it is only a sleeping potion said the enchantress to prince jason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9247,4051-11218-0058,so i did not wish to kill him outright quick snatch the prize and let us begone you have won the golden fleece jason caught the fleece from the tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9248,4051-11218-0059,with her peacock beside her she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste disappeared among the duskiness of the trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9249,4051-11218-0060,who were disporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible but lynceus with his sharp eyes had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9250,4051-11218-0061,although several stone walls a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9251,4051-11218-0062,held perpendicularly ready to let fall into the water as jason drew near he heard the talking image calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave sweet voice make haste prince jason for your life make haste,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9252,4051-10927-0000,it's late alexey alexandrovitch she said when she had gone through the doorway anna it's necessary for me to have a talk with you with me she said wonderingly she came out from behind the door of the dressing room and looked at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9253,4051-10927-0001,why what is it what about she asked sitting down well let's talk if it's so necessary but it would be better to get to sleep anna said what came to her lips and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9254,4051-10927-0002,how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9255,4051-10927-0003,that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9256,4051-10927-0004,she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9257,4051-10927-0005,that she did not care to say a word about herself meant a great deal he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were closed against him more than that he saw from her tone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9258,4051-10927-0006,that she was not even perturbed at that but as it were said straight out to him yes it's shut up and so it must be and will be in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have returning home and finding his own house locked up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9259,4051-10927-0007,but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexey alexandrovitch i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9260,4051-10927-0008,your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis attracted attention he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9261,4051-10927-0009,i wasn't dull does that offend you alexey alexandrovitch shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9262,4051-10927-0010,anna is this you said alexey alexandrovitch quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his fingers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9263,4051-10927-0011,what do you want of me alexey alexandrovitch paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9264,4051-10927-0012,he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9265,4051-10927-0013,and i beg you to listen to it i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i observed it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9266,4051-10927-0014,but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired i positively don't understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he doesn't care she thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9267,4051-10927-0015,but other people noticed it and that's what upsets him you're not well alexey alexandrovitch she added and she got up and would have gone towards the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her his face was ugly and forbidding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9268,4051-10927-0016,as anna had never seen him she stopped and bending her head back and on one side began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins well i'm listening to what's to come she said calmly and ironically and indeed i listen with interest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9269,4051-10927-0017,began alexey alexandrovitch ferreting in one's soul one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9270,4051-10927-0018,to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9271,4051-10927-0019,i don't understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins anna for god's sake don't speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9272,4051-10927-0020,but believe me what i say i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the word love threw her into revolt again she thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9273,4051-10927-0021,love can he love if he hadn't heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he doesn't even know what love is alexey alexandrovitch really i don't understand she said define what it is you find,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9274,4051-10927-0022,that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9275,4051-10927-0023,in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9276,4051-10927-0024,when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9277,4051-10927-0025,but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and had forgotten about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9278,4051-10927-0026,she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9279,4051-10927-0027,with a new tranquil rhythm it's late it's late she whispered with a smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9280,4051-11217-0000,why if you will believe me they were the sons of that very phrixus who in his childhood had been carried to colchis on the back of the golden fleeced ram since that time phrixus had married the king's daughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9281,4051-11217-0001,and had spent their play days in the outskirts of the grove in the center of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree they were now on their way to greece in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been wrongfully taken from their father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9282,4051-11217-0002,when the princes understood whither the argonauts were going they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9283,4051-11217-0003,every person who might venture within his reach there are other difficulties in the way continued the young princes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9284,4051-11217-0004,i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9285,4051-11217-0005,at all events turn back who may i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden fleece we will none of us turn back cried his nine and forty brave comrades,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9286,4051-11217-0006,much good may it do him and orpheus whose custom it was to set everything to music began to harp and sing most gloriously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9287,4051-11217-0007,and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst after this being now under the guidance of the two princes who were well acquainted with the way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9288,4051-11217-0008,heard of their arrival he instantly summoned jason to court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9289,4051-11217-0009,who dethroned his father you are welcome brave jason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9290,4051-11217-0010,pray are you on a pleasure voyage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9291,4051-11217-0011,or what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court great sir replied jason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9292,4051-11217-0012,for chiron had taught him how to behave with propriety whether to kings or beggars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9293,4051-11217-0013,provided i bring him the golden fleece this as your majesty is aware is now hanging on a tree here at colchis and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away in spite of himself the king's face twisted itself into an angry frown,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9294,4051-11217-0014,for above all things else in the world he prized the golden fleece and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9295,4051-11217-0015,had come to colchis with the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9296,4051-11217-0016,what are the conditions which you must fulfill before getting possession of the golden fleece i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9297,4051-11217-0017,true said the king with a smile that did not look particularly good natured very true young man but there are other things as hard or perhaps a little harder to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon for example,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9298,4051-11217-0018,which vulcan the wonderful blacksmith made for me there is a furnace in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9299,4051-11217-0019,i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly since it stands in the way of my purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9305,4051-11217-0025,he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery so that while looking into them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9312,4051-11217-0032,and warned them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the king's palace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9313,4051-11217-0033,just as they had been pulled out of the monster's jaws by cadmus long ago medea then led jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets of the city and into the royal pasture ground where the two brazen footed bulls were kept it was a starry night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9316,4051-11217-0036,it makes a holiday in colchis whenever such a thing happens for my part i enjoy it immensely you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder are you sure beautiful medea asked jason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9317,4051-11217-0037,the instant he made a step farther,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9318,4051-11217-0038,these you will understand were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds at the first two or three steps which jason made,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9319,4051-11217-0039,the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air he went a little farther,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9320,4051-11217-0040,one other stride did bold jason make and suddenly as a streak of lightning on came these fiery animals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9321,4051-11217-0041,as has always been the fashion with angry bulls their breath scorched the herbage before them so intensely hot it was indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and set it all in a light blaze but as for jason himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9322,6454-107462-0000,patrick deasey described himself as a philosopher psychologist and humorist it was partly because patrick delighted in long words and partly to excuse himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9323,6454-107462-0001,for being full of the sour cream of an inhuman curiosity his curiosity however did not extend itself to science,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9324,6454-107462-0002,at first when deasey retired from the police force with a pension and an heiress with three hundred pounds and time hung heavy on his hands he would try to satisfy this craving through the medium of a host of small,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9325,6454-107462-0003,flirtations with everybody's maid in this way he could inform himself exactly how many loaves were taken by the sweeneys for a week's consumption as compared with those which were devoured by all the cassidys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9326,6454-107462-0004,for whom the bottles at the presbytery went in by the back door and what was the real cause of the quarrel between the twin miss mc inerneys but these were but blackbird scratchings as it were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9327,6454-107462-0005,upon the deep soil of the human heart what deasey cared about was what he called the secrets of the soul never met a man he was wont to say with no backstairs to his mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9328,6454-107462-0006,to ring at the front door of ordinary intercourse was not enough for him when deasey invested his wife's money in a public house he developed a better plan it was the plan which made him ultimately describe himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9329,6454-107462-0007,he would gently close the door of the bar parlour pick up a tumbler breathe on it polish the breath lean one elbow on the bar look round him once again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9330,6454-107462-0008,and setting the whisky bottle betwixt his customer and himself with a nod which said help yourself he would lean forward with the soft indulgent grin of the human man of the world and begin now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9331,6454-107462-0009,but as between frien's certain delicate little facts in your past life have come inadvertently to me hearing sometimes he would allude to a certain document or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9332,6454-107462-0010,incriminating facts or certain letters he would ring the changes on these three according to the sex and temperament with which he had to deal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9333,6454-107462-0011,but always whatever the words whatever the nature or sex the shot would tell first came the little start the straightened figure the pallor or flush,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9334,6454-107462-0012,the shamed and suddenly lit eyes and then who told you mister deasey sir or where did you get the letter ah now that would be telling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9335,6454-107462-0013,deasey would make reply but twas from a certain person whom perhaps we need not name then the whiskey bottle would move forward like a pawn in chess and the next soothing words would be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9336,6454-107462-0014,and your secret is safe with me forthwith the little skeleton in that man's cupboard would lean forward and press upon the door until at last the door flew open and a bone or two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9337,6454-107462-0015,and sometimes the whole skeleton would rattle out upon the floor he had played this game so often that almost at first sight he could classify his dupes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9338,6454-107462-0016,under the three heads into which he had divided them those who demanded with violent threats which melted like snow before the sunshine of john jamieson the letter or the name of the informant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9339,6454-107462-0017,those who asked after a gentle sip or two how the letter had come into his hands and those who asked immediately if the letter hadn't been destroyed as a rule from the type that demanded the letter back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9340,6454-107462-0018,he only caught sight of the tip of the secret's ears from those they were nearly always the women who swiftly asked if he hadn't destroyed the letters he caught shame faced gleams of the truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9341,6454-107462-0019,but those who asked between pensive sips how the facts or the letter had come his way these were the ones who yielded deasey the richest harvest of rattling skeleton bones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9342,6454-107462-0020,indeed it was curiously instructive how john jamieson laid down a causeway of gleaming stepping stones so that deasey might cross lightly over the turgid waters of his victims souls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9343,6454-107462-0021,has been inadvertently revealed to me but is for ever sacred in me breast it was strange to see how from the underworld of the man's mind there would trip out the company of misshapen hobgoblins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9344,6454-107462-0022,and gnomes which had been locked away in darkness maybe this many a year well how would i get the time to clane the childer and to wash their heads and i working all the day at curing stinkin hides,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9345,6454-107462-0023,and he fell over on the side and busted all his veins or well an wouldn't you draw two pinsions yourself mister deasey if you'd a wife with two han's like a sieve for yellow gold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9346,6454-107462-0024,there was one of this nature which troubled his rest long well the way of it was you see he put it up the chimbley but when the chimbley sweepers come he transferred it in his weskit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9347,6454-107462-0025,to my place and i dropped it down the well they found it when they let the bucket down but i wasn't his accomplice at all twas only connivance with me when he had spoken of the chimney and the well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9348,6454-107462-0026,deasey concluded at once it was a foully murdered corpse but then again you could not well conceal a corpse in someone's waistcoat and gold coins would melt or be mislaid amongst the loose bricks of a sooty chimney,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9349,6454-107462-0027,deasey had craved for corpses but nothing so grim as that had risen to his whisky bait until he tried the same old game on missus geraghty what subtle instinct was it that had prompted him to add,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9350,6454-107462-0028,to the first unvarying words but all that is now past and over and safe beneath the mouldering clay at these last words the widow geraghty knew well the barrier was down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9351,6454-107462-0029,that fences off one human soul from another all the same she shook her trembling head when deasey drew the cork at her refusal deasey was struck with the most respectful compassion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9352,6454-107462-0030,until that hour he had never known one single lacerated soul decline this consolation and to look at me she wept forthwith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9353,6454-107462-0031,no ma'am returned deasey to look at you ye'd think ma'am ye could never kill a fly and respectfully he passed the peppermints sometimes the widow muttered i hears it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9354,6454-107462-0032,and the two bright eyes of it and the little clay cold feet deasey knew what was coming now and he twitched in every vein and she so white haired and so regular at church,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9355,6454-107462-0033,and the black bonnet on the head of her an all it was the only little one she had went on the widow bowed almost to the bar by shame and it always perched up on her knee and taking food from her mouth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9356,6454-107462-0034,but i had bad teeth in me head and i couldn't get my rest with the jaws aching and all the whiles it screeching with the croup twould madden you all the same deasey whispered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9357,6454-107462-0035,maybe it wasn't your fault twas maybe your man egged you on to do the shameful deed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9359,6454-107462-0037,this touch of the grey feet laid a spell on deasey's hankering morbidity what turned the feet grey he whispered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9360,6454-120342-0000,ours are not the carollings of your poor shivering little east angles or south mercians where they have to plod round afoot in countries where they do not know what a sleigh ride is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9361,6454-120342-0001,i had asked harry to have sixteen of the best voices in the chapel school to be trained to eight or ten good carols without knowing why we did not care to disappoint them if a february thaw setting in on the twenty fourth of december,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9362,6454-120342-0002,should break up the spree before it began then i had told howland that he must reserve for me a span of good horses and a sleigh that i could pack sixteen small children into tight stowed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9363,6454-120342-0003,howland is always good about such things knew what the sleigh was for having done the same in other years and doubled the span of horses of his own accord because the children would like it better and it would be no difference to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9364,6454-120342-0004,sunday night as the weather nymphs ordered the wind hauled round to the northwest and everything froze hard monday night things moderated and the snow began to fall steadily so steadily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9365,6454-120342-0005,and so tuesday night the metropolitan people gave up their unequal contest all good men and angels rejoicing at their discomfiture and only a few of the people in the very lowest bolgie being ill natured enough to grieve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9366,6454-120342-0006,and without fatigue to horse or man so it was that when i came down with lycidas to the chapel at seven o'clock i found harry had gathered there his eight pretty girls and his eight jolly boys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9367,6454-120342-0007,and had them practising for the last time carol carol christians carol joyfully carol for the coming of christ's nativity i think the children had got inkling of what was coming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9368,6454-120342-0008,or perhaps harry had hinted it to their mothers certainly they were warmly dressed and when fifteen minutes afterwards howland came round himself with the sleigh he had put in as many rugs and bear skins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9369,6454-120342-0009,as if he thought the children were to be taken new born from their respective cradles great was the rejoicing as the bells of the horses rang beneath the chapel windows and harry did not get his last da capo for his last carol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9370,6454-120342-0010,under the full moon on the snow still white with sixteen children at the happiest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9371,6454-120342-0011,there can be nothing better than two or three such hours first driver out on commonwealth avenue that will tone down the horses stop on the left after you have passed fairfield street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9372,6454-120342-0012,so we dashed up to the front of haliburton's palace where he was keeping his first christmas tide and the children whom harry had hushed down for a square or two broke forth with good full voice under his strong lead in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9373,6454-120342-0013,shepherd of tender sheep singing with all that unconscious pathos with which children do sing and starting the tears in your eyes in the midst of your gladness the instant the horses bells stopped their voices began,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9374,6454-120342-0014,in an instant more we saw haliburton and anna run to the window and pull up the shades and in a minute more faces at all the windows and so the children sung through clement's old hymn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9375,6454-120342-0015,little did clement think of bells and snow as he taught it in his sunday school there in alexandria but perhaps to day as they pin up the laurels and the palm in the chapel at alexandria,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9376,6454-120342-0016,they are humming the words not thinking of clement more than he thought of us as the children closed with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9377,6454-120342-0017,haliburton came running out and begged me to bring them in but i told him no as soon as i could hush their shouts of merry christmas that we had a long journey before us and must not alight by the way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9378,6454-120342-0018,and the children broke out with hail to the night hail to the day rather a favorite quicker and more to the childish taste perhaps than the other and with another merry christmas we were off again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9379,6454-120342-0019,we ran the sleigh into a bank on the slope of pinckney street in front of walter's house and before they suspected there that any one had come the children were singing carol carol christians carol joyfully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9380,6454-120342-0020,kisses flung from the window kisses flung back from the street merry christmas again with a good will and then one of the girls began when anna took the baby and pressed his lips to hers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9381,6454-120342-0021,and all of them fell in so cheerily o dear me it is a scrap of old ephrem the syrian if they did but know it and when after this harry would fain have driven on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9382,6454-120342-0022,because two carols at one house was the rule how the little witches begged that they might sing just one song more there because missus alexander had been so kind to them when she showed them about the german stitches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9383,6454-120342-0023,and then up the hill and over to the north end and as far as we could get the horses up into moon court that they might sing to the italian image man who gave lucy the boy and dog in plaster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9384,6454-120342-0024,though chrysostom should have made a few remarks to them seventeen times in the chapel then the italian image man heard for the first time in his life now is the time of christmas come and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9385,6454-120342-0025,jesus in his babes abiding and then we came up hanover street and stopped under mister gerry's chapel where they were dressing the walls with their evergreens and gave them hail to the night hail to the day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9386,6454-120342-0026,and so down state street and stopped at the advertiser office because when the boys gave their literary entertainment mister hale put in their advertisement for nothing and up in the old attic there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9387,6454-120342-0027,and the in general man from his more serious views and the daily the next morning wished everybody a merry christmas with even more unction and resolved that in coming years it would have a supplement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9388,6454-120342-0028,large enough to contain all the good wishes so away again to the houses of confectioners who had given the children candy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9389,6454-120342-0029,to the palaces of millionnaires who had prayed for these children with tears if the children only knew it to doctor frothingham's in summer street i remember where we stopped because the boston association of ministers met there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9390,6454-120342-0030,and out on dover street bridge that the poor chair mender might hear our carols sung once more before he heard them better sung in another world where nothing needs mending,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9391,6454-120342-0031,king of glory king of peace hear the song and see the star welcome be thou heavenly king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9392,6454-120342-0032,and all the others rung out with order or without order breaking the hush directly as the horses bells were stilled thrown into the air with all the gladness of childhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9393,6454-120342-0033,everywhere a little crowd gathered round us and then we dashed away far enough to gather quite another crowd and then back perhaps not sorry to double on our steps if need were and leaving every crowd with a happy thought of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9394,6454-120342-0034,the star the manger and the child at nine we brought up at my house d street three doors from the corner and the children picked their very best for polly and my six little girls to hear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9395,6454-120342-0035,begged that they might stay till the last moment they could walk back from the stable and rather walk than not indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9396,6454-93938-0000,what seemed at the moment an incomprehensible puzzle had as we afterwards learned a very simple explanation one of the g s directors mister baldwin who had come in on mister camp's car,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9397,6454-93938-0001,seeing through the device the party had at once gone to this ranch where the owner baldwin mounted them and it was their dust cloud we had seen as they rode up to ash forks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9398,6454-93938-0002,to make matters more serious baldwin had rounded up his cowboys and brought them along with him in order to make any resistance impossible i made no objection to the sheriff serving the paper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9399,6454-93938-0003,and the stars in their courses are against sisera with the sheriff and mister camp i then walked over to the saloon where judge wilson was waiting to dispose of my case,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9400,6454-93938-0004,and answered that i asked an adjournment of the case so that i might be heard by counsel it was denied as was to have been expected indeed why they took the trouble to go through the forms was beyond me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9401,6454-93938-0005,i told wilson i should not produce the letters and he asked if i knew what that meant i couldn't help laughing and retorting it very appropriately means contempt of the court your honor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9402,6454-93938-0006,seeing that i understood the moves too well to be bluffed the judge mister camp and the lawyer held a whispered consultation my surprise can be imagined when at its conclusion mister camp said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9403,6454-93938-0007,on the night of october fourteenth and ask that he be taken into custody on that charge i couldn't make out this new move and puzzled over it while judge wilson ordered my commitment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9404,6454-93938-0008,but the next step revealed the object for the lawyer then asked for a search warrant to look for stolen property the judge was equally obliging and began to fill one out on the instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9405,6454-93938-0009,this made me feel pretty serious for the letters were in my breast pocket and i swore at my own stupidity in not having put them in the station safe when i had first arrived at ash forks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9406,6454-93938-0010,there weren't many moments in which to think while the judge scribbled away at the warrant but in what time there was i did a lot of head work without however finding more than one way out of the snarl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9407,6454-93938-0011,and when i saw the judge finish off his signature with a flourish i played a pretty desperate card you're just too late gentlemen i said pointing out the side window of the saloon there come the cavalry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9408,6454-93938-0012,the three conspirators jumped to their feet and bolted for the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9409,6454-93938-0013,as he did so i gave him a shove towards the three which sent them all sprawling on the floor in a pretty badly mixed up condition i made a dash for the door and as i went through it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9410,6454-93938-0014,i grabbed the key and locked them in when i turned to do so i saw the lot struggling up from the floor and knowing that it wouldn't take them many seconds to find their way out through the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9411,6454-93938-0015,as only western horses will stand it didn't take me long to have those bridles back in place and as i tossed each over the peak of the mexican saddle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9412,6454-93938-0016,i gave two of the ponies slaps which started them off at a lope across the railroad tracks i swung myself into the saddle of the third and flicked him with the loose ends of the bridle in a way which made him understand that i meant business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9413,6454-93938-0017,and considering that he had covered over forty miles that afternoon in pretty quick time it was not surprising that there wasn't very much go left in him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9414,6454-93938-0018,two hundred feet therefore brought me to the edge of the town and i wheeled my pony and rode down behind the rear of the buildings in turning i looked back and saw half a dozen mounted men already in pursuit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9415,6454-93938-0019,but i lost sight of them the next moment as soon as i reached a street leading back to the railroad i turned again and rode towards it my one thought being to get back if possible to the station,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9416,6454-93938-0020,and put the letters into the railroad agent's safe when i reached the main street i saw that my hope was futile for another batch of cowboys were coming in full gallop towards me very thoroughly heading me off in that direction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9417,6454-93938-0021,to escape them i headed up the street away from the station with the pack in close pursuit they yelled at me to hold up and i expected every moment to hear the crack of revolvers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9418,6454-93938-0022,in expectation of hearing the shooting begin and to know that any moment may be your last i don't suppose i was on the ragged edge more than thirty seconds but they were enough to prove to me that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9419,6454-93938-0023,to keep one's back turned to an enemy as one runs away takes a deal more pluck than to stand up and face his gun fortunately for me my pursuers felt so sure of my capture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9420,6454-93938-0024,that not one of them drew a bead on me the moment i saw that there was no escape i put my hand in my breast pocket and took out the letters intending to tear them into a hundred pieces but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9421,6454-93938-0025,as i did so i realized that to destroy united states mail not merely entailed criminal liability but was off color morally i faltered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9422,6454-93938-0026,balancing the outwitting of camp against state's prison the doing my best for madge against the wrong of it i think i'm as honest a fellow as the average but i have to confess that i couldn't decide to do right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9423,6454-93938-0027,till i thought that madge wouldn't want me to be dishonest even for her i turned across the railroad tracks and cut in behind some freight cars that were standing on a siding,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9424,6454-93938-0028,this put me out of view of my pursuers for a moment and in that instant i stood up in my stirrups lifted the broad leather flap of the saddle and tucked the letters underneath it as far in as i could force them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9425,6454-93938-0029,it was a desperate place in which to hide them but the game was a desperate one at best and the very boldness of the idea might be its best chance of success,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9426,6454-93938-0030,i was now heading for the station over the ties and was surprised to see fred cullen with lord ralles on the tracks up by the special for my mind had been so busy in the last hour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9427,6454-93938-0031,that i had forgotten that fred was due the moment i saw him i rode towards him pressing my pony for all he was worth my hope was that i might get time to give fred the tip as to where the letters were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9428,6454-93938-0032,but before i was within speaking distance baldwin came running out from behind the station and seeing me turned called back and gesticulated evidently to summon some cowboys to head me off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9429,6454-93938-0033,afraid to shout anything which should convey the slightest clue as to the whereabouts of the letters as the next best thing i pulled a couple of old section reports from my pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9430,6454-93938-0034,intending to ride up and run into my car for i knew that the papers in my hand would be taken to be the wanted letters and that if i could only get inside the car even for a moment the suspicion would be that i had been able to hide them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9431,6454-93938-0035,hide them fred was quick as a flash and grabbing them off the ground sprang up the steps of my car and ran inside just escaping a bullet from my pursuers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9432,5339-14133-0000,black and bitter but welcome enough to the farmers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9433,5339-14133-0001,and bell robson though not getting worse did not make any progress towards amendment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9434,5339-14133-0002,or washing or churning days her life was quiet and monotonous although hard working and while her hands mechanically found and did their accustomed labour the thoughts that rose in her head always centred on charley kinraid his ways his words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9435,5339-14133-0003,like nancy and borrowing the poor girl's own words she would say softly to herself he once was here but all along she believed in her heart he would come back again to her though it touched her strangely to imagine the agonies of forsaken love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9436,5339-14133-0004,he was very busy with facts and figures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9437,5339-14133-0005,and to see sylvia for the two fosters were punctiliously anxious to make their shopmen test all their statements insisting on an examination of the stock as if hepburn and coulson were strangers to the shop,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9438,5339-14133-0006,by degrees both hepburn and coulson were introduced to distant manufacturers and wholesale dealers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9439,5339-14133-0007,but this it was evident would not have satisfied their masters who were scrupulous in insisting that whatever advantage there was should always fall on the side of the younger men when philip saw sylvia she was always quiet and gentle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9440,5339-14133-0008,perhaps more silent than she had been a year ago and she did not attend so briskly to what was passing around her she was rather thinner and paler but whatever change there was in her was always an improvement in philip's eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9441,5339-14133-0009,so long as she spoke graciously to him he thought she was suffering from long continued anxiety about her mother or that she had too much to do and either cause was enough to make him treat her with a grave regard and deference which had a repressed tenderness in it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9442,5339-14133-0010,of which she otherwise occupied was quite unaware she liked him better too than she had done a year or two before because he did not show her any of the eager attention which teased her then although its meaning was not fully understood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9443,5339-14133-0011,things were much in this state when the frost broke and milder weather succeeded this was the time so long looked forward to by the invalid and her friends as favouring the doctor's recommendation of change of air her husband was to take her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9444,5339-14133-0012,to spend a fortnight with a kindly neighbour who lived near the farm they had occupied forty miles or so inland before they came to haytersbank the widow woman was to come and stay in the house to keep sylvia company during her mother's absence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9445,5339-14133-0013,daniel indeed was to return home after conveying his wife to her destination but there was so much to be done on the land at this time of the year that sylvia would have been alone all day had it not been for the arrangement just mentioned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9446,5339-14133-0014,and yet these must be reached before june or the year's expedition would be of little avail every blacksmith's shop rung with the rhythmical clang of busy hammers beating out old iron such as horseshoes nails or stubs into the great harpoons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9447,5339-14133-0015,conscious of the demand in which they were held at this season of the year it was war time too many captains unable to procure men in monkshaven would have to complete their crews in the shetlands the shops in the town were equally busy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9448,5339-14133-0016,stores had to be purchased by the whaling masters warm clothing of all sorts to be provided these were the larger wholesale orders but many a man and woman too brought out their small hoards to purchase extra comforts or precious keepsakes for some beloved one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9449,5339-14133-0017,it was the time of the great half yearly traffic of the place another impetus was given to business when the whalers returned in the autumn and the men were flush of money and full of delight at once more seeing their homes and their friends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9450,5339-14133-0018,there was much to be done in fosters shop and later hours were kept than usual some perplexity or other was occupying john and jeremiah foster,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9451,5339-14133-0019,but it thus happened that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render at such times and coulson had been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and philip as future partners,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9452,5339-14133-0020,one evening after the shop was closed while they were examining the goods and comparing the sales with the entries in the day book coulson suddenly inquired by the way hester does thee know where the parcel of best bandanas is gone there was four left as i'm pretty sure when i set off to sandsend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9453,5339-14133-0021,is he here again said philip i didn't see him what brings him here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9454,5339-14133-0022,i wish i'd seen him said coulson,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9455,5339-14133-0023,why what's up said philip surprised at william's unusual manner and at the same time rather gratified to find a reflection of his own feelings about kinraid coulson's face was pale with anger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9456,5339-14133-0024,and then my master saw another girl that he liked better' william almost choked in his endeavour to keep down all appearance of violent anger and then went on and that he played t same game wi as i've heerd tell and how did thy sister take it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9457,5339-14133-0025,she died in a six month said william she forgived him but it's beyond me i thought it were him when i heerd of t work about darley kinraid and coming fra newcassel where annie lived prentice and i made inquiry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9458,5339-14133-0026,this fault of his was one with which the two grave sedate young men had no sympathy their hearts were true and constant whatever else might be their failings and it is no new thing to damn the faults we have no mind to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9459,5339-14133-0027,he had only come that afternoon to monkshaven and for the sole purpose of seeing sylvia once more before he went to fulfil his engagement as specksioneer in the urania a whaling vessel that was to sail from north shields on thursday morning and this was monday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9460,5339-14133-0028,sylvia sat in the house place her back to the long low window in order to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her work a basket of her father's unmended stockings was on the little round table beside her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9461,5339-14133-0029,and one was on her left hand which she supposed herself to be mending but from time to time she made long pauses and looked in the fire and yet there was but little motion of flame or light in it out of which to conjure visions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9462,5339-14133-0030,it was redd up for the afternoon covered with a black mass of coal over which the equally black kettle hung on the crook in the back kitchen dolly reid sylvia's assistant during her mother's absence chanted a lugubrious ditty befitting her condition as a widow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9463,5339-14133-0031,charley kinraid and the story of crazy nancy had been the subjects for her dreams for many a day and many a night now he stood there bright and handsome as ever with just that much timidity in his face that anxiety as to his welcome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9464,5339-14133-0032,she did not come forward to meet him she went crimson to the very roots of her hair but that in the waning light he could not see and she shook so that she felt as if she could hardly stand but the tremor was not visible to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9465,5339-14133-0033,the tones the looks that had accompanied those words but all she said was i didn't think to see yo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9466,5339-14133-0034,she felt his eyes were upon her watching every motion and grew more and more confused in her expression and behaviour he was a little taken aback by the nature of his reception and was not sure at first whether to take the great change in her manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9467,5339-14133-0035,as a favourable symptom or otherwise by and by luckily for him in some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table she caught the edge of her work basket and down it fell she stooped to pick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9468,5339-14133-0036,and so did he and when they rose up he had fast hold of her hand and her face was turned away half ready to cry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9469,5339-14133-0037,yo might ha forgotten me and yet i thought we made a bargain against forgetting each other no answer he went on yo've never been out o my thoughts sylvia robson,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9470,5339-14133-0038,and i've been near neither kith nor kin as yet and now i'm here you won't speak to me i don't know what to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9471,5339-14133-0039,till i'd taught her to love me more but if she's a cold heart and cannot care for a honest sailor why then i'd best go back at once he made for the door he must have been pretty sure from some sign or other or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to give way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9472,5339-14133-0040,he had not taken two steps when she turned quickly towards him and said something,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9473,5339-14133-0041,and then they sat down on the settle together and when she was more composed they began to talk he asked her about her mother not sorry in his heart at bell robson's absence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9474,5339-14133-0042,he had intended if necessary to acknowledge his wishes and desires with regard to sylvia to her parents but for various reasons he was not sorry that circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9475,5339-14133-0043,had given him the chance of seeing her alone and obtaining her promise to marry him without being obliged to tell either her father or her mother at present i ha spent my money pretty free he said and i've ne'er a penny to the fore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9476,5339-14133-0044,and yo'r parents may look for something better for yo my pretty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9477,5339-14133-0045,i shall go to sea happy now thinking i've yo'r word yo're not one to go back from it i'm sure else it's a long time to leave such a pretty girl as yo and ne'er a chance of a letter reaching yo just to tell yo once again how i love yo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9478,5339-14133-0046,there'll be no need o that murmured sylvia she was too dizzy with happiness to have attended much to his details of his worldly prospects but at the sound of his tender words of love her eager heart was ready to listen i don't know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9479,5339-14133-0047,and there's yon tall fellow of a cousin as looks black at me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9480,5339-14133-0048,he's a notion of being sweet on yo hisself not he said sylvia with some contempt in her tone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9481,5339-14133-0049,but she weary of a subject she cared nothing about and eager to identify herself with all his interests asked him about his plans almost at the same time that he said these last words and they went on as lovers do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9482,5339-14133-0050,at any rate it was not unwelcome he liked kinraid and had strong sympathy not merely with what he knew of the young sailor's character but with the life he led and the business he followed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9483,5339-14133-0051,robson listened to all he said with approving nods and winks till charley had told him everything he had to say and then he turned and struck his broad horny palm into kinraid's as if concluding a bargain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9484,5339-14133-0052,he wound up with a chuckle as the thought struck him that this great piece of business of disposing of their only child had been concluded while his wife was away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9485,5339-14133-0053,mischief only knows but she's noan keen on matterimony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9486,5339-14133-0054,we'n best keep this matter to ourselves till thou comes int port again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9487,5339-14133-0055,an oud man like me isn't as good company as a pretty lass laughing a low rich laugh over his own wit daniel went to the bottom of the stairs and called sylvie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9488,5339-14133-0056,for a time there was no answer then a door was unbolted and sylvia said i can't come down again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9489,5339-14134-0000,of the number of letters that arrived in monkshaven the fosters shopkeepers and bankers had the largest share the morning succeeding the day on which sylvia had engaged herself to kinraid the fosters seemed unusually anxious to obtain their letters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9490,5339-14134-0001,several times jeremiah came out of the parlour in which his brother john was sitting in expectant silence and passing through the shop looked up and down the market place in search of the old lame woman who was charitably employed to deliver letters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9491,5339-14134-0002,and who must have been lamer than ever this morning to judge from the lateness of her coming although none but the fosters knew the cause of their impatience for their letters yet there was such tacit sympathy between them and those whom they employed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9492,5339-14134-0003,with her basket of letters one of these seemed of especial consequence to the good brothers they each separately looked at the direction and then at one another and without a word they returned with it unread into the parlour shutting the door and drawing the green silk curtain close the better to read it in privacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9493,5339-14134-0004,and were perhaps as full of consideration as to the possible contents of this london letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9494,5339-14134-0005,a minute ago philip and he were on a level of ignorance from which the former was evidently going to be raised but he soon returned to his usual state of acquiescence in things as they were which was partly constitutional and partly the result of his quaker training,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9495,5339-14134-0006,it was apparently by john foster's wish that philip had been summoned jeremiah the less energetic and decided brother was still discussing the propriety of the step when philip entered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9496,5339-14134-0007,that the fosters had for some time received anonymous letters warning them with distinct meaning though in ambiguous terms against a certain silk manufacturer in spitalfields with whom they had had straightforward business dealings for many years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9497,5339-14134-0008,but to whom they had latterly advanced money the letters hinted at the utter insolvency of this manufacturer they had urged their correspondent to give them his name in confidence and this morning's letter had brought it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9498,5339-14134-0009,but the name was totally unknown to them though there seemed no reason to doubt the reality of either it or the address the latter of which was given in full,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9499,5339-14134-0010,and was publicly distinguished for his excellent and philanthropic character but these letters were provocative of anxiety especially since this morning's post had brought out the writer's full name and various particulars showing his intimate knowledge of dickinson's affairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9500,5339-14134-0011,after much perplexed consultation john had hit upon the plan of sending hepburn to london to make secret inquiries respecting the true character and commercial position of the man whose creditors not a month ago they had esteemed it an honour to be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9501,5339-14134-0012,even now jeremiah was ashamed of their want of confidence in one so good he believed that the information they had received would all prove a mistake founded on erroneous grounds if not a pure invention of an enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9502,5339-14134-0013,and he had only been brought partially to consent to the sending of hepburn by his brother's pledging himself that the real nature of philip's errand should be unknown to any human creature save them three as all this was being revealed to philip he sat apparently unmoved and simply attentive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9503,5339-14134-0014,in fact he was giving all his mind to understanding the probabilities of the case leaving his own feelings in the background till his intellect should have done its work he said little but what he did say was to the point and satisfied both brothers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9504,5339-14134-0015,john perceived that his messenger would exercise penetration and act with energy while jeremiah was soothed by philip's caution in not hastily admitting the probability of any charge against dickinson and in giving full weight to his previous good conduct and good character,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9505,5339-14134-0016,philip had the satisfaction of feeling himself employed on a mission which would call out his powers and yet not exceed them in his own mind he forestalled the instructions of his masters and was silently in advance of john foster's plans and arrangements,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9506,5339-14134-0017,while he appeared to listen to all that was said with quiet business like attention it was settled that the next morning he was to make his way northwards to hartlepool whence he could easily proceed either by land or sea to newcastle from which place smacks were constantly sailing to london,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9507,5339-14134-0018,saying it was more than he should require but they repeated with fresh urgency their warnings about the terrible high prices of london till he could only resolve to keep a strict account and bring back all that he did not expend since nothing but his taking the whole sum would satisfy his employers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9508,5339-14134-0019,the latter was silent brooding over the confidence which philip had apparently received but which was withheld from him he did not yet know of the culminating point of philip's proposed journey to london,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9509,5339-14134-0020,that great city of london which from its very inaccessibility fifty years ago loomed so magnificent through the mist of men's imaginations it is not to be denied that philip felt exultant at the mere fact of going to london but then again the thought of leaving sylvia,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9510,5339-14134-0021,of not seeing her for a week a fortnight nay he might be away for a month for no rash hurry was to mar his delicate negotiation gnawed at his heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9511,5339-14134-0022,several times that day as he perceived coulson's jealous sullenness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9512,5339-14134-0023,as they all sat at tea in alice rose's house place philip announced his intended journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9513,5339-14134-0024,to lunnon exclaimed alice hester said nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9514,5339-14134-0025,said coulson luck said alice turning sharp round on him niver let me hear such a vain word out o thy mouth laddie again it's the lord's doing and luck's the devil's way o putting it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9515,5339-14134-0026,niver fret thyself mother about t shirt said philip if i need a shirt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9516,5339-14134-0027,but if that's the frame o mind thou'rt in lunnon is like for to be a sore place o temptation there's pitfalls for men and traps for money at ivery turn as i've heerd say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9517,5339-14134-0028,said coulson he's sent for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9518,5339-14134-0029,philip knows said hester and then somehow her voice failed her and she stopped philip paid no attention to this half uttered sentence he was eager to tell coulson as far as he could do so without betraying his master's secret how many drawbacks there were to his proposed journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9519,5339-14134-0030,in the responsibility which it involved and his unwillingness to leave monkshaven he said coulson i'd give a deal it were thou that were going and not me at least there is many a time i'd give a deal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9520,5339-14134-0031,i'll not deny but at other times i'm pleased at the thought on't but if i could i'd change places wi thee at this moment it's fine talking said coulson half mollified and yet not caring to show it i make no doubt it were an even chance betwixt us two at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9521,5339-14134-0032,she was playing with her teaspoon but he could see that she was choking down her tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9522,5339-14134-0033,what's to do hester said he she lifted up those eyes usually so soft and serene now they were full of the light of indignation shining through tears to do she said coulson i'd thought better of thee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9523,5339-14134-0034,going and doubting and envying philip as niver did thee an ill turn or said an ill word or thought an ill thought by thee and sending him away out o t house this last night of all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9524,5339-14134-0035,she hastily got up and left the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9525,5339-14134-0036,and yet he was reproached for the course it was taking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9526,5339-14134-0037,and till he had patiently with long continuing and deep affection worked his way into her regard was set aside during the present walk he would speak to her of his passionate attachment before he left for an uncertain length of time and the certain distance of london,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9527,5339-14134-0038,and all the modification on this point which his judgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart was that he would watch her words and manner well when he announced his approaching absence and if in them he read the slightest token of tender regretful feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9528,5339-14134-0039,he would pour out his love at her feet not even urging the young girl to make any return or to express the feelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her he would be patient with her he could not be patient himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9529,5339-14134-0040,they had seen him already or his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid them even though one of his purposes in going to haytersbank had been to bid his uncle farewell kinraid took him by surprise from the hearty greeting he gave him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9530,5339-14134-0041,and convinced of her great love towards himself had forgotten any previous jealousy of philip secure and exultant his broad handsome weather bronzed face was as great a contrast to philip's long thoughtful sallow countenance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9531,5339-14134-0042,he told his uncle that he was bound for london the next day on business connected with the fosters daniel was deeply struck with the fact that he was talking to a man setting off for london at a day's notice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9533,5339-14134-0044,no i shan't he replied shortly liking has nought to do with it ah yo knew nought about it last neet continued daniel musingly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9534,5339-14134-0045,before going to sea said philip half smiling na,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9535,5339-14134-0046,though our ship lay a fortneet off gravesend kinraid now seemed in a hurry but philip was stung with curiosity to ascertain his movements and suddenly addressed him i heard yo were these parts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9536,5339-14134-0047,and sail for the north seas day after he turned away and began to whistle as if he did not wish for any further conversation with his interrogator philip indeed had nothing more to say to him he had learned all he wanted to know i'd like to bid good by to sylvie is she at home he asked of her father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9537,5339-14134-0048,so they parted but philip had not gone many steps before his uncle called him back kinraid slowly loitering on meanwhile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9625,4340-15220-0056,and we don't want to walk fast ben spoke very decidedly and taking billy's arm away they went leaving poor bab and sanch to watch them out of sight one sobbing the other whining dismally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9626,4340-15220-0057,somehow those two figures seemed to go before ben all along the pleasant road and half spoilt his fun for though he laughed and talked cut canes and seemed as merry as a grig,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9627,4340-15220-0058,he could not help feeling that he ought to have asked leave to go and been kinder to bab,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9629,4340-15220-0060,and planning to do the honors handsomely to the boys it was very warm and just outside of the town they paused by a wayside watering trough to wash their dusty faces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9630,4340-15220-0061,and cool off before plunging into the excitements of the afternoon as they stood refreshing themselves a baker's cart came jingling by and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested a supply of gingerbread was soon bought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9631,4340-15220-0062,and climbing the green bank above they lay on the grass under a wild cherry tree munching luxuriously while they feasted their eyes at the same time on the splendors awaiting them for the great tent with all its flags flying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9634,4340-15220-0065,which hid the king of beasts from his longing sight that was a cow mooing don't you be a donkey bill when you hear a real roar you'll shake in your boots said ben holding up his handkerchief to dry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9635,4340-15220-0066,i wish you'd hurry up sam folks are going in now i see em and billy pranced with impatience for this was his first circus and he firmly believed that he was going to behold all that the pictures promised,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9636,4340-15220-0067,hold on a minute while i get one more drink buns are dry fodder said sam rolling over to the edge of the bank and preparing to descend with as little trouble as possible he nearly went down head first however for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9637,4340-15220-0068,as he looked before he leaped he beheld a sight which caused him to stare with all his might for an instant then turn and beckon saying in an eager whisper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9638,4340-15220-0069,and both suppressed an astonished hullo for there stood bab waiting for sancho to lap his fill out of the overflowing trough such a shabby tired looking couple as they were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9639,4340-15220-0070,bab with a face as red as a lobster and streaked with tears shoes white with dust playfrock torn at the gathers something bundled up in her apron and one shoe down at the heel as if it hurt her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9640,4340-15220-0071,sancho lapped eagerly with his eyes shut all his ruffles were gray with dust and his tail hung wearily down the tassel at half mast as if in mourning for the master whom he had come to find,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9641,4340-15220-0072,bab still held the strap intent on keeping her charge safe though she lost herself but her courage seemed to be giving out as she looked anxiously up and down the road,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9642,4340-15220-0073,seeing no sign of the three familiar figures she had been following as steadily as a little indian on the war trail oh sanch what shall i do if they don't come along we must have gone by them somewhere for i don't see any one that way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9643,4340-15220-0074,and there isn't any other road to the circus seems to me bab spoke as if the dog could understand and answer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9644,4340-15220-0075,and fixing his sharp eyes on the grass above him gave a suspicious bark it's only squirrels don't mind but come along and be good for i m so tired i don't know what to do sighed bab,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9645,4340-15220-0076,trying to pull him after her as she trudged on bound to see the outside of that wonderful tent even if she never got in but sancho had heard a soft chirrup and with a sudden bound twitched the strap away sprang up the bank,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9646,4340-15220-0077,and landed directly on ben's back as he lay peeping over a peal of laughter greeted him and having got the better of his master in more ways than one he made the most of the advantage by playfully worrying him as he kept him down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9647,4340-15220-0078,licking his face in spite of his struggles burrowing in his neck with a ticklish nose snapping at his buttons and yelping joyfully as if it was the best joke in the world to play hide and seek for four long miles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9648,4340-15220-0079,before ben could quiet him bab came climbing up the bank with such a funny mixture of fear fatigue determination and relief in her dirty little face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9649,4340-15220-0080,that the boys could not look awful if they tried how dared you come after us miss demanded sam as she looked calmly about her and took a seat before she was asked sanch would come after ben,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9650,4340-15220-0081,i couldn't make him go home so i had to hold on till he was safe here else he'd be lost and then ben would feel bad the cleverness of that excuse tickled the boys immensely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9651,4340-15220-0082,and sam tried again while ben was getting the dog down and sitting on him now you expect to go to the circus i suppose course i do ben said he didn't mind paying if i could get there without bothering him and i have,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9652,4340-15220-0083,and i'll go home alone i ain't afraid sanch will take care of me if you won't answered bab stoutly what do you suppose your mother will say to you asked ben feeling much reproached by her last words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9653,4340-15220-0084,i guess she'll say you led me into mischief and the sharp child nodded as if she defied him to deny the truth of that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9654,4340-15220-0085,advised sam thinking bab great fun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9655,4340-15220-0086,what would you have done if you hadn't found us asked billy forgetting his impatience in his admiration for this plucky young lady i'd have gone on and seen the circus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9656,4340-15220-0087,was the prompt answer but you haven't any money oh i'd ask somebody to pay for me i m so little it wouldn't be much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9657,4340-15220-0088,i thought of that and planned how i'd fix it if i didn't find ben i'd make sanch do his tricks and get a quarter that way so now answered bab undaunted by any obstacle i do believe she would,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9658,4340-15220-0089,you are a smart child bab and if i had enough i'd take you in myself said billy heartily for having sisters of his own he kept a soft place in his heart for girls especially enterprising ones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9659,4340-15220-0090,i'll take care of her it was very naughty to come bab but so long as you did you needn't worry about any thing i'll see to you and you shall have a real good time said ben accepting his responsibilities without a murmur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9660,4340-15220-0091,and bound to do the handsome thing by his persistent friend i thought you would and bab folded her arms as if she had nothing further to do but enjoy herself are you hungry asked billy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9661,4340-15220-0092,fishing out several fragments of gingerbread starving and bab ate them with such a relish that sam added a small contribution and ben caught some water for her in his hand where the little spring bubbled up beside a stone now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9662,4340-15220-0093,commanded ben giving sanch a roll on the grass to clean him bab scrubbed her face till it shone and pulling down her apron to wipe it scattered a load of treasures collected in her walk some of the dead flowers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9663,4340-15220-0094,bits of moss and green twigs fell near ben and one attracted his attention a spray of broad smooth leaves with a bunch of whitish berries on it where did you get that he asked poking it with his foot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9664,4340-15220-0095,in a swampy place coming along sanch saw something down there and i went with him cause i thought may be it was a musk rat and you'd like one if we could get him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9665,4340-15220-0096,and with intense interest no only a snake and i don't care for snakes i picked some of that it was so green and pretty thorny likes queer leaves and berries you know answered bab spatting down her rough locks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9666,4340-15220-0097,well he won't like that nor you either,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9667,4340-15220-0098,and i shouldn't wonder if you'd got poisoned bab don't touch it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9668,4340-15220-0099,and ben looked anxiously at bab who felt her chubby face all over and examined her dingy hands with a solemn air asking eagerly will it break out on me fore i get to the circus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9669,4340-15220-0100,not for a day or so i guess but it's bad when it does come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9670,198-129977-0000,elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9671,198-129977-0001,while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9672,198-129977-0002,but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9673,198-129977-0003,he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9674,198-129977-0004,as you are not yet ready for breakfast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9675,198-129977-0005,this was a subject which ensured marianne's attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9676,198-129977-0006,when edward interrupted her by saying you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9677,198-129977-0007,which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9678,198-129977-0008,the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9679,198-129977-0009,i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9680,198-129977-0010,i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9681,198-129977-0011,and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9682,198-129977-0012,is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9683,198-129977-0013,because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9684,198-129977-0014,but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9685,198-129977-0015,i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9686,198-129977-0016,marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9687,198-129977-0017,till a new object suddenly engaged her attention she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from missus dashwood his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9688,198-129977-0018,but i should have thought her hair had been darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9689,198-129977-0019,he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister's hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9690,198-129977-0020,that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9691,198-129977-0021,she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9692,198-129977-0022,that it was exactly the shade of her own edward's embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9693,198-129977-0023,before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and missus jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest with the assistance of his mother in law sir john was not long in discovering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9694,198-129977-0024,that the name of ferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9695,198-129977-0025,but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret's instructions extended sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9696,198-129977-0026,on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both you must drink tea with us to night said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9697,198-129977-0027,missus jennings enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she and that will tempt you miss marianne a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9698,198-129977-0028,what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again this and marianne's blushing gave new suspicions to edward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9699,198-129977-0029,and who is willoughby said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting she gave him a brief reply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9700,198-129977-0030,edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9701,198-129977-0031,what do you mean shall i tell you certainly well then i guess that mister willoughby hunts marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment's silence said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9702,198-129977-0032,hope i am sure you will like him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9703,198-209-0000,missus allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9704,198-209-0001,catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilney's lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9705,198-209-0002,and missus allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful to milsom street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9706,198-209-0003,tripping lightly through the church yard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9707,198-209-0004,and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home and too much offended to admit her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9708,198-209-0005,and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9709,198-209-0006,at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgar's buildings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9710,198-209-0007,catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9711,198-209-0008,to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9712,198-209-0009,for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9713,198-209-0010,to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared to plague or please her she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9714,198-209-0011,on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mister henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9715,198-209-0012,every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9716,198-209-0013,his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9717,198-209-0014,and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9718,198-209-0015,to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9719,198-209-0016,or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat but his father remained,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9720,198-209-0017,and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9721,198-209-0018,you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it missus allen did not they tell me that mister tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9722,198-209-0019,my dear you tumble my gown was missus allen's reply her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9723,198-209-0020,and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9724,198-209-0021,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mister thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now missus allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mister thorpe would only have stopped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9725,198-209-0022,i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sister's concern regret,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9726,198-209-0023,and dependence on catherine's honour oh do not say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9727,198-209-0024,perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9728,198-209-0025,and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9729,198-209-0026,and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mister tilney,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9730,198-209-0027,why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence me i take offence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9731,198-209-0028,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9732,198-209-0029,and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9733,198-209-0030,she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9734,198-209-0031,was engaged in conversation with general tilney,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9735,198-209-0032,what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mister thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9736,198-209-0033,as she pointed them out to her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9737,198-209-0034,when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9738,198-209-0035,in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with general tilney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9739,198-209-0036,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9740,198-209-0037,the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9741,198-209-0038,lowering his voice well done general said i i am quite of your mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9742,198-126831-0000,friday was a comfortable day in the household of king everybody was in good humour the story girl sparkled through several tales that ranged from the afrites and jinns of eastern myth through the piping days of chivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlisle workaday folks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9743,198-126831-0001,she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silken veil the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of palestine disguised as a page the gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a coranto,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9744,198-126831-0002,with a highwayman on a moonlit heath and buskirk's girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9745,198-126831-0003,cecily and sara ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9746,198-126831-0004,chancing accidentally i vow to overhear certain of these secrets i learned that sara ray had named an apple for johnny price and cecily true's you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9747,198-126831-0005,while cecily admitted that willy fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her if you love me as i love you no knife can cut our love in two but sara ray never you breathe this to a living soul,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9748,198-126831-0006,cecily how old must we be before we can have a real beau but sara always denied it so i am inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself paddy distinguished himself by catching a rat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9749,198-126831-0007,and being intolerably conceited about it until sara ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears then pat sneaked abjectly off his tail drooping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9750,198-126831-0008,very few cats have and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon paddy had a finer taste the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9751,198-126831-0009,the story girl would box his ears with her fist and say bless your gray heart paddy you're a good sort of old rascal and pat would purr his satisfaction i used to take a handful of the skin on his back shake him gently and say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9752,198-126831-0010,pat you've forgotten more than any human being ever knew and i vow paddy would lick his chops with delight but to be called a sweet cat oh sara sara,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9753,198-126831-0011,felicity tried and had the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe a gorgeous compound,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9754,198-126831-0012,the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked aunt janet's thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse uncle roger ate three slices of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9755,198-126831-0013,the poor man meant it as a compliment but felicity who knew uncle blair was an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasn't,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9756,198-126831-0014,i'd like to sighed felicity but we'd come home tired and with all the milking to do you boys better go alone peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger you can all go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9757,198-126831-0015,i have an idea that a raspberry pie for to morrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9758,198-126831-0016,a pretty walk through a world of green whispering boughs and spice sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight the raspberries were plentiful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9759,198-126831-0017,then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies and the story girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glen where a fair white lady dwelt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9760,198-126831-0018,who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright and if you drank of the cup with her said the story girl her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us you were never seen in the world again you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with a fairy bride,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9761,198-126831-0019,i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward said the story girl dreamily and i think there is a way of getting there too if we could only find it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9762,198-126831-0020,one bitter day when they seek it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9763,198-126831-0021,and that is the tragedy of life on that day the gates of eden are shut behind them and the age of gold is over henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9764,198-126831-0022,they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles the world calls them its singers and poets and artists and story tellers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9765,198-126831-0023,as we sat there the awkward man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side he did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9766,198-126831-0024,he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed the story girl kissed her fingertips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9767,198-126831-0025,you'd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him they say it's pitiful to see him i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9768,198-126831-0026,if i put it off any longer it will be too late i'm growing so fast aunt olivia says i'll have to wear ankle skirts next summer if i begin to look grown up he'll get frightened of me and then i'll never find out the golden milestone mystery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9769,198-126831-0027,do you think he'll ever tell you who alice is i asked i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature but she would tell us nothing more when the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9770,198-126831-0028,and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights off to the west was a daffodil glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9771,198-126831-0029,and i got back about fifteen minutes ago i set down on the front door steps for a moment and all at once i heard a bell ring in the house eight times i tell you i was skeered i made a bolt for the orchard and you won't catch me going near that house till your uncle roger comes home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9772,198-126831-0030,there we stood in a huddled demoralized group oh what an eerie place that orchard was what shadows what noises,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9773,198-126831-0031,well here's the key go and see for yourself said peter felicity had no intention of going and seeing i think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex you ought to be braver than girls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9774,198-126831-0032,somebody killed or something like that you know nothing like that ever happened in our family the kings have always been respectable perhaps it is emily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9775,198-126831-0033,king's ghost whispered felix she never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the story girl oh oh children isn't there something under uncle alec's tree we peered fearfully through the gloom there was something something that wavered and fluttered advanced retreated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9776,198-126831-0034,that's only my old apron said felicity i hung it there to day when i was looking for the white hen's nest oh what shall we do uncle roger may not be back for hours i can't believe there's anything in the house maybe it's only peg bowen suggested dan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9777,198-126831-0035,there was not a great deal of comfort in this we were almost as much afraid of peg bowen as we would be of any spectral visitant peter scoffed at the idea peg bowen wasn't in the house before your uncle roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9778,198-126831-0036,no it isn't peg bowen it's something that walks i know a story about a ghost said the story girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9779,198-126831-0037,don't cried cecily hysterically don't you go on don't you say another word i can't bear it don't you the story girl didn't but she had said enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9780,198-126831-0038,all at once something leaped from the bough of a tree and alighted before us we split the air with a simultaneous shriek,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9781,198-126831-0039,he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9782,198-126831-0040,he was a strange furtive animal a questing beast presently the moon rose but this only made matters worse the shadows had been still before now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs the old house with its dreadful secret,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9783,198-126831-0041,was white and clear against the dark background of spruces we were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew the family ghost only appears in daylight said the story girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9784,198-126831-0042,i know he'll laugh at us awful but it's better to be laughed at than scared like this uncle roger did not come until nearly ten never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in the lane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9785,198-126831-0043,we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door he stared at us in the moonlight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9786,198-126831-0044,there's no use asking the meaning of this i suppose said uncle roger with the calm of despair i've gave up trying to fathom you young ones peter where's the key what yarn have you been telling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9787,198-126831-0045,uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door as he did so clear and sweet rang out ten bell like chimes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9788,198-126831-0046,we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation we thought he never would stop,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9789,198-126831-0047,and now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9790,198-126831-0048,i was so frightened i wouldn't mind if he'd laugh once and have it done with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9791,198-126831-0049,i shall tell it too i don't care if the joke is as much on myself as any one a story is a story no matter who it's on but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown ups always do it i never will when i'm grown up i'll remember better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9792,198-126831-0050,it's all peter's fault said felicity i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9793,198-126831-0051,it don't sound a bit like other clocks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9794,198-126831-0052,i wouldn't have said the story girl honestly i thought it was a bell when i heard it and the door open too let us be fair felicity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9795,198-126831-0053,but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that a saucerful apiece,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9797,248-130652-0001,on the second day after the archery meeting mister henleigh mallinger grandcourt was at his breakfast table with mister lush everything around them was agreeable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9798,248-130652-0002,the still life in the room which seemed the stiller for its sober antiquated elegance as if it kept a conscious well bred silence unlike the restlessness of vulgar furniture whether the gentlemen were agreeable to each other was less evident,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9799,248-130652-0003,mister grandcourt had drawn his chair aside so as to face the lawn and with his left leg over another chair and his right elbow on the table was smoking a large cigar while his companion was still eating the dogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9800,248-130652-0004,gave a vacillating preference first to one gentleman then to the other being dogs in such good circumstances that they could play at hunger and liked to be served with delicacies which they declined to put in their mouths all except fetch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9801,248-130652-0005,the beautiful liver colored water spaniel which sat with its forepaws firmly planted and its expressive brown face turned upward watching grandcourt with unshaken constancy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9802,248-130652-0006,he held in his lap a tiny maltese dog with a tiny silver collar and bell and when he had a hand unused by cigar or coffee cup it rested on this small parcel of animal warmth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9803,248-130652-0007,grandcourt looked at her with unchanged face for half a minute and then took the trouble to lay down his cigar while he lifted the unimpassioned fluff close to his chin and gave it caressing pats all the while gravely watching fetch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9804,248-130652-0008,who poor thing whimpered interruptedly as if trying to repress that sign of discontent and at last rested her head beside the appealing paw looking up with piteous beseeching so at least a lover of dogs must have interpreted fetch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9805,248-130652-0009,and grandcourt kept so many dogs that he was reputed to love them at any rate his impulse to act just in that way started from such an interpretation but when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling bark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9806,248-130652-0010,that the brute of a cigar required relighting fetch having begun to wail found like others of her sex that it was not easy to leave off indeed the second howl was a louder one and the third was like unto it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9807,248-130652-0011,turn out that brute will you said grandcourt to lush without raising his voice or looking at him as if he counted on attention to the smallest sign and lush immediately rose lifted fetch though she was rather heavy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9808,248-130652-0012,shall you ride or drive to quetcham to day i am not going to quetcham you did not go yesterday grandcourt smoked in silence for half a minute and then said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9809,248-130652-0013,i suppose you sent my card and inquiries i went myself at four and said you were sure to be there shortly they would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the intention especially if you go to day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9810,248-130652-0014,silence for a couple of minutes then grandcourt said what men are invited here with their wives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9811,248-130652-0015,then there are mister hollis and lady flora and the cushats and the gogoffs rather a ragged lot remarked grandcourt after a while why did you ask the gogoffs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9812,248-130652-0016,grandcourt like many others had two remarkably different voices hitherto we have heard him speaking in a superficial interrupted drawl suggestive chiefly of languor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9813,248-130652-0017,and one of your damned musicians but not a comic fellow i wonder if klesmer would consent to come to us when he leaves quetcham nothing but first class music will go down with miss arrowpoint,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9814,248-130652-0018,lush spoke carelessly but he was really seizing an opportunity and fixing an observant look on grandcourt who now for the first time turned his eyes toward his companion but slowly and without speaking until he had given two long luxuriant puffs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9815,248-130652-0019,when he said perhaps in a lower tone than ever but with a perceptible edge of contempt what in the name of nonsense have i to do with miss arrowpoint and her music,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9816,248-130652-0020,you need not give yourself much trouble perhaps but some forms must be gone through before a man can marry a million very likely but i am not going to marry a million,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9817,248-130652-0021,that's a pity to fling away an opportunity of this sort and knock down your own plans your plans i suppose you mean you have some debts you know and things may turn out inconveniently after all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9818,248-130652-0022,and the daughter's looks and manners require no allowances any more than if she hadn't a sixpence she is not beautiful but equal to carrying any rank and she is not likely to refuse such prospects as you can offer her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9819,248-130652-0023,perhaps not the father and mother would let you do anything you like with them but i should not like to do anything with them here it was lush who made a little pause before speaking again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9820,248-130652-0024,and then he said in a deep voice of remonstrance good god grandcourt after your experience will you let a whim interfere with your comfortable settlement in life spare your oratory i know what i am going to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9821,248-130652-0025,what lush put down his cigar and thrust his hands into his side pockets as if he had to face something exasperating but meant to keep his temper i am going to marry the other girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9822,248-130652-0026,have you fallen in love this question carried a strong sneer i am going to marry her you have made her an offer already then no she is a young lady with a will of her own i fancy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9823,248-130652-0027,extremely well fitted to make a rumpus she would know what she liked she doesn't like you said grandcourt with the ghost of a smile perfectly true said lush adding again in a markedly sneering tone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9824,248-130652-0028,however if you and she are devoted to each other that will be enough grandcourt took no notice of this speech but sipped his coffee rose and strolled out on the lawn all the dogs following him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9825,248-130652-0029,lush glanced after him a moment then resumed his cigar and lit it but smoked slowly consulting his beard with inspecting eyes and fingers till he finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some conclusion and said in a subdued voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9826,248-130652-0030,check old boy lush being a man of some ability had not known grandcourt for fifteen years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him though what sort might be useful remained often dubious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9827,248-130652-0031,in the beginning of his career he held a fellowship and was near taking orders for the sake of a college living but not being fond of that prospect accepted instead the office of traveling companion to a marquess and afterward to young grandcourt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9828,248-130652-0032,who had lost his father early and who found lush so convenient that he had allowed him to become prime minister in all his more personal affairs the habit of fifteen years had made grandcourt more and more in need of lush's handiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9829,248-130652-0033,and lush more and more in need of the lazy luxury to which his transactions on behalf of grandcourt made no interruption worth reckoning i cannot say that the same lengthened habit had intensified grandcourt's want of respect for his companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9830,248-130652-0034,since that want had been absolute from the beginning but it had confirmed his sense that he might kick lush if he chose only he never did choose to kick any animal because the act of kicking is a compromising attitude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9831,248-130652-0035,and a gentleman's dogs should be kicked for him he only said things which might have exposed himself to be kicked if his confidant had been a man of independent spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9832,248-130652-0036,but what son of a vicar who has stinted his wife and daughters of calico in order to send his male offspring to oxford can keep an independent spirit when he is bent on dining with high discrimination riding good horses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9833,248-130652-0037,living generally in the most luxuriant honey blossomed clover and all without working mister lush had passed for a scholar once and had still a sense of scholarship when he was not trying to remember much of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9834,248-130652-0038,since in his own opinion he had never done a bad action it did not seem necessary to consider whether he should be likely to commit one if his love of ease required it lush's love of ease was well satisfied at present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9835,248-130652-0039,and if his puddings were rolled toward him in the dust he took the inside bits and found them relishing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9837,248-130697-0001,deeds are the pulse of time his beating life and righteous or unrighteous being done must throb in after throbs till time itself be laid in darkness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9838,248-130697-0002,and the universe quiver and breathe upon no mirror more in the evening she sent for him again it was already near the hour at which she had been brought in from the sea the evening before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9839,248-130697-0003,and the light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open she was seated gazing fixedly on the sea resting her cheek on her hand looking less shattered than when he had left her but with a deep melancholy in her expression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9840,248-130697-0004,which as deronda approached her passed into an anxious timidity she did not put out her hand but said how long ago it is then will you sit near me again a little while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9841,248-130697-0005,and again turned with the same expression which yet did not issue in speech there was some fear hindering her and deronda wishing to relieve her timidity averted his face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9842,248-130697-0006,presently he heard her cry imploringly you will not say that any one else should know most decidedly not said deronda there is no action that ought to be taken in consequence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9843,248-130697-0007,but if i had not had that murderous will that moment if i had thrown the rope on the instant perhaps it would have hindered death no i think not said deronda slowly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9844,248-130697-0008,if it were true that he could swim he must have been seized with cramp with your quickest utmost effort it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9845,248-130697-0009,that momentary murderous will cannot i think have altered the course of events its effect is confined to the motives in your own breast within ourselves our evil will is momentous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9846,248-130697-0010,and sooner or later it works its way outside us it may be in the vitiation that breeds evil acts but also it may be in the self abhorrence that stings us into better striving i am saved from robbing others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9847,248-130697-0011,she spoke hesitatingly i had not thought of them said deronda i was thinking too much of the other things perhaps you don't quite know the beginning of it all said gwendolen slowly as if she were overcoming her reluctance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9848,248-130697-0012,there was some one else he ought to have married and i knew it and i told her i would not hinder it and i went away that was when you first saw me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9849,248-130697-0013,but then we became poor all at once and i was very miserable and i was tempted i thought i shall do as i like and make everything right i persuaded myself and it was all different it was all dreadful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9850,248-130697-0014,then came hatred and wicked thoughts that was how it all came i told you i was afraid of myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9851,248-130697-0015,if you did not know how miserable i was you might but now it has all been no use i can care for nothing but saving the rest from knowing poor mamma,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9852,248-130697-0016,worth anything worthy enough i shall always be too wicked to the voice broke off helpless deronda's heart was pierced he turned his eyes on her poor beseeching face and said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9853,248-130697-0017,i believe that you may become worthier than you have ever yet been worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing no evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love and desire to continue in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9854,248-130697-0018,and make no effort to escape from you have made efforts you will go on making them but you were the beginning of them you must not forsake me said gwendolen leaning with her clasped hands on the arm of her chair and looking at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9855,248-130697-0019,while her face bore piteous traces of the life experience concentrated in the twenty four hours that new terrible life lying on the other side of the deed which fulfills a criminal desire i will bear any penance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9856,248-130697-0020,i will lead any life you tell me but you must not forsake me you must be near if you had been near me if i could have said everything to you i should have been different you will not forsake me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9857,248-130697-0021,it could never be my impulse to forsake you said deronda promptly with that voice which like his eyes had the unintentional effect of making his ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it really was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9858,248-130697-0022,and in that moment he was not himself quite free from a foreboding of some such self committing effect his strong feeling for this stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future difficulty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9859,248-130697-0023,to an indefinite hope anxieties both immediate and distant crowded on his thought and it was under their influence that after a moment's silence he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9860,248-130697-0024,and i am not without hope that missus davilow may shortly follow him her presence will be the greatest comfort to you it will give you a motive to save her from unnecessary pain yes yes i will try and you will not go away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9861,248-130697-0025,not till after sir hugo has come but we shall all go to england as soon as possible said deronda not wishing to enter into particulars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9862,248-130697-0026,gwendolen looked toward the window again with an expression which seemed like a gradual awakening to new thoughts the twilight was perceptibly deepening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9863,248-130697-0027,or else at diplow i am quite uncertain where i shall live said deronda coloring she was warned by his changed color that she had spoken too rashly and fell silent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9864,248-130697-0028,when you are among your friends again you will discern new duties said deronda make it a task now to get as well and calm as much like yourself as you can before he hesitated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9865,248-130697-0029,before my mother comes said gwendolen ah i must be changed i have not looked at myself should you have known me she added turning toward him if you had met me now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9866,248-130697-0030,should you have known me for the one you saw at leubronn yes i should have known you said deronda mournfully the outside change is not great i should have seen at once that it was you and that you had gone through some great sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9867,248-130697-0031,don't wish now that you had never seen me don't wish that said gwendolen imploringly while the tears gathered i should despise myself for wishing it said deronda how could i know what i was wishing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9868,248-130697-0032,we must find our duties in what comes to us not in what we imagine might have been if i took to foolish wishing of that sort i should wish not that i had never seen you but that i had been able to save you from this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9869,248-130697-0033,you have saved me from worse said gwendolen in a sobbing voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9870,248-130697-0034,it will be better for me to go now said deronda worn in spirit by the perpetual strain of this scene remember what we said of your task to get well and calm before other friends come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9871,248-130697-0035,he rose as he spoke and she gave him her hand submissively but when he had left her she sank on her knees in hysterical crying the distance between them was too great,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9872,248-130697-0036,beholding a possible life which she had sinned herself away from,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9873,248-130644-0000,it would be a little hard to blame the rector of pennicote that in the course of looking at things from every point of view he looked at gwendolen as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9874,248-130644-0001,why should he be expected to differ from his contemporaries in this matter and wish his niece a worse end of her charming maidenhood than they would approve as the best possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9875,248-130644-0002,it is rather to be set down to his credit that his feelings on the subject were entirely good natured and in considering the relation of means to ends it would have been mere folly to have been guided by the exceptional and idyllic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9876,248-130644-0003,in order that a marquis might fall in love with her or to have insisted that since a fair maiden was to be sought she should keep herself out of the way mister gascoigne's calculations were of the kind called rational,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9877,248-130644-0004,and he did not even think of getting a too frisky horse in order that gwendolen might be threatened with an accident and be rescued by a man of property he wished his niece well and he meant her to be seen to advantage in the best society of the neighborhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9878,248-130644-0005,her uncle's intention fell in perfectly with gwendolen's own wishes but let no one suppose that she also contemplated a brilliant marriage as the direct end of her witching the world with her grace on horseback or with any other accomplishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9879,248-130644-0006,that she was to be married some time or other she would have felt obliged to admit and that her marriage would not be of a middling kind such as most girls were contented with she felt quietly unargumentatively sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9880,248-130644-0007,but her thoughts never dwelt on marriage as the fulfillment of her ambition the dramas in which she imagined herself a heroine were not wrought up to that close to be very much sued or hopelessly sighed for as a bride was indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9881,248-130644-0008,an indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power but to become a wife and wear all the domestic fetters of that condition was on the whole a vexatious necessity her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9882,248-130644-0009,in which a woman could not do what she liked had more children than were desirable was consequently dull and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum of course marriage was social promotion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9883,248-130644-0010,she could not look forward to a single life but promotions have sometimes to be taken with bitter herbs a peerage will not quite do instead of leadership to the man who meant to lead and this delicate limbed sylph of twenty meant to lead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9884,248-130644-0011,for such passions dwell in feminine breasts also in gwendolen's however they dwelt among strictly feminine furniture and had no disturbing reference to the advancement of learning or the balance of the constitution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9885,248-130644-0012,her knowledge being such as with no sort of standing room or length of lever could have been expected to move the world she meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9886,248-130644-0013,and to have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in which no will was present it was not to be so with her she would no longer be sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9887,248-130644-0014,but would make the very best of the chances that life offered her and conquer circumstances by her exceptional cleverness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9888,248-130644-0015,the archery club and invitations to dine with the arrowpoints as the highest lights in her scenery was not a position that seemed to offer remarkable chances but gwendolen's confidence lay chiefly in herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9889,248-130644-0016,she felt well equipped for the mastery of life with regard to much in her lot hitherto she held herself rather hardly dealt with but as to her education she would have admitted that it had left her under no disadvantages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9890,248-130644-0017,in the school room her quick mind had taken readily that strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts which saves ignorance from any painful sense of limpness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9891,248-130644-0018,and what remained of all things knowable she was conscious of being sufficiently acquainted with through novels plays and poems about her french and music the two justifying accomplishments of a young lady she felt no ground for uneasiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9892,248-130644-0019,and when to all these qualifications negative and positive we add the spontaneous sense of capability some happy persons are born with so that any subject they turn their attention to impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9893,248-130644-0020,who can wonder if gwendolen felt ready to manage her own destiny there were many subjects in the world perhaps the majority in which she felt no interest because they were stupid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9894,248-130644-0021,for subjects are apt to appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old but she would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had turned up in conversation it must be remembered that no one had disputed her power or her general superiority,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9895,248-130644-0022,what will gwendolen think if the footman trod heavily in creaking boots or if the laundress's work was unsatisfactory the maid said this will never do for miss harleth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9896,248-130644-0023,if the wood smoked in the bedroom fireplace missus davilow whose own weak eyes suffered much from this inconvenience spoke apologetically of it to gwendolen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9897,248-130644-0024,if when they were under the stress of traveling she did not appear at the breakfast table till every one else had finished the only question was how gwendolen's coffee and toast should still be of the hottest and crispest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9898,248-130644-0025,it was always she herself who had to be tolerant to beg that alice who sat waiting on her would not stick up her shoulders in that frightful manner and that isabel instead of pushing up to her and asking questions would go away to miss merry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

9962,196-122159-0011,heavy prod gets home the bond is found to be close that besides the fellowship of the craft there is felt the strength of a wider feeling the feeling that binds a man to a child he was there before me believing that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9963,196-122159-0012,and he had been deliberating upon death confound him he had found that to meditate about because he thought he had saved his life while all its glamour had gone with the ship in the night what more natural,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9964,196-122159-0013,and his voice spoke i was so lost you know it was the sort of thing one does not expect to happen to one it was not like a fight for instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9965,196-122159-0014,he appeared changed as if he had suddenly matured one couldn't be sure he muttered ah you were not sure i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9966,196-122159-0015,and was placated by the sound of a faint sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird in the night well i wasn't he said courageously it was something like that wretched story they made up it was not a lie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9967,196-122159-0016,but it wasn't truth all the same it was something one knows a downright lie there was not the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and the wrong of this affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9968,196-122159-0017,how much more did you want i asked but i think i spoke so low that he did not catch what i said he had advanced his argument as though life had been a network of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9969,196-122159-0018,his voice sounded reasonable suppose i had not i mean to say suppose i had stuck to the ship well how much longer say a minute half a minute,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9970,196-122159-0019,i interjected i would have meant to be he retorted and that's more than i meant when i he shivered as if about to swallow some nauseous drug jumped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9971,196-122159-0020,he pronounced with a convulsive effort whose stress as if propagated by the waves of the air made my body stir a little in the chair he fixed me with lowering eyes don't you believe me he cried i swear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9972,196-122159-0021,i ought to have known i am i am a gentleman too yes yes i said hastily he was looking me squarely in the face and withdrew his gaze slowly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9973,196-122159-0022,now you understand why i didn't after all didn't go out in that way i wasn't going to be frightened at what i had done and anyhow if i had stuck to the ship i would have done my best to be saved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9974,196-122159-0023,men have been known to float for hours in the open sea and be picked up not much the worse for it i might have lasted it out better than many others there's nothing the matter with my heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9975,196-122159-0024,a hair's breadth he muttered not the breadth of a hair between this and that and at the time it is difficult to see a hair at midnight i put in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9976,196-122159-0025,a little viciously i fear don't you see what i mean by the solidarity of the craft i was aggrieved against him as though he had cheated me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9977,196-122159-0026,keep up the illusion of my beginnings as though he had robbed our common life of the last spark of its glamour and so you cleared out at once jumped he corrected me incisively jumped mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9978,196-122159-0027,he repeated and i wondered at the evident but obscure intention well yes perhaps i could not see then but i had plenty of time and any amount of light in that boat and i could think too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9979,196-122159-0028,nobody would know of course but this did not make it any easier for me you've got to believe that too i did not want all this talk no yes i won't lie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9980,196-122159-0029,i wanted it it is the very thing i wanted there do you think you or anybody could have made me if i i am i am not afraid to tell and i wasn't afraid to think either i looked it in the face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9981,196-122159-0030,i wasn't going to run away at first at night if it hadn't been for those fellows i might have no by heavens i was not going to give them that satisfaction they had done enough they made up a story and believed it for all i know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9982,196-122159-0031,but i knew the truth and i would live it down alone with myself i wasn't going to give in to such a beastly unfair thing what did it prove after all i was confoundedly cut up sick of life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9983,196-122159-0032,no the proper thing was to face it out alone for myself wait for another chance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9984,196-122152-0000,he said speaking of the ship she went over whatever it was as easy as a snake crawling over a stick the illustration was good the questions were aiming at facts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9985,196-122152-0001,and the official inquiry was being held in the police court of an eastern port he stood elevated in the witness box with burning cheeks in a cool lofty room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9986,196-122152-0002,the big framework of punkahs moved gently to and fro high above his head and from below many eyes were looking at him out of dark faces out of white faces out of red faces out of faces attentive spellbound,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9987,196-122152-0003,as if all these people sitting in orderly rows upon narrow benches had been enslaved by the fascination of his voice it was very loud it rang startling in his own ears it was the only sound audible in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9988,196-122152-0004,for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast came to him poignant and silent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9989,196-122152-0005,outside the court the sun blazed within was the wind of great punkahs that made you shiver the shame that made you burn the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed the face of the presiding magistrate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9990,196-122152-0006,clean shaved and impassible looked at him deadly pale between the red faces of the two nautical assessors the light of a broad window under the ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9991,196-122152-0007,as if facts could explain anything after you had concluded you had collided with something floating awash say a water logged wreck you were ordered by your captain to go forward and ascertain if there was any damage done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9992,196-122152-0008,looking at jim with thoughtful blue eyes the other a heavy scornful man thrown back in his seat his left arm extended full length drummed delicately with his finger tips on a blotting pad in the middle the magistrate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9993,196-122152-0009,i was told to call no one and to make no noise for fear of creating a panic i thought the precaution reasonable i took one of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward after opening the forepeak hatch i heard splashing in there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9994,196-122152-0010,his fingers played incessantly touching the paper without noise i did not think of danger just then i might have been a little startled all this happened in such a quiet way and so very suddenly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9995,196-122152-0011,i knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating the forepeak from the forehold i went back to tell the captain i came upon the second engineer getting up at the foot of the bridge ladder he seemed dazed and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9996,196-122152-0012,told me he thought his left arm was broken he had slipped on the top step when getting down while i was forward he exclaimed my god that rotten bulkhead'll give way in a minute,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9997,196-122152-0013,he did not strike him again he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9998,196-122152-0014,stop the engines instead of making a row about it on deck i heard him say get up run fly he swore also the engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine room companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
9999,196-122152-0015,which was on the port side he moaned as he ran he spoke slowly he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness he could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the better information of these men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10000,196-122152-0016,who wanted facts after his first feeling of revolt he had come round to the view that only a meticulous precision of statement would bring out the true horror behind the appalling face of things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10001,196-122152-0017,the facts those men were so eager to know had been visible tangible open to the senses occupying their place in space and time requiring for their existence a fourteen hundred ton steamer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10002,196-122152-0018,perdition that dwelt within like a malevolent soul in a detestable body he was anxious to make this clear this had not been a common affair everything in it had been of the utmost importance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10003,196-122152-0019,and fortunately he remembered everything he wanted to go on talking for truth's sake perhaps for his own sake also and while his utterance was deliberate his mind positively flew round and round the serried circle of facts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10004,196-122152-0020,he seemed calm enough only he stumbled several times and once as i stood speaking to him he walked right into me as though he had been stone blind he made no definite answer to what i had to tell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10005,196-122152-0021,felt a shiver run down his back the big assessor had dropped his eyelids and drummed on without a sound careless and mournful the eyes of the other above the sunburnt clasped fingers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10006,196-122152-0022,the magistrate had swayed forward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10007,196-122152-0023,he rested his temple in the palm of his hand the wind of the punkahs eddied down on the heads on the dark faced natives wound about in voluminous draperies on the europeans sitting together very hot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10008,196-122152-0024,and in drill suits that seemed to fit them as close as their skins and holding their round pith hats on their knees while gliding along the walls the court peons buttoned tight in long white coats flitted rapidly to and fro,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10009,196-122152-0025,rested upon a white man who sat apart from the others with his face worn and clouded but with quiet eyes that glanced straight interested and clear jim answered another question and was tempted to cry out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10010,196-122152-0026,what's the good of this what's the good he tapped with his foot slightly bit his lip and looked away over the heads he met the eyes of the white man the glance directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10011,196-122152-0027,it was an act of intelligent volition jim between two questions forgot himself so far as to find leisure for a thought this fellow ran the thought looks at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10012,196-122152-0028,he had come across that man before in the street perhaps he was positive he had never spoken to him for days for many days he had spoken to no one but had held silent incoherent and endless converse with himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10013,196-122152-0029,like a prisoner alone in his cell or like a wayfarer lost in a wilderness at present he was answering questions that did not matter though they had a purpose but he doubted whether he would ever again speak out as long as he lived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10014,196-122152-0030,the sound of his own truthful statements confirmed his deliberate opinion that speech was of no use to him any longer that man there seemed to be aware of his hopeless difficulty jim looked at him then turned away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10015,196-122152-0031,and audibly perhaps it would be after dinner on a verandah draped in motionless foliage and crowned with flowers in the deep dusk speckled by fiery cigar ends the elongated bulk of each cane chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10016,196-122152-0032,harboured a silent listener now and then a small red glow would move abruptly and expanding light up the fingers of a languid hand part of a face in profound repose or flash a crimson gleam into a pair of pensive eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10017,196-122152-0033,overshadowed by a fragment of an unruffled forehead and with the very first word uttered marlow's body extended at rest in the seat would become very still as though his spirit had winged its way back into the lapse of time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10018,2002-139469-0000,some disorder had surely crept into the course of the elements destroying their benignant influence the wind prince of air raged through his kingdom lashing the sea into fury,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10144,5463-39174-0010,yes i have heard of it said mister crawley gravely i hope that his promotion may tend in every way to his advantage here and hereafter it seemed however to be manifest from the manner in which he expressed his kind wishes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10145,5463-39174-0011,that his hopes and expectations did not go hand in hand together by the by he desired us to say that he will call here to morrow at about eleven didn't he say fanny yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10146,5463-39174-0012,looking up for a moment from the anxious discussion in which she was already engaged with missus crawley on nursery matters pray tell him said mister crawley that i shall be happy to see him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10147,5463-39174-0013,his new duties do not disturb him much as yet said lucy and his riding over here will be no trouble to him yes there he has the advantage over me i unfortunately have no horse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10148,5463-39174-0014,and then lucy began petting the little boy and by degrees slipped a small bag of gingerbread nuts out of her muff into his hands she had not the patience necessary for waiting as had her sister in law the boy took the bag peeped into it and then looked up into her face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10149,5463-39174-0015,what is that bob said mister crawley gingerbread faltered bobby feeling that a sin had been committed though probably feeling also that he himself could hardly as yet be accounted as deeply guilty miss robarts said the father we are very much obliged to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10150,5463-39174-0016,but our children are hardly used to such things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10151,5463-39174-0017,oh certainly bob my child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10152,5463-39174-0018,and then the bag in a solemn manner was carried over to their mother who taking it from her son's hands laid it high on a bookshelf and not one now said lucy robarts very piteously don't be so hard mister crawley not upon them but upon me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10153,5463-39174-0019,this was very discouraging to lucy if one small bag of gingerbread nuts created so great a difficulty how was she to dispose of the pot of guava jelly and box of bonbons which were still in her muff or how distribute the packet of oranges with which the pony carriage was laden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10154,5463-39174-0020,and there was jelly for the sick child and chicken broth which was indeed another jelly and to tell the truth openly there was also a joint of fresh pork and a basket of eggs from the framley parsonage farmyard which missus robarts was to introduce should she find herself capable of doing so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10155,5463-39174-0021,but which would certainly be cast out with utter scorn by mister crawley if tendered in his immediate presence there had also been a suggestion as to adding two or three bottles of port but the courage of the ladies had failed them on that head and the wine was not now added to their difficulties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10156,5463-39174-0022,lucy found it very difficult to keep up a conversation with mister crawley the more so as missus robarts and missus crawley presently withdrew into a bedroom taking the two younger children with them how unlucky thought lucy that she has not got my muff with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10157,5463-39174-0023,but the muff lay in her lap ponderous with its rich enclosures i suppose you will live in barchester for a portion of the year now said mister crawley i really do not know as yet mark talks of taking lodgings for his first month's residence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10158,5463-39174-0024,mark thinks that as he is so near he need not be much absent from framley even during his residence and then lady lufton is so good about the schools ah yes but lady lufton is not a clergyman miss robarts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10159,5463-39174-0025,it was on lucy's tongue to say that her ladyship was pretty nearly as bad but she stopped herself at this moment providence sent great relief to miss robarts in the shape of missus crawley's red armed maid of all work who walking up to her master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10160,5463-39174-0026,whispered into his ear that he was wanted it was the time of day at which his attendance was always required in his parish school and that attendance being so punctually given those who wanted him looked for him there at this hour and if he were absent did not scruple to send for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10161,5463-39174-0027,miss robarts i am afraid you must excuse me said he getting up and taking his hat and stick lucy begged that she might not be at all in the way and already began to speculate how she might best unload her treasures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10162,5463-39174-0028,and then stick in hand he walked forth and lucy fancied that bobby's eyes immediately rested on the bag of gingerbread nuts bob said she almost in a whisper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10163,5463-39174-0029,i have left a book behind me he said and coming back through the room he took up the well worn prayer book which accompanied him in all his wanderings through the parish bobby when he saw his father had retreated a few steps back as also did grace who to confess the truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10164,5463-39174-0030,had been attracted by the sound of sugar plums in spite of the irregular verbs and lucy withdrew her hand from her muff and looked guilty was she not deceiving the good man nay teaching his own children to deceive him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10165,5463-39174-0031,but there are men made of such stuff that an angel could hardly live with them without some deceit papa's gone now whispered bobby i saw him turn round the corner he at any rate had learned his lesson as it was natural that he should do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10166,5463-39174-0032,some one else also had learned that papa was gone for while bob and grace were still counting the big lumps of sugar candy each employed the while for inward solace with an inch of barley sugar the front door opened and a big basket and a bundle done up in a kitchen cloth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10167,5463-39174-0033,i did venture to bring them said fanny with a look of shame for i know how a sick child occupies the whole house ah my friend said missus crawley taking hold of missus robarts arm and looking into her face that sort of shame is over with me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10168,5463-39174-0034,god has tried us with want and for my children's sake i am glad of such relief but will he be angry i will manage it dear missus robarts you must not be surprised at him his lot is sometimes very hard to bear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10169,5463-39174-0035,such things are so much worse for a man than for a woman fanny was not quite prepared to admit this in her own heart but she made no reply on that head i am sure i hope we may be able to be of use to you she said if you will only look upon me as an old friend and write to me if you want me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10170,5463-39174-0036,to feel herself so different from the wives of other clergymen around her to know that they lived softly while she with all the work of her hands and unceasing struggle of her energies could hardly manage to place wholesome food before her husband and children it was a terrible thing a grievous thing to think of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10171,5463-39174-0037,that all the work of her mind should be given up to such subjects as these but nevertheless she could bear it she said as long as he would carry himself like a man and face his lot boldly before the world and then she told how he had been better there at hogglestock than in their former residence down in cornwall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10172,5463-39174-0038,missus arabin told me that she was so anxious you should go to them said missus robarts ah yes but that i fear is impossible the children you know missus robarts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10173,5463-39174-0039,oh no i could not punish you for your goodness in that way but he would not go he could go and leave me at home sometimes i have thought that it might be so and i have done all in my power to persuade him i have told him that if he could mix once more with the world with the clerical world you know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10174,5463-39174-0040,that he would be better fitted for the performance of his own duties but he answers me angrily that it is impossible that his coat is not fit for the dean's table and missus crawley almost blushed as she spoke of such a reason what with an old friend like doctor arabin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10175,5463-39174-0041,but what can i do i fear that he regards the rich as his enemies he is pining for the solace of some friend to whom he could talk for some equal with a mind educated like his own to whose thoughts he could listen and to whom he could speak his own thoughts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10176,5463-39174-0042,but such a friend must be equal not only in mind but in purse and where can he ever find such a man as that but you may get better preferment ah no and if he did we are hardly fit for it now if i could think that i could educate my children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10177,5463-39174-0043,if i could only do something for my poor grace in answer to this missus robarts said a word or two but not much she resolved however that if she could get her husband's leave something should be done for grace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10178,5463-39174-0044,and was it not incumbent on her to make some kindly use of all the goods with which providence had blessed herself and then they went back to the sitting room each again with a young child in her arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10179,5463-39174-0045,lucy had been engaged the while with the children and when the two married ladies entered they found that a shop had been opened at which all manner of luxuries were being readily sold and purchased at marvellously easy prices the guava jelly was there and the oranges and the sugar plums red and yellow and striped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10180,5463-39174-0046,and moreover the gingerbread had been taken down in the audacity of their commercial speculations and the nuts were spread out upon a board behind which lucy stood as shop girl disposing of them for kisses mamma mamma said bobby running up to his mother you must buy something of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10181,5463-39174-0047,and he pointed with his fingers at the shop girl you must give her two kisses for that heap of barley sugar looking at bobby's mouth at the time one would have said that his kisses might be dispensed with when they were again in the pony carriage behind the impatient puck and were well away from the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10182,5463-39174-0048,fanny was the first to speak how very different those two are she said different in their minds and in their spirit but how much higher toned is her mind than his how weak he is in many things and how strong she is in everything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10183,5463-39174-0049,how false is his pride and how false his shame but we must remember what he has to bear it is not every one that can endure such a life as his without false pride and false shame but she has neither said lucy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10184,5463-39174-0050,because you have one hero in a family does that give you a right to expect another said missus robarts of all my own acquaintance missus crawley i think comes nearest to heroism and then they passed by the hogglestock school and mister crawley when he heard the noise of the wheels came out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10185,5463-39173-0000,chapter twenty one why puck the pony was beaten mark robarts returned home the day after the scene at the albany considerably relieved in spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10186,5463-39173-0001,indeed after what mister sowerby had said and after lord lufton's assent to it it would have been madness he considered to decline it and then too mister sowerby's promise about the bills was very comfortable to him after all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10187,5463-39173-0002,on the day after his return he received proper authentic tidings of his presentation to the prebend he was in fact already prebendary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10188,5463-39173-0003,the income was already his own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10189,5463-39173-0004,the enjoyment of one's own happiness at such windfalls depends so much on the free and freely expressed enjoyment of others lady lufton's congratulations had nearly made him throw up the whole thing but his wife's smiles re encouraged him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10190,5463-39173-0005,and lucy's warm and eager joy made him feel quite delighted with mister sowerby and the duke of omnium and then that splendid animal dandy came home to the parsonage stables much to the delight of the groom and gardener,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10191,5463-39173-0006,which he had bought from mister sowerby some little time since with the object of obliging him he mark intended to sell him again as soon as he could do so judiciously this as i have said above was not satisfactory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10192,5463-39173-0007,neither of the two ladies at framley parsonage knew much about horses or of the manner in which one gentleman might think it proper to oblige another by purchasing the superfluities of his stable but they did both feel that there were horses enough in the parsonage stable without dandy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10193,5463-39173-0008,and that the purchasing of a hunter with the view of immediately selling him again was to say the least of it an operation hardly congenial with the usual tastes and pursuits of a clergyman i hope you did not give very much money for him mark said fanny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10194,5463-39173-0009,not more than i shall get again said mark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10195,5463-39173-0010,i suppose i shall have to go into residence almost immediately said mark recurring to the more agreeable subject of the stall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10196,5463-39173-0011,the house will not be furnished will it mark said his wife i don't know how we shall get on don't frighten yourselves i shall take lodgings in barchester and we shall not see you all the time said missus robarts with dismay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10197,5463-39173-0012,but the prebendary explained that he would be backwards and forwards at framley every week and that in all probability he would only sleep at barchester on the saturdays and sundays and perhaps not always then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10198,5463-39173-0013,the worst of it is that both of them are obliged to wear wigs shall you have a hat mark with curly things at the side and strings through to hold them up asked lucy i fear that does not come within my perquisites nor a rosette,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10199,5463-39173-0014,it was now the month of april and the fields were beginning to look green and the wind had got itself out of the east and was soft and genial and the early spring flowers were showing their bright colours in the parsonage garden and all things were sweet and pleasant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10200,5463-39173-0015,went away when the spring came leaving their houses innocent and empty the parish duty was better attended to and perhaps domestic duties also at such period he was a pattern parson and a pattern husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10201,5463-39173-0016,atoning to his own conscience for past shortcomings by present zeal and then though she had never acknowledged it to herself the absence of her dear friend lady lufton was perhaps in itself not disagreeable missus robarts did love lady lufton heartily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10202,5463-39173-0017,indeed just at this moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10203,5463-39173-0018,dandy was rather a thorn in his side those wretched bills were to come due early in may and before the end of april sowerby wrote to him saying that he was doing his utmost to provide for the evil day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10204,5463-39173-0019,but that if the price of dandy could be remitted to him at once it would greatly facilitate his object nothing could be more different than mister sowerby's tone about money at different times when he wanted to raise the wind everything was so important,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10205,5463-39173-0020,haste and superhuman efforts and men running to and fro with blank acceptances in their hands could alone stave off the crack of doom but at other times when retaliatory applications were made to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10206,5463-39173-0021,he could prove with the easiest voice and most jaunty manner that everything was quite serene now at this period he was in that mood of superhuman efforts and he called loudly for the hundred and thirty pounds for dandy after what had passed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10207,5463-39173-0022,mark could not bring himself to say that he would pay nothing till the bills were safe and therefore with the assistance of mister forrest of the bank he did remit the price of dandy to his friend sowerby in london and lucy robarts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10208,5463-39173-0023,she had declared to him plainly that she did not love him and could not love him and had thus thrown away not only riches and honour and high station but more than that much worse than that she had flung away from her the lover to whose love her warm heart clung,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10209,5463-39173-0024,that her love did cling to him she knew even then and owned more thoroughly as soon as he was gone so much her pride had done for her and that strong resolve that lady lufton should not scowl on her and tell her that she had entrapped her son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10210,5463-39173-0025,i know it will be said of lord lufton himself that putting aside his peerage and broad acres and handsome sonsy face he was not worth a girl's care and love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10211,5463-39173-0026,but what would the world come to if none but absolute true heroes were to be thought worthy of women's love what would the men do and what oh what would become of the women,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10212,5463-39173-0027,lucy robarts in her heart did not give her dismissed lover credit for much more heroism than did truly appertain to him did not perhaps give him full credit for a certain amount of heroism which did really appertain to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10213,5463-39173-0028,treats herself as a farmer treats his sheep and oxen makes hardly more of herself of her own inner self in which are comprised a mind and soul than the poor wretch of her own sex who earns her bread in the lowest stage of degradation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10214,5463-39173-0029,but a title and an estate and an income are matters which will weigh in the balance with all eve's daughters as they do with all adam's sons pride of place and the power of living well in front of the world's eye are dear to us all are doubtless intended to be dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10215,5463-39173-0030,the mistress of such a destiny what more or what better could the world have done for her and now she had thrown all that aside because she would not endure that lady lufton should call her a scheming artful girl actuated by that fear she had repulsed him with a falsehood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10216,5463-39173-0031,though the matter was one on which it was so terribly expedient that she should tell the truth and yet she was cheerful with her brother and sister in law,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10217,5463-39173-0032,it was when she was quite alone at night in her own room or in her solitary walks that a single silent tear would gather in the corner of her eye and gradually moisten her eyelids she never told her love nor did she allow concealment to feed on her damask cheek,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10218,5463-39173-0033,in all her employments in her ways about the house and her accustomed quiet mirth she was the same as ever in this she showed the peculiar strength which god had given her but not the less did she in truth mourn for her lost love and spoiled ambition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10219,5463-39173-0034,we are going to drive over to hogglestock this morning fanny said one day at breakfast i suppose mark you won't go with us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10220,5463-39173-0035,the pony carriage is wretched for three oh as for that i should have thought the new horse might have been able to carry you as far as that i heard you say you wanted to see mister crawley so i do and the new horse as you call him shall carry me there to morrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10221,5463-39173-0036,will you say that i'll be over about twelve o'clock you had better say earlier as he is always out about the parish very well say eleven it is parish business about which i am going so it need not irk his conscience to stay in for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10222,5463-39173-0037,well lucy we must drive ourselves that's all you shall be charioteer going and then we'll change coming back to all which lucy agreed and as soon as their work in the school was over they started,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10223,5463-39173-0038,not a word had been spoken between them about lord lufton since that evening now more than a month ago on which they had been walking together in the garden lucy had so demeaned herself on that occasion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10224,5463-39173-0039,as to make her sister in law quite sure that there had been no love passages up to that time and nothing had since occurred which had created any suspicion in missus robarts mind she had seen at once that all the close intimacy between them was over and thought that everything was as it should be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10225,5463-39173-0040,but she did not betray herself perhaps he may she said and then gave the pony a little touch with her whip oh lucy i won't have puck beaten he was going very nicely i beg puck's pardon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10226,5463-39173-0041,but you see when one is trusted with a whip one feels such a longing to use it oh but you should keep it still i feel almost certain that lady lufton would like such a match i daresay she might miss grantly will have a large fortune i believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10227,5463-39173-0042,and then she is quiet and reserved she does not require excitement and i am sure is conscientious in the performance of her duties very conscientious i have no doubt said lucy with something like a sneer in her tone but the question i suppose is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10228,5463-39173-0043,whether lord lufton likes her i think he does in a sort of way he did not talk to her so much as he did to you ah that was all lady lufton's fault because she didn't have him properly labelled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10229,5463-39173-0044,oh by god's mercy very little as for me i shall get over it in three or four years i don't doubt that's if i can get ass's milk and change of air we'll take you to barchester for that but as i was saying i really do think lord lufton likes griselda grantly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10230,5463-39173-0045,then i really do think that he has uncommon bad taste said lucy with a reality in her voice differing much from the tone of banter she had hitherto used what lucy said her sister in law looking at her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10231,5463-39173-0046,there is i believe nothing in her mentally whatever may be her moral excellences to me she is more absolutely like a statue than any other human being i ever saw to sit still and be admired is all that she desires and if she cannot get that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10232,5463-39173-0047,to sit still and not be admired would almost suffice for her i do not worship lady lufton as you do but i think quite well enough of her to wonder that she should choose such a girl as that for her son's wife that she does wish it i do not doubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10233,5463-39173-0048,but i shall indeed be surprised if he wishes it also and then as she finished her speech lucy again flogged the pony this she did in vexation because she felt that the tell tale blood had suffused her face why lucy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10234,5463-39173-0049,if he were your brother you could not be more eager about it no i could not he is the only man friend with whom i was ever intimate and i cannot bear to think that he should throw himself away it's horridly improper to care about such a thing i have no doubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10235,5463-39173-0050,i shall not be satisfied it's no use your looking at me fanny you will make me talk of it and i won't tell a lie on the subject i do like lord lufton very much and i do dislike griselda grantly almost as much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10236,5463-39173-0051,therefore i shall not be satisfied if they become man and wife however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10237,5463-39173-0052,there was then nothing more said on the subject and in two minutes they arrived at the house of the hogglestock clergyman missus crawley had brought two children with her when she came from the cornish curacy to hogglestock and two other babies had been added to her cares since then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10238,5463-39173-0053,one of these was now ill with croup and it was with the object of offering to the mother some comfort and solace that the present visit was made the two ladies got down from their carriage having obtained the services of a boy to hold puck and soon found themselves in missus crawley's single sitting room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10239,5463-39173-0054,which they knew it would be impossible to introduce in mister crawley's presence she as we have said was not quite so gaunt not altogether so haggard as in the latter of those dreadful cornish days lady lufton and missus arabin between them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10240,5463-39173-0055,and the scanty comfort of their improved though still wretched income had done something towards bringing her back to the world in which she had lived in the soft days of her childhood but even the liberal stipend of a hundred and thirty pounds a year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10241,5463-39173-0056,liberal according to the scale by which the incomes of clergymen in some of our new districts are now apportioned would not admit of a gentleman with his wife and four children living with the ordinary comforts of an artisan's family,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10242,5463-39173-0057,as regards the mere eating and drinking the amounts of butcher's meat and tea and butter they of course were used in quantities which any artisan would have regarded as compatible only with demi starvation better clothing for her children was necessary and better clothing for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10243,5463-39173-0058,as for her own raiment the wives of few artisans would have been content to put up with missus crawley's best gown the stuff of which it was made had been paid for by her mother when she with much difficulty bestowed upon her daughter her modest wedding trousseau,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10244,5463-39173-0059,lucy had never seen missus crawley these visits to hogglestock were not frequent and had generally been made by lady lufton and missus robarts together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10245,5463-39173-0060,almost as penniless as the curate himself then they would walk together for hours along the rock bound shore listening to the waves discussing deep polemical mysteries sometimes with hot fury then again with tender loving charity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10246,5463-39173-0061,but always with a mutual acknowledgment of each other's truth now they lived comparatively near together but no opportunities arose for such discussions at any rate once a quarter mister crawley was pressed by his old friend to visit him at the deanery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10247,5463-39173-0062,and doctor arabin had promised that no one else should be in the house if mister crawley objected to society but this was not what he wanted the finery and grandeur of the deanery and the comfort of that warm snug library would silence him at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10248,5463-39173-0063,then old days would have come back to them but now arabin always rides on a sleek fine horse now a days he once said to his wife with a sneer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10251,8123-275193-0002,made him one of the most popular officers in the whole fleet he entered into all of their sports and sympathized with the discomforts of forecastle life he was fond of animal pets and always welcomed the arrival of a new one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10252,8123-275193-0003,he was a perfectly black pig of the racer razor back order which at that time were plentiful in the coast sections of the more southern of the slave holding states they were called racers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10253,8123-275193-0004,because of their long legs slender bodies and great capacity for running and razor backs on account of the prominence of the spinal column the origin of this particular species of the porcine tribe is unknown but there is a tradition to the effect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10254,8123-275193-0005,possibly while escaping from the prospective mess kettle of a confederate picket in those days confederate pickets were not very particular as to the quality or kind of food and i have a suspicion that even a razor back would have been a welcome addition to their meal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10255,8123-275193-0006,the doctor was consulted and after a careful diagnosis decided there was no organic disease want of parental care want of nourishment and exposure were held responsible for jeff's unfavorable condition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10256,8123-275193-0007,it was decided to put him on a light diet of milk which proved an immediate success for within forty eight hours after his first meal the patient became as lively as possible as days and weeks went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10257,8123-275193-0008,he attached himself to each individual of the ship he had no favorites but was hail fellow well met with all he developed all the playful qualities of a puppy and reasoned out a number of problems in his own way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10258,8123-275193-0009,his particular admirers declared that he learned the meaning of the different whistles of the boatswain that he knew when the meal pennant was hoisted to the peak could tell when the crew was beat to quarters for drill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10259,8123-275193-0010,in this act of courtesy he is always accompanied by the officer of the deck and often by others that may happen to be at hand after the advent of jeff whenever i went on board the louisiana he was always at the gangway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10260,8123-275193-0011,and seemingly was deeply interested in the event it may be said of him generally that he was overflowing with spirits and took an active interest in all the daily routine work of his ship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10261,8123-275193-0012,in the gradual development of jeff's character it was discovered that he had none of the usual well known traits of the pig he was more like a petted and pampered dog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10262,8123-275193-0013,was playful good natured and expressed pleasure pain anger and desire with various squeals and grunts delivered with a variety of intonations that were very easily interpreted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10263,8123-275193-0014,he was never so happy as when in the lap of one of the sailors having his back stroked his pleasure upon those occasions was evinced by the emission of frequent good natured grunts and looking up into the face of the friendly stroker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10264,8123-275193-0015,when on shore he followed his favorites like a dog and was never known to root except in speech and appearance he was the counterpart of a happy good natured and well cared for household dog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10265,8123-275193-0016,possibly however rather more intelligent than the average canine pet the fourth of july eighteen sixty two was a gala day at roanoke island,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10266,8123-275193-0017,was made more glorious by the exchange of camp hospitalities and an indulgence in such simple hilarity as the occasion seemed to require but jeff was not forgotten early in the morning he was bathed and scrubbed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10267,8123-275193-0018,more than to his heart's content and then patriotically decorated in his right ear was a red ribbon in his left a white one around his neck another of blue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10268,8123-275193-0019,thus adorned he was brought on shore to pay me a visit and as he came through my door he appeared to be filled with the pride of patriotism and a realization of the greatness of the occasion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10269,8123-275193-0020,his reward for this unusual demonstration was instantaneous and consisted of some apples and a toothsome dessert of sugar afterward he made the round of the camps with a special escort of warrant officers and devoted jack tars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10270,8123-275193-0021,he was seen after he had run a few yards to make a great jump and then remain in his tracks the pursuing party found him actively engaged in demolishing a moccasin which he had crushed by jumping and landing with his feet upon its head and back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10271,8123-275193-0022,hogs of this particular kind are famous snake killers a big rattler or a garter snake is all the same to them they advance to the attack with the greatest impetuosity and a feast upon snake is the usual reward of exceptional bravery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10272,8123-275193-0023,jeff was a confirmed lover of good eating and in time paid the usual penalty for over indulgence of his very piggish appetite while the meal pennant was up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10273,8123-275193-0024,it was his habit to go from one fore castle mess to another and to insist upon having rather more than his share of the choice morsels from each in a short time he came to the repair shop very much the worse for wear with an impaired digestion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10274,8123-275193-0025,and a cuticle that showed unmistakable evidence of scurvy for the first he was put upon short rations for the second sand baths on shore were prescribed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10275,8123-275193-0026,under this treatment poor jeff lost all his buoyancy of spirits and his habitual friskiness and became sad and dejected but bore his troubles with patience he took to the sand baths at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10276,8123-275193-0027,and gave forth many disgruntled grunts when lifted out of them the last time i saw jeff in eighteen sixty two he was buried up to his ears in the cool sands of the roanoke island shore with eyes upturned and looking like a very sad pig,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10277,8123-275216-0000,trees but trees there were in plenty they stood everywhere from coast to coast they saw themselves reflected in all the rivers and lakes and stretched their mighty boughs up towards heaven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10278,8123-275216-0001,we are all oak trees they said we own the land and rule over it and they were right there were only a few human beings there in those days and those that there were were nothing better than wild animals,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10279,8123-275216-0002,the bear the wolf and the fox went out hunting while the stag grazed by the edge of the fen the field mouse sat outside his hole and ate acorns and the beaver built his artistic houses by the river banks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10280,8123-275216-0003,one day the bear came trudging along and lay down at full breadth under a great oak tree are you there again you robber said the oak and shook a lot of withered leaves down over him you should not squander your leaves my old friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10281,8123-275216-0004,said the bear licking his paws that is all the shade you can give against the sun if you are not pleased with me you can go answered the oak proudly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10282,8123-275216-0005,i am lord in the land and whatever way you look you find my brothers and nothing else true muttered the bear that is just what is so sickening i have been for a little tour abroad i may tell you and am just a little bit spoilt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10283,8123-275216-0006,it was in a land down towards the south there i took a nap under the beech trees they are tall slim trees not crooked old things like you and their tops are so dense that the sunbeams cannot creep through them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10284,8123-275216-0007,but i don't want to chatter any more with you just now i have had to trot a mile on account of a confounded hunter who struck me on one of my hind legs with an arrow now i should like to have a sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10285,8123-275216-0008,and perhaps you will be kind enough to leave me at peace since you cannot give me shade the bear stretched himself out and closed his eyes but he got no sleep that time for the other trees had heard his story,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10286,8123-275216-0009,what kind of trees can they be whose leaves sit so close together that the sunbeams cannot creep between them asked a little oak who was listening to what the big ones were talking about but by his side stood an old gnarled tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10287,8123-275216-0010,who gave the little oak a clout on the head with one of his lowest boughs hold your tongue he said and don't talk till you have something to talk about you need none of you believe a word of the bear's nonsense,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10288,8123-275216-0011,i will bring some beech nuts with me and i vow you will all turn yellow with jealousy when you see how pretty the new trees are then he made off but the oaks talked the whole day long one to another about the funny trees he had told them about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10289,8123-275216-0012,if they come i will kill them said the little oak tree but directly afterwards he got one on the head from the old oak if they come you shall treat them politely you young dog said he but they will not come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10290,8123-275216-0013,but in this the old oak was wrong for they did come towards autumn the bear came back and lay down under the old oak my friends down there wish me to present their compliments he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10291,8123-275216-0014,and he picked some funny things out of his shaggy coat here you may see what i have for you what is it asked the oak that is beech answered the bear the beech nuts which i promised you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10292,8123-275216-0015,they killed my wife and one of my brothers and i must see about finding a place where i can live in peace there is scarcely a spot left where a self respecting bear can stay goodbye you old gnarled oak trees,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10293,8123-275216-0016,the snow lay high over the whole land and every tree stood deep in his own thoughts and dreamt of the spring and when the spring came the grass stood green and the birds began singing where they left off last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10294,8123-275216-0017,the kings of the wood do not come till the whole company is assembled but at last they came all the leaves burst forth from the swollen buds and the trees looked at one another and complimented one another on their beauty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10295,8123-275216-0018,and every morning when the sun came out they peeped down to look for the beeches they were really a little uneasy but they were too proud to talk about it and one day the little shoots did at last burst forth from the earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10296,8123-275216-0019,the sun shone on them and the rain fell on them so it was not long before they grew tall oh how pretty they are said the great oak and stooped his crooked boughs still more so that they could get a good view of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10297,8123-275216-0020,you are welcome among us said the old oak and graciously inclined his head to them you shall be my foster children and be treated just as well as my own thanks said the little beeches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10298,8123-275216-0021,and they said no more but the little oak could not bear the strange trees it is dreadful the way you shoot up into the air he said in vexation you are already half as tall as i am but i beg you to take notice that i am much older,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10299,8123-275216-0022,and of good family besides the beeches laughed with their little tiny green leaves but said nothing shall i bend my branches a little aside so that the sun can shine better on you the old tree asked politely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10300,8123-275216-0023,many thanks answered the beeches we can grow very nicely in the shade and the whole summer passed by and another summer after that and still more summers the beeches went on growing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10301,8123-275216-0024,and at last quite overtopped the little oak keep your leaves to yourself cried the oak you overshadow me and that is what i can't endure i must have plenty of sunshine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10302,8123-275216-0025,the beeches only laughed and went on growing at last they closed together over the little oak's head and then he died that was a horrid thing to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10303,8123-275216-0026,a great oak called out and shook his boughs in terror but the old oak took his foster children under his protection it serves him right he said he is paid out for his boasting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10304,8123-275216-0027,you begin to be rather pushing the old tree said you should try to grow a little broader and stop this shooting up into the air just see where your branches are soaring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10305,8123-275216-0028,how will you be able to hold out when a regular storm comes i assure you the wind gives one's head a good shaking my old boughs have creaked many a time and what do you think will become of the flimsy finery that you stick up in the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10306,8123-275216-0029,every one has his own manner of growth and we have ours answered the young beeches this is the way it's done where we come from and we are perhaps as good as you are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10307,8123-275216-0030,that is not a polite way of speaking to an old tree with moss on his boughs said the oak i begin to repent that i was so kind to you if you have a spark of honourable feeling alive in you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10308,8123-275216-0031,be good enough to move your leaves a little to one side there have been scarcely any buds on my lowest branches this year you overshadow me so i don't quite understand how that concerns us answered the beeches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10309,8123-275216-0032,every one has quite enough to do to look after himself if he is equal to his work and has luck it turns out well for him if not he must be prepared to go to the wall that is the way of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10310,8123-275216-0033,then the oak's lowest branch died and he began to be seriously alarmed you are pretty things he said if this is the way you reward me for my hospitality when you were little i let you grow at my feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10311,8123-275216-0034,and sheltered you against the storm i let the sun shine on you as much as ever he would and i treated you as if you were my own children and in return for all this you stifle me stuff and nonsense,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10312,8123-275216-0035,said the beeches so they put forth flowers and fruit and when the fruit was ripe the wind shook the boughs and scattered it round far and wide you are quick people like me said the wind i like you for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10313,8123-275216-0036,and am glad to do you a good turn and the fox rolled on the ground at the foot of the beech trees and got his fur full of the prickly fruits and ran with them far out into the country the bear did the same,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10314,8123-275216-0037,and grinned into the bargain at the old oak while he lay and rested in the shadow of the beeches the field mouse was beside himself with joy over his new food and thought that beech nuts tasted much nicer than acorns,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10315,8123-275216-0038,all round new little beech trees shot up which grew just as fast as their parents and looked as green and as happy as if they did not know what an uneasy conscience was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10316,8123-275216-0039,but the old oak gazed sadly out over the wood the light green beech leaves were peeping out everywhere and the oaks were sighing and bewailing their distress to one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10317,8123-275216-0040,they are taking our strength out of us they said and shook as much as the beeches around would let them the land is ours no longer one bough died after another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10318,8123-275216-0041,and the storm broke them off and cast them on the ground the old oak had now only a few leaves left at the very top the end is near he said gravely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10319,8123-275216-0042,by this time there were many more human beings in the land than there were before and they made haste to hew down the oaks while there were still some remaining oak timber is better than beech timber they said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10320,8123-275216-0043,at last we get a little appreciation said the old oak but we have to pay for it with our lives then he said to the beech trees what was i thinking of when i helped you on in your young days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10321,8123-275216-0044,what an old stupid i was before that we oak trees were lords in the land and now every year i see my brothers around me perishing in the fight against you it will soon be all over with me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10322,8123-275216-0045,and not one of my acorns has sprouted under your shade but before i die i should like to know the name you give to such conduct that will not take long to say old friend answered the beeches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10323,8123-275209-0000,the butterfly's children by missus alfred gatty let me hire you as a nurse for my poor children said a butterfly to a quiet caterpillar who was strolling along a cabbage leaf in her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10324,8123-275209-0001,who will take care of my baby butterflies when i am gone will you kind mild green caterpillar but you must mind what you give them to eat caterpillar they cannot of course live on your rough food,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10325,8123-275209-0002,you must give them early dew and honey from the flowers and you must let them fly about only a little way at first for of course one can't expect them to use their wings properly all at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10326,8123-275209-0003,dear me it is a sad pity you cannot fly yourself but i have no time to look for another nurse now so you will do your best i hope dear dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10327,8123-275209-0004,and with these words the butterfly drooped her wings and died and the green caterpillar who had not had the opportunity of even saying yes or no to the request,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10328,8123-275209-0005,was left standing alone by the side of the butterfly's eggs a pretty nurse she has chosen indeed poor lady exclaimed she and a pretty business i have in hand why her senses must have left her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10329,8123-275209-0006,or she never would have asked a poor crawling creature like me to bring up her dainty little ones much they'll mind me truly when they feel the gay wings on their backs and can fly away out of my sight whenever they choose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10330,8123-275209-0007,however there lay the eggs on the cabbage leaf and the green caterpillar had a kind heart so she resolved to do her best but she got no sleep that night she was so very anxious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10331,8123-275209-0008,she made her back quite ache with walking all night round her young charges for fear any harm should happen to them and in the morning says she to herself two heads are better than one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10332,8123-275209-0009,whom should the caterpillar consult there was the shaggy dog who sometimes came into the garden but he was so rough he would most likely whisk all the eggs off the cabbage leaf with one brush of his tail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10333,8123-275209-0010,sighed the caterpillar in great distress and then she thought and thought till at last she thought of the lark and she fancied that because he went up so high and nobody knew where he went to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10334,8123-275209-0011,he must be very clever and know a great deal for to go up very high which she could never do was the caterpillar's idea of perfect glory now in the neighbouring corn field their lived a lark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10335,8123-275209-0012,and the caterpillar sent a message to him to beg him to come and talk to her and when he came she told him all her difficulties and asked him what she was to do to feed and rear the little creatures so different from herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10336,8123-275209-0013,perhaps you will be able to inquire and hear something about it next time you go up high observed the caterpillar timidly the lark said perhaps he should but he did not satisfy her curiosity any further,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10337,8123-275209-0014,soon afterwards however he went singing upwards into the bright blue sky by degrees his voice died away in the distance till the green caterpillar could not hear a sound,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10338,8123-275209-0015,so she resumed her walk round the butterfly's eggs nibbling a bit of the cabbage leaf now and then as she moved along,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10339,8123-275209-0016,i believe everything i am told observed the caterpillar hastily well then first of all i will tell you what these little creatures are to eat what do you think it is to be guess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10340,8123-275209-0017,dew and the honey out of flowers i am afraid sighed the caterpillar no such thing old lady something simpler than that something that you can get at quite easily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10341,8123-275209-0018,never said the caterpillar indignantly it was their dying mother's last request that i should do no such thing their dying mother knew nothing about the matter persisted the lark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10342,8123-275209-0019,but why do you ask me and then disbelieve what i say you have neither faith nor trust oh i believe everything i am told said the caterpillar nay but you do not replied the lark you won't believe me even about the food,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10343,8123-275209-0020,and yet that is but a beginning of what i have to tell you why caterpillar what do you think those little eggs will turn out to be butterflies to be sure said the caterpillar caterpillars sang the lark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10344,8123-275209-0021,but i find that he is foolish and saucy instead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10345,8123-275209-0022,i would tell you if you would believe me sang the lark descending once more i believe everything i am told reiterated the caterpillar with as grave a face as if it were a fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10346,8123-275209-0023,then i'll tell you something else cried the lark for the best of my news remains behind you will one day be a butterfly yourself wretched bird exclaimed the caterpillar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10347,8123-275209-0024,you jest with my inferiority now you are cruel as well as foolish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10348,8123-275209-0025,i will ask your advice no more i told you you would not believe me cried the lark nettled in his turn i believe everything that i am told persisted the caterpillar that is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10349,8123-275209-0026,i see so many wonderful things i know no reason why there should not be more oh caterpillar it is because you crawl because you never get beyond your cabbage leaf that you call any thing impossible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10350,8123-275209-0027,as well as you do look at my long green body and these endless legs and then talk to me about having wings and a painted feathery coat fool and fool you cried the indignant lark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10351,8123-275209-0028,oh caterpillar what comes to you from thence receive as i do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10352,8123-275209-0029,interrupted the lark how am i to learn faith asked the caterpillar at that moment she felt something at her side she looked round eight or ten little green caterpillars were moving about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10353,8123-275209-0030,and had already made a show of a hole in the cabbage leaf they had broken from the butterfly's eggs shame and amazement filled our green friend's heart but joy soon followed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10354,8123-275209-0031,for as the first wonder was possible the second might be so too teach me your lesson lark she would say and the lark sang to her of the wonders of the earth below and of the heaven above,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10355,8123-275209-0032,and the caterpillar talked all the rest of her life to her relations of the time when she should be a butterfly but none of them believed her she nevertheless had learnt the lark's lesson of faith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10356,8123-275209-0033,and when she was going into her chrysalis grave she said i shall be a butterfly some day but her relations thought her head was wandering and they said poor thing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10357,8123-275209-0034,and when she was a butterfly and was going to die again she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10358,7794-295955-0000,then the middle son went hunting and as he issued from the town a hare sprang out of a bush and the prince after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into the water mill and the prince after it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10359,7794-295955-0001,but it was not a hare but a dragon which waited for and devoured him when some days had elapsed and the princes did not return either of them the whole court was in sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10360,7794-295955-0002,then the third son went hunting to see whether he could not find his brothers when he issued from the town again up sprang a hare out of a bush and the prince after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into the water mill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10361,7794-295955-0003,but the prince did not choose to follow it but went to find other game saying to himself when i return i shall find you after thus he went for a long time up and down the hill but found nothing and then returned to the water mill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10362,7794-295955-0004,she replied my son that was not a hare but a dragon it kills and throttles many people hearing this the prince was somewhat disturbed and said to the old woman what shall we do now doubtless my two brothers also have perished here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10363,7794-295955-0005,the old woman answered they have indeed but there's no help for it go home my son lest you follow them then he said to her dear old woman do you know what i know that you will be glad to liberate yourself from that pest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10364,7794-295955-0006,the old woman interrupted him how should i not it captured me too in this way but now i have no means of escape then he proceeded listen well to what i am going to say to you ask it whither it goes and where its strength is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10365,7794-295955-0007,when the dragon came in the old woman began to question it where in god's name have you been whither do you go so far you will never tell me whither you go the dragon replied well my dear old woman i do go far,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10366,7794-295955-0008,my strength is a long way off and you cannot go thither far in another empire under the emperor's city is a lake in that lake is a dragon and in that dragon a boar and in the boar a pigeon and in that is my strength,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10367,7794-295955-0009,took a shepherd's staff in his hand and went into the world as he went on thus from village to village and from town to town at last he came into another empire and into the imperial city in a lake under which the dragon was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10368,7794-295955-0010,on going into the town he began to inquire who wanted a shepherd the citizens told him that the emperor did then he went straight to the emperor after he announced himself the emperor admitted him into his presence and asked him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10369,7794-295955-0011,and when you call the sheep out they go thither at once and spread themselves round the lake but whatever shepherd goes off there that shepherd returns back no more therefore my son i tell you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10370,7794-295955-0012,don't let the sheep have their own way and go where they will but keep them where you will the prince thanked the emperor got himself ready and called out the sheep taking with him more over two hounds that could catch a boar in the open country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10371,7794-295955-0013,and the hounds and bagpipes under the stump then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the lake and began to shout dragon dragon come out to single combat with me to day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10372,7794-295955-0014,let me go prince that i may moisten my parched head in the lake and toss you to the sky but the prince replied come dragon don't talk nonsense if i had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead i would toss you still higher,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10373,7794-295955-0015,because he had come whereas previously no shepherd had been able to come from the lake the next day the prince got ready again and went with his sheep straight to the lake but the emperor sent two grooms after him to go stealthily and see what he did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10374,7794-295955-0016,and they placed themselves on a high hill whence they could have a good view when the shepherd arrived he put the hounds and bagpipes under the stump and the falcon upon it then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the lake and shouted dragon dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10375,7794-295955-0017,come out to single combat with me that we may measure ourselves once more together unless you are a woman the dragon replied i will do so prince now now erelong behold the dragon it was large it was terrible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10376,7794-295955-0018,it was disgusting and it seized him by the waist and wrestled with him a summer's day till afternoon but when the afternoon heat came on the dragon said let me go prince that i may moisten my parched head in the lake and may toss you to the sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10377,7794-295955-0019,when night approached the prince drove the sheep as before and went home playing the bagpipes when he arrived at the town the whole town was astir and began to wonder because the shepherd came home every evening which no one had been able to do before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10378,7794-295955-0020,those two grooms had already arrived at the palace before the prince and related to the emperor in order everything that they had heard and seen now when the emperor saw that the shepherd returned home he immediately summoned his daughter into his presence and told her all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10379,7794-295955-0021,and i am your only daughter and you don't care about me if i perish then the emperor began to persuade and encourage her don't fear my daughter you see we have had so many changes of shepherds and of all that went out to the lake not one has returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10380,7794-295955-0022,so many people when on the morrow the day dawned and the sun came forth up rose the shepherd up rose the maiden too to begin to prepare for going to the lake the shepherd was cheerful more cheerful than ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10381,7794-295955-0023,but the emperor's daughter was sad and shed tears the shepherd comforted her lady sister i pray you do not weep but do what i tell you when it is time run up and kiss me and fear not as he went and drove the sheep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10382,7794-295955-0024,when they arrived at the lake the sheep immediately spread round it and the prince placed the falcon on the stump and the hounds and bagpipes under it then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the water and shouted dragon dragon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10383,7794-295955-0025,the prince replied come dragon don't talk nonsense if i had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead i would toss you much higher when he said this the emperor's daughter ran up and kissed him on the face on the eye and on the forehead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10384,7794-295955-0026,then he swung the dragon and tossed it high into the air and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces but as it burst into pieces out of it sprang a wild boar and started to run away but the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10385,7794-295955-0027,hold it don't let it go and the dogs sprang up and after it caught it and soon tore it to pieces but out of the boar flew a pigeon and the prince loosed the falcon and the falcon caught the pigeon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10386,7794-295955-0028,cut these three wands up from below and strike with them upon their root an iron door will immediately open into a large vault in that vault are many people old and young rich and poor small and great wives and maidens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10387,7794-295955-0029,so that you could settle a populous empire there too are your brothers when the pigeon had told him all this the prince immediately wrung its neck the emperor had gone out in person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10388,7794-295955-0030,he washed himself nicely took the falcon on his shoulder the hounds behind him and the bagpipes under his arm played as he went drove the sheep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10389,7794-295955-0031,when they came to the town all the town assembled as to see a wonder the emperor who had seen all his heroism from the hill called him into his presence and gave him his daughter went immediately to church had them married and held a wedding festival for a week,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10390,7794-295947-0000,on the same errand as themselves as soon as the children saw the foxes they picked up a bamboo stick and took the creatures stealthily in the rear and when the old foxes took to flight they surrounded them and beat them with the stick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10391,7794-295947-0001,so that they ran away as fast as their legs could carry them but two of the boys held down the cub and seizing it by the scruff of the neck went off in high glee the two friends were looking on all the while and one of them raising his voice shouted out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10392,7794-295947-0002,hallo you boys what are you doing with that fox the eldest of the boys replied we're going to take him home and sell him to a young man in our village he'll buy him and then he'll boil him in a pot and eat him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10393,7794-295947-0003,well replied the other after considering the matter attentively i suppose it's all the same to you whom you sell him to you'd better let me have him oh but the young man from our village promised us a good sum if we could find a fox,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10394,7794-295947-0004,and got us to come out to the hills and catch one and so we can't sell him to you at any price well i suppose it cannot be helped then but how much would the young man give you for the cub oh he'll give us three hundred cash at least,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10395,7794-295947-0005,and gave half a bu to the three boys who ran away delighted the man's friend upon this said to him well certainly you have got queer tastes what on earth are you going to keep the fox for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10396,7794-295947-0006,how could i stand by and see life taken it was but a little i spent only half a bu to save the cub but had it cost a fortune i should not have grudged it i thought you were intimate enough with me to know my heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10397,7794-295947-0007,but to day you have accused me of being eccentric and i see how mistaken i have been in you however our friendship shall cease from this day forth and when he had said this with a great deal of firmness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10398,7794-295947-0008,the other retiring backward and bowing with his hands on his knees replied indeed indeed i am filled with admiration at the goodness of your heart when i hear you speak thus i feel more than ever how great is the love i bear you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10399,7794-295947-0009,so they stroked it gently on the back and petted it and as the pain of the wound seemed to have subsided they were admiring the properties of the herb when opposite to them they saw the old foxes sitting watching them by the side of some stacks of rice straw,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10400,7794-295947-0010,look there the old foxes have come back out of fear for their cub's safety come we will set it free and with these words they untied the string round the cub's neck and turned its head toward the spot where the old foxes sat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10401,7794-295947-0011,so with peace in their hearts the latter went off to another place and choosing a pretty spot produced the wine bottle and ate their noonday meal and after a pleasant day they returned to their homes and became firmer friends than ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10402,7794-295947-0012,now the man who had rescued the fox's cub was a tradesman in good circumstances he had three or four agents and two maid servants besides men servants and altogether he lived in a liberal manner he was married and this union had brought him one son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10403,7794-295947-0013,even though our child should die for it they said we will not ourselves deprive other creatures of their lives but you who live among the hills are sure to hear when your neighbours go out fox hunting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10404,7794-295947-0014,we don't care what price we might have to pay for a fox's liver pray buy one for us at any expense so they pressed him to exert himself on their behalf and he having promised faithfully to execute the commission went his way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10405,7794-295947-0015,in the night of the following day there came a messenger who announced himself as coming from the person who had undertaken to procure the fox's liver so the master of the house went out to see him i have come from mister so and so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10406,7794-295947-0016,last night the fox's liver that you required fell into his hands so he sent me to bring it to you with these words the messenger produced a small jar adding in a few days he will let you know the price,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10407,7794-295947-0017,when he had delivered his message the master of the house was greatly pleased and said indeed i am deeply grateful for this kindness which will save my son's life then the good wife came out and received the jar with every mark of politeness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10408,7794-295947-0018,we must make a present to the messenger indeed sir i've already been paid for my trouble well at any rate you must stop the night here thank you sir i've a relation in the next village whom i have not seen for a long while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10409,7794-295947-0019,and i will pass the night with him and so he took his leave and went away the parents lost no time in sending to let the physician know that they had procured the fox's liver the next day the doctor came and compounded a medicine for the patient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10410,7794-295947-0020,which at once produced a good effect and there was no little joy in the household as luck would have it three days after this the man whom they had commissioned to buy the fox's liver came to the house so the goodwife hurried out to meet him and welcome him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10411,7794-295947-0021,how quickly you fulfilled our wishes and how kind of you to send at once the doctor prepared the medicine and now our boy can get up and walk about the room and it's all owing to your goodness wait a bit cried the guest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10412,7794-295947-0022,who did not know what to make of the joy of the two parents the commission with which you entrusted me about the fox's liver turned out to be a matter of impossibility so i came to day to make my excuses and now i really can't understand what you are so grateful to me for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10413,7794-295947-0023,pray inquire carefully into the matter well this is very strange four nights ago a man of some five or six and thirty years of age came with a verbal message from you to the effect that you had sent him with a fox's liver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10414,7794-295947-0024,which you had just procured and said that he would come and tell us the price another day when we asked him to spend the night here he answered that he would lodge with a relation in the next village and went away the visitor was more and more lost in amazement and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10415,7794-295947-0025,last spring when i was taking out my cub to play it was carried off by some boys and only saved by your goodness the desire to requite this kindness pierced me to the quick at last when calamity attacked your house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10416,7794-295947-0026,i thought i might be of use to you your son's illness could not be cured without a liver taken from a live fox so to repay your kindness i killed my cub and took out its liver then its sire disguising himself as a messenger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10417,7794-295947-0027,brought it to your house and as she spoke the fox shed tears and the master of the house wishing to thank her moved in bed upon which his wife awoke and asked him what was the matter but he too to her great astonishment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10418,7794-295947-0028,was biting the pillow and weeping bitterly why are you weeping thus asked she at last he sat up in bed and said last spring when i was out on a pleasure excursion i was the means of saving the life of a fox's cub,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10419,7794-295947-0029,as i told you at the time the other day i told mister so and so that although my son were to die before my eyes i would not be the means of killing a fox on purpose but asked him in case he heard of any hunter killing a fox,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10420,7794-295947-0030,to buy it for me how the foxes came to hear of this i don't know but the foxes to whom i had shown kindness killed their own cub and took out the liver and the old dog fox disguising himself as a messenger from the person to whom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10422,7794-295947-0032,when she heard this the goodwife likewise was blinded by her tears and for a while they lay lost in thought but at last coming to themselves they lighted the lamp on the shelf on which the family idol stood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10423,7794-295947-0033,and spent the night in reciting prayers and praises and the next day they published the matter to the household and to their relations and friends now although there are instances of men killing their own children to requite a favour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10424,7794-295947-0034,there is no other example of foxes having done such a thing so the story became the talk of the whole country now the boy who had recovered through the efficacy of this medicine selected the prettiest spot on the premises,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10443,7794-295948-0006,after two hours the badger took its leave with profuse expressions of thanks and went out and from that time forth it came every night to the hut as the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches and dead leaves from the hills for firewood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10444,7794-295948-0007,the priest at last became very friendly with it and got used to its company so that if ever as the night wore on the badger did not arrive he used to miss it and wonder why it did not come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10445,7794-295948-0008,and even after my death i must remember them what can i do to requite them if there is anything that you wish for pray tell me the priest smiling at this speech answered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10447,7794-295948-0010,you shall be welcome here the badger on hearing this could not conceal its admiration of the depth of the old man's benevolence but having so much to be grateful for it felt hurt at not being able to requite it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10448,7794-295948-0011,as this subject was often renewed between them the priest at last touched by the goodness of the badger's heart said since i have shaven my head renounced the world and forsaken the pleasures of this life i have no desire to gratify,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10449,7794-295948-0012,yet i own i should like to possess three riyos in gold food and raiment i receive by the favour of the villagers so i take no heed for those things were i to die to morrow and attain my wish of being born again into the next world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10450,7794-295948-0013,the same kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body thus although i have no other reason to wish for money still if i had three riyos i would offer them up at some holy shrine that masses and prayers might be said for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10451,7794-295948-0014,whereby i might enter into salvation yet i would not get this money by violent or unlawful means i only think of what might be if i had it so you see since you have expressed such kind feelings toward me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10452,7794-295948-0015,i have told you what is on my mind when the priest had done speaking the badger leant its head on one side with a puzzled and anxious look so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a wish which seemed to give the beast trouble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10453,7794-295948-0016,and tried to retract what he had said posthumous honours after all are the wish of ordinary men i who am a priest ought not to entertain such thoughts or to want money so pray pay no attention to what i have said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10454,7794-295948-0017,and the badger feigning assent to what the priest had impressed upon it returned to the hills as usual from that time forth the badger came no more to the hut,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10455,7794-295948-0018,the priest thought this very strange but imagined either that the badger stayed away because it did not like to come without the money or that it had been killed in an attempt to steal it and he blamed himself for having added to his sins for no purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10456,7794-295948-0019,repenting when it was too late persuaded however that the badger must have been killed he passed his time in putting up prayers upon prayers for it after three years had gone by one night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10457,7794-295948-0020,the old man heard a voice near his door calling out your reverence your reverence as the voice was like that of the badger he jumped up as soon as he heard it and ran to open the door and there sure enough was the badger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10458,7794-295948-0021,if the money which you required had been for unlawful purposes i could easily have procured as much as ever you might have wanted but when i heard that it was to be offered to a temple for masses for your soul,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10459,7794-295948-0022,fused it afresh in the fire and at this work i spent months and days as the badger finished speaking the priest looked at the money which it had produced and sure enough he saw that it was bright and new and clean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10460,7794-295948-0023,as he was thanking the badger with great politeness and ceremony the beast said in doing this i have but fulfilled my own wish still i hope that you will tell this thing to no man indeed replied the priest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10461,7794-295948-0024,but i shall say that the badger that gave me the money has ceased coming to my hut you need not fear being waylaid but can come as of old and shelter yourself from the cold to this the badger nodded assent and as long as the old priest lived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10462,7794-295948-0025,it came and spent the winter nights with him from this story it is plain that even beasts have a sense of gratitude in this quality dogs excel all other beasts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10471,2007-149877-0007,particularly among those who had not yet reached but hoped to do so the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented you don't say so would be the reply why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10499,2007-149877-0035,as was considered proper and hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer what's become of caryoe remarked hurstwood i haven't seen him around here in two weeks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10501,2007-149877-0037,no he can't injure that any i guess hurstwood was standing his coat open his thumbs in his pockets the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness he was the picture of fastidious comfort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10502,2007-149877-0038,to one not inclined to drink and gifted with a more serious turn of mind such a bubbling chattering glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly a strange commentary on nature and life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10503,2007-149877-0039,here come the moths in endless procession to bask in the light of the flame such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10504,2007-149877-0040,it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save formalities where the sharp eared may hear and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10505,2007-149877-0041,nevertheless the fact that here men gather here chatter here love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10506,2007-149877-0042,the many friends he met here dropped in because they craved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10507,2007-149877-0043,the company the glow the atmosphere which they found one might take it after all as an augur of the better social order for the things which they satisfied here though sensory were not evil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10508,2007-149877-0044,no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber the worst effect of such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the material minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10509,2007-149877-0045,in the last analysis that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations but rather of the innate trend of the mind that such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10510,2007-149877-0046,could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of liquor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10511,2007-149877-0047,and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10512,2007-149877-0048,the dressy greedy company the small self interested palaver the disorganized aimless wandering mental action which it represents the love of light and show and finery which to one outside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10513,2007-149877-0049,under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing under the stars and sweeping night winds what a lamp flower it must bloom a,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10520,2007-149877-0056,said drouet mentioning the popular farce of the time well you'd better be going it's half after eight already and he drew out his watch the crowd was already thinning out considerably,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10533,2007-132570-0007,well well said emily impatiently and anxious to enquire on another subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10534,2007-132570-0008,yes he did indeed ma'amselle notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10535,2007-132570-0009,and he mistook ludovico's hall for old carlo's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10536,2007-132570-0010,so we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room but the signor was as cunning as the best of us and kept calling out at the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10537,2007-132570-0011,come forth my valorous signor steward just then old carlo opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand for as soon as the signor saw him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10538,2007-132570-0012,he was as tame as could be and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his basket all this i saw through the key hole well annette said ludovico jeeringly shall i let you out now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10539,2007-132570-0013,interrupted emily quite wearied by this story do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10540,2007-132570-0014,but it is expected back to night or to morrow and i shall know then perhaps emily enquired if she had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners ah ma'amselle said annette archly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10541,2007-132570-0015,now i dare say you are thinking of monsieur valancourt and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state and that he has met with some of our people and is taken captive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10542,2007-132570-0016,o lord how glad i should be if it was so would you indeed be glad said emily in a tone of mournful reproach to be sure i should,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10543,2007-132570-0017,ma'am replied annette and would not you be glad too to see signor valancourt i don't know any chevalier i like better i have a very great regard for the signor truly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10544,2007-132570-0018,your regard for him cannot be doubted said emily since you wish to see him a prisoner why no ma'amselle not a prisoner either but one must be glad to see him you know and it was only the other night i dreamt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10545,2007-132570-0019,and then it was gone and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls so they helped one another up again as fast as they could you would not believe ma'amselle though i shewed you the very cannon where it used to appear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10546,2007-132570-0020,and are you indeed so simple annette said emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories credit them ma'amselle why,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10547,2007-132570-0021,all the world could not persuade me out of them roberto and sebastian and half a dozen more of them went into fits to be sure there was no occasion for that i said myself there was no need of that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10548,2007-132570-0022,for says i when the enemy comes what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down in fits all of a row the enemy won't be so civil perhaps as to walk off like the ghost and leave them to help one another up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10549,2007-132570-0023,but will fall to cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men no no says i there is reason in all things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10550,2007-132570-0024,being because it is no business of mine to look gruff and fight battles emily endeavoured to correct the superstitious weakness of annette though she could not entirely subdue her own to which the latter only replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10551,2007-132570-0025,nay ma'amselle you will believe nothing you are almost as bad as the signor himself who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret this was a hard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10552,2007-132570-0026,but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so than you have ma'am emily looked displeased and made no reply as she mused upon the recollected appearance which had lately so much alarmed her and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10553,2007-132570-0027,opposite to her casement she was for a moment inclined to believe it was valancourt whom she had seen yet if it was he why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so and if he was a prisoner in the castle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10554,2007-132570-0028,and he could be here in no other character how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10555,2007-132570-0029,were the same or if they were whether this was valancourt she however desired that annette would endeavour to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names o dear ma'amselle said annette i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10556,2007-132570-0030,the ladies as they call themselves who are lately come to udolpho why that signora livona that the signor brought to see my late lady at venice is his mistress now and was little better then i dare say and ludovico says,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10557,2007-132570-0031,but pray be secret ma'am that his excellenza introduced her only to impose upon the world that had begun to make free with her character so when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10558,2007-132570-0032,but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady's death too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10559,2007-132570-0033,but she cannot hear them now poor soul said i emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired annette to go and make enquiry concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10560,2007-132570-0034,but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name or that of monsieur valancourt now i think of it ma'amselle said annette i do believe there are prisoners for i overheard one of the signor's men yesterday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10561,2007-132570-0035,and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellenza to catch up men and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10562,2007-132570-0036,because said he we don't go shares there this information heightened emily's impatience to know more and annette immediately departed on her enquiry the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10563,2007-132570-0037,the possibility that valancourt was near her revived her fortitude and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoni requiring her attendance in the cedar parlour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10564,2007-132570-0038,which she obeyed with trembling and on her way thither endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of valancourt montoni was alone i sent for you said he to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10565,2007-132570-0039,i will condescend to advise where i may command,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10566,2007-132570-0040,if i have no right in these estates sir said emily of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them if the lands are yours by law you certainly may possess them without my interference or my consent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10567,2007-132570-0041,i will have no more argument said montoni with a look that made her tremble what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby but i will be trifled with no longer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10568,2007-132570-0042,let the recollection of your aunt's sufferings in consequence of her folly and obstinacy teach you a lesson sign the papers emily's resolution was for a moment awed she shrunk at the recollections he revived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10569,2007-132570-0043,and from the vengeance he threatened but then the image of valancourt who so long had loved her and who was now perhaps so near her came to her heart and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10570,2007-132570-0044,from her infancy regarded an act of injustice inspired her with a noble though imprudent courage sign the papers said montoni more impatiently than before never sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10571,2007-132570-0045,replied emily that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right montoni turned pale with anger while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10572,2007-132570-0046,then all my vengeance falls upon you he exclaimed with an horrible oath and think not it shall be delayed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10573,2007-132570-0047,you have dared to question my right now dare to question my power i have a punishment which you think not of it is terrible this night this very night' this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10574,2007-132570-0048,night repeated another voice montoni paused and turned half round but seeming to recollect himself he proceeded in a lower tone you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10575,2007-132570-0049,yet this it appears has not been sufficient to deter you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10576,2007-132570-0050,i could make you tremble at the bare recital he was interrupted by a groan which seemed to rise from underneath the chamber they were in and as he threw a glance round it impatience and rage flashed from his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10577,2007-132570-0051,yet something like a shade of fear passed over his countenance emily sat down in a chair near the door for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her but montoni paused scarcely an instant and commanding his features,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10578,2007-132570-0052,resumed his discourse in a lower yet sterner voice i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10579,2007-132570-0053,i could tell you that when once my resolution is taken but i am talking to a baby let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples i could recite the recital could not now benefit you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10580,2007-132570-0054,for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition it would not now appease my indignation i will have vengeance as well as justice another groan filled the pause which montoni made,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10581,2007-132570-0055,leave the room instantly said he seeming not to notice this strange occurrence without power to implore his pity she rose to go but found that she could not support herself awe and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10582,2007-132570-0056,quit my presence cried montoni this affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation did you hear nothing signor said emily trembling and still unable to leave the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10583,2007-132570-0057,i heard my own voice rejoined montoni sternly and nothing else,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10584,2007-132570-0058,obey my order repeated montoni and for these fool's tricks i will soon discover by whom they are practised emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10585,2007-132570-0059,but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence passed to the ramparts as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement emily saw a party of montoni's troops winding down a distant mountain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10586,2007-132570-0060,whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were perhaps bringing to the castle at length having reached her apartment she threw herself upon the couch overcome with the new horrors of her situation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10587,8838-298545-0000,he sat in silence with his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his hands outside through the grimy surgery window over a foreground of blackened brick and slate a line of enormous chimneys like cyclopean pillars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10588,8838-298545-0001,upheld the lowering dun coloured cloud bank for six days in the week they spouted smoke but to day the furnace fires were banked for it was sunday sordid and polluting gloom hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10589,8838-298545-0002,he should be back again at the university completing the last year which would give him his medical degree but alas he had not the money with which to pay his class fees nor could he imagine how he could procure it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10590,8838-298545-0003,he was roused from his black meditation by the entrance of doctor oldacre himself a large clean shaven respectable man with a prim manner and an austere face he had prospered exceedingly by the support of the local church interest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10591,8838-298545-0004,and the rule of his life was never by word or action to run a risk of offending the sentiment which had made him his standard of respectability and of dignity was exceedingly high and he expected the same from his assistants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10592,8838-298545-0005,his appearance and words were always vaguely benevolent a sudden impulse came over the despondent student he would test the reality of this philanthropy i beg your pardon doctor oldacre said he rising from his chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10593,8838-298545-0006,i have a great favour to ask of you the doctor's appearance was not encouraging his mouth suddenly tightened and his eyes fell yes mister montgomery you are aware sir that i need only one more session to complete my course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10594,8838-298545-0007,i am afraid that my duties call me elsewhere mister montgomery one moment sir i had hoped sir that perhaps if i signed a paper promising you interest upon your money you would advance this sum to me i will pay you back sir i really will or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10595,8838-298545-0008,if you like i will work it off after i am qualified the doctor's lips had thinned into a narrow line his eyes were raised again and sparkled indignantly your request is unreasonable mister montgomery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10596,8838-298545-0009,consider sir how many thousands of medical students there are in this country no doubt there are many of them who have a difficulty in finding their fees am i to provide for them all or why should i make an exception in your favour i am grieved and disappointed mister montgomery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10597,8838-298545-0010,that you should have put me into the painful position of having to refuse you he turned upon his heel and walked with offended dignity out of the surgery the student smiled bitterly and turned to his work of making up the morning prescriptions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10598,8838-298545-0011,he only excelled in his strength and where was he to find a customer for that but the ways of fate are strange and his customer was at hand look y'ere said a voice at the door montgomery looked up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10599,8838-298545-0012,for the voice was a loud and rasping one a young man stood at the entrance a stocky bull necked young miner in tweed sunday clothes and an aggressive neck tie he was a sinister looking figure with dark insolent eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10600,8838-298545-0013,and the jaw and throat of a bulldog look y'ere said he again why hast thou not sent t medicine oop as thy master ordered montgomery had become accustomed to the brutal frankness of the northern worker at first it had enraged him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10601,8838-298545-0014,but after a time he had grown callous to it and accepted it as it was meant but this was something different it was insolence brutal overbearing insolence with physical menace behind it what name he asked coldly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10602,8838-298545-0015,the provocation was so gross the insult so unprovoked that he could have none of those qualms which take the edge off a man's mettle he finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10603,8838-298545-0016,look here said he turning round to the miner your medicine will be made up in its turn and sent down to you i don't allow folk in the surgery wait outside in the waiting room if you wish to wait at all yoong man said the miner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10604,8838-298545-0017,the blows were almost simultaneous a savage swing which whistled past montgomery's ear and a straight drive which took the workman on the chin luck was with the assistant that single whizzing uppercut and the way in which it was delivered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10605,8838-298545-0018,had enough asked the assistant breathing fiercely through his nose but no answer came the man was insensible and then the danger of his position came upon montgomery and he turned as white as his antagonist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10606,8838-298545-0019,a sunday the immaculate doctor oldacre with his pious connection a savage brawl with a patient he would irretrievably lose his situation if the facts came out it was not much of a situation but he could not get another without a reference,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10607,8838-298545-0020,loosened his collar and squeezed the surgery sponge over his face he sat up at last with a gasp and a scowl domn thee thou's spoilt my neck tie said he mopping up the water from his breast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10608,8838-298545-0021,i'm sorry i hit you so hard said montgomery apologetically thou hit me hard i could stan such fly flappin all day twas this here press that cracked my pate for me and thou art a looky man to be able to boast as thou hast outed me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10609,8838-298545-0022,and now i'd be obliged to thee if thou wilt give me t wife's medicine montgomery gladly made it up and handed it to the miner you are weak still said he won't you stay awhile and rest t wife wants her medicine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10610,8838-298545-0023,said the man and lurched out at the door the assistant looking after him saw him rolling with an uncertain step down the street until a friend met him and they walked on arm in arm the man seemed in his rough northern fashion to bear no grudge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10611,8838-298545-0024,yet all day he was aware of a sense of vague uneasiness which sharpened into dismay when late in the afternoon he was informed that three gentlemen had called and were waiting for him in the surgery a coroner's inquest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10612,8838-298545-0025,above all what they could expect from him was a most inexplicable problem the first was sorley wilson the son of the owner of the nonpareil coalpit he was a young blood of twenty heir to a fortune a keen sportsman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10613,8838-298545-0026,and down for the easter vacation from magdalene college he sat now upon the edge of the surgery table looking in thoughtful silence at montgomery and twisting the ends of his small black waxed moustache the second was purvis the publican,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10614,8838-298545-0027,and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair a fat red hand upon either knee and stared critically at the young assistant so did the third visitor fawcett the horse breaker who leaned back his long thin legs with their boxcloth riding gaiters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10615,8838-298545-0028,no it's off it's nowt stand oop lad let's see thee standin it was the publican who spoke montgomery obeyed he would learn all about it no doubt if he were patient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10616,8838-298545-0029,a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty if he's an ounce well the master doesn't scale much more than that a hundred and seventy five that was when he was hog fat and living high work the grease out of him and i lay there's no great difference between them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10617,8838-298545-0030,have you been weighed lately mister montgomery it was the first direct question which had been asked him he had stood in the midst of them like a horse at a fair and he was just beginning to wonder whether he was more angry or amused i am just eleven stone said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10618,8838-298545-0031,but trainin for everyday work ain't the same as trainin with a trainer and i dare bet with all respec to your opinion mister wilson that there's half a stone of tallow on him at this minute the young cantab put his fingers on the assistant's upper arm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10619,8838-298545-0032,then with his other hand on his wrist he bent the forearm sharply and felt the biceps as round and hard as a cricket ball spring up under his fingers feel that said he the publican and horse breaker felt it with an air of reverence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10620,8838-298545-0033,good lad he'll do yet cried purvis gentlemen said montgomery i think that you will acknowledge that i have boon very patient with you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10621,8838-298545-0034,and now i must really beg that you will have the goodness to tell me what is the matter they all sat down in their serious business like way that's easy done mister montgomery said the fat voiced publican but before sayin anything we had to wait and see whether,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10622,8838-298545-0035,for it would be somethin new to find isaac fawcett as a spoil sport well then we will make up the hundred for the stake among us and the fight stands always supposin the young man is willin excuse all this rot mister montgomery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10623,8838-298545-0036,said the university man in a genial voice we've begun at the wrong end i know but we'll soon straighten it out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10624,8838-298545-0037,you remember the man whom you knocked out this morning he is barton the famous ted barton i'm sure sir you may well be proud to have outed him in one round said the publican why it took morris the ten stone six champion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10625,8838-298545-0038,a deal more trouble than that before he put barton to sleep you've done a fine performance sir and happen you'll do a finer if you give yourself the chance i never heard of ted barton beyond seeing the name on a medicine label said the assistant well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10626,8838-298545-0039,you may take it from me that he's a slaughterer said the horse breaker you've taught him a lesson that he needed for it was always a word and a blow with him and the word alone was worth five shillin in a public court he won't be so ready now to shake his nief in the face of everyone he meets,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10627,8838-298545-0040,however that's neither here nor there montgomery looked at them in bewilderment for goodness sake gentlemen tell me what it is you want me to do he cried we want you to fight silas craggs better known as the master of croxley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10628,8838-298545-0041,but why because ted barton was to have fought him next saturday he was the champion of the wilson coal pits and the other was the master of the iron folk down at the croxley smelters we'd matched our man for a purse of a hundred against the master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10629,8838-298545-0042,but you've queered our man and he can't face such a battle with a two inch cut at the back of his head there's only one thing to be done sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10630,8838-298545-0043,if you can lick ted barton you may lick the master of croxley but if you don't we're done for there's no one else who is in the same street with him in this district it's twenty rounds two ounce gloves queensberry rules and a decision on points if you fight to the finish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10631,8838-298545-0044,for a moment the absurdity of the thing drove every other thought out of montgomery's head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10632,8838-298545-0045,all he wanted to complete his education was lying there ready to his hand if only that hand were strong enough to pick it up he had thought bitterly that morning that there was no market for his strength,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10633,8838-298545-0046,than his brains in a year but a chill of doubt came over him how can i fight for the coal pits said he i am not connected with them eh lad but thou art cried old purvis we've got it down in writin and it's clear enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10634,8838-298545-0047,it would be a very sporting thing of you mister montgomery if you would come to our help when we are in such a hole of course you might not like to take the hundred pounds but i have no doubt that in the case of your winning we could arrange that it should take the form of a watch or piece of plate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10635,8838-298545-0048,or any other shape which might suggest itself to you you see you are responsible for our having lost our champion so we really feel that we have a claim upon you give me a moment gentlemen it is very unexpected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10636,8838-298545-0049,i am afraid the doctor would never consent to my going in fact i am sure that he would not but he need never know not before the fight at any rate we are not bound to give the name of our man so long as he is within the weight limits on the day of the fight that is all that concerns anyone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10637,8838-298545-0050,thou'll rise in one day from being just a common doctor to the best known mon twixt here and bradford thou art a witherin tyke thou art and no mistake and if thou beat the master of croxley thou'll find all the beer thou want for the rest of thy life waiting for thee at the four sacks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10638,8838-298545-0051,it is the most sporting thing i ever heard of in my life said young wilson by george sir if you pull it off you've got the constituency in your pocket if you care to stand you know the out house in my garden next the road exactly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10639,8838-298545-0052,then you'll want a sparring partner ogilvy has been acting for barton but we don't think that he is class enough barton bears you no grudge he's a good hearted fellow though cross grained with strangers he looked upon you as a stranger this morning but he says he knows you now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10640,8838-298546-0000,it was true that his teacher was long past his prime slow upon his feet and stiff in his joints but even so he was still a tough antagonist but montgomery had found at last that he could more than hold his own with him he had won the university medal and his teacher,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10641,8838-298546-0001,in which he had the worst of it but had made the prize fighter stretch himself to the uttermost there was his whole record and was it enough to encourage him to stand up to the master of croxley he had never heard of the master before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10642,8838-298546-0002,but then he had lost touch of the ring during the last few years of hard work after all what did it matter if he won there was the money which meant so much to him if he lost it would only mean a thrashing he could take punishment without flinching of that he was certain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10643,8838-298546-0003,matched against a pugilist over at croxley i cannot understand why the law does not step in and stop so degrading an exhibition it is really a prize fight a glove fight you said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10644,8838-298546-0004,i am informed that a two oz glove is an evasion by which they dodge the law and make it difficult for the police to interfere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10645,8838-298546-0005,to think that such scenes can be enacted within a few miles of our peaceful home but you will realise mister montgomery that while there are such influences for us to counteract it is very necessary that we should live up to our highest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10646,8838-298546-0006,the doctor's sermon would have had more effect if the assistant had not once or twice had occasion to test his highest and come upon it at unexpectedly humble elevations it is always so particularly easy to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10647,8838-298546-0007,compound for sins we're most inclined to by damning those we have no mind to in any case montgomery felt that of all the men concerned in such a fight promoters backers spectators it is the actual fighter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10648,8838-298546-0008,who holds the strongest and most honourable position his conscience gave him no concern upon the subject endurance and courage are virtues not vices and brutality is at least better than effeminacy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10649,8838-298546-0009,the assistant strolled down there after tea and asked in a casual way whether the tobacconist had ever heard of the master of croxley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10650,8838-298546-0010,the little man could hardly articulate in his astonishment why sir he's the first mon o the district an his name's as well known in the west riding as the winner o t derby but lor sir here he stopped and rummaged among a heap of papers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10651,8838-298546-0011,and so the croxley herald has his life an record an here it is an thou canst read it for thysel the sheet of the paper which he held up was a lake of print around an islet of illustration the latter was a coarse wood cut of a pugilist's head and neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10652,8838-298546-0012,silas craggs and beneath the master of croxley thou'll find all about him there sir said the tobacconist he's a witherin tyke he is and we're proud to have him in the county if he hadn't broke his leg he'd have been champion of england,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10653,8838-298546-0013,broke his leg has he yes and it set badly they ca him owd k behind his back for that is how his two legs look but his arms well if they was both stropped to a bench as the sayin is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10654,8838-298546-0014,i'll take this with me said montgomery and putting the paper into his pocket he returned home it was not a cheering record which he read there the whole history of the croxley master was given in full his many victories his few defeats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10655,8838-298546-0015,born in eighteen fifty seven said the provincial biographer silas craggs better known in sporting circles as the master of croxley is now in his fortieth year hang it i'm only twenty three,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10656,8838-298546-0016,and won the proud title which he still holds ambitious of a more than local fame he secured a patron and fought his first fight against jack barton of birmingham in may eighteen eighty at the old loiterers club craggs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10657,8838-298546-0017,who fought at ten stone two at the time had the better of fifteen rattling rounds and gained an award on points against the midlander having disposed of james dunn of rotherhithe cameron of glasgow and a youth named fernie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10658,8838-298546-0018,it was owing to this that he was defeated in seven rounds by willox the man whom he had previously beaten and afterwards by james shaw of london though the latter acknowledged that he had found the toughest customer of his career undismayed by his reverses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10659,8838-298546-0019,the master adapted the style of his fighting to his physical disabilities and resumed his career of victory defeating norton the black hobby wilson and levi cohen the latter a heavy weight conceding two stone he fought a draw with the famous billy mc quire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10660,8838-298546-0020,who may wish to learn the difference between a bar room scramble and a scientific contest the latest of these ambitious souls comes from the wilson coal pits which have undertaken to put up a stake of one hundred pounds and back their local champion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10661,8838-298546-0021,there are various rumours afloat as to who their representative is to be the name of ted barton being freely mentioned but the betting which is seven to one on the master against any untried man is a fair reflection of the feeling of the community,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10722,5514-19192-0028,as repression has the army it does not count its men and as it has vincennes it does not count its shots repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge boxes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10752,5514-19193-0007,and assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement he added my name is eight pounder in fact a new personage had entered on the scene this was a second piece of ordnance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10753,5514-19193-0008,and placed this second piece in line with the first this outlined the catastrophe a few minutes later the two pieces rapidly served were firing point blank at the redoubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10754,5514-19193-0009,the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery another cannonade was audible at some distance at the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the rue de la chanvrerie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10756,5514-19193-0011,the other balls the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents mingled with bursts of grape shot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10757,5514-19193-0012,the object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from the summit of the redoubt and to compel them to gather close in the interior that is to say this announced the assault the combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10758,5514-19193-0013,from the windows of the cabaret by grape shot the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off perhaps even without being seen could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10759,5514-19193-0014,and he shouted fire on the artillery men all were ready the barricade which had long been silent poured forth a desperate fire seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of rage and joy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10760,5514-19193-0015,the street was filled with blinding smoke and at the end of a few minutes athwart this mist all streaked with flame two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10762,5514-19193-0017,another quarter of an hour of this success and there will not be any cartridges left in the barricade it appears that gavroche overheard this remark chapter fifteen gavroche outside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10763,5514-19193-0018,courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine shop had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10764,5514-19193-0019,the full cartridge boxes of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the slope of the redoubt into his basket what are you doing there asked courfeyrac gavroche raised his face i'm filling my basket citizen don't you see the grape shot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10765,5514-19193-0020,gavroche replied well it is raining what then courfeyrac shouted come in instanter said gavroche and with a single bound he plunged into the street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10766,5514-19193-0021,it will be remembered that fannicot's company had left behind it a trail of bodies twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street twenty cartouches for gavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10767,5514-19193-0022,the smoke in the street was like a fog whoever has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10768,5514-19193-0023,it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10769,5514-19193-0024,this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful to gavroche beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10770,5514-19193-0025,he rifled the first seven or eight cartridge boxes without much danger he crawled flat on his belly galloped on all fours took his basket in his teeth twisted glided undulated wound from one dead body to another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10771,5514-19193-0026,and emptied the cartridge box or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him on one body that of a corporal he found a powder flask,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10772,5514-19193-0027,for thirst said he putting it in his pocket by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade became transparent so that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the outlook behind their paving stone dike,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10773,5514-19193-0028,and the sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke at the moment when gavroche was relieving a sergeant who was lying near a stone door post of his cartridges a bullet struck the body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10774,5514-19193-0029,fichtre ejaculated gavroche they are killing my dead men for me a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him a third overturned his basket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10775,5514-19193-0030,it was a charming and terrible sight gavroche though shot at was teasing the fusillade he had the air of being greatly diverted it was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen to each discharge he retorted with a couplet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10776,5514-19193-0031,they aimed at him constantly and always missed him the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him he lay down sprang to his feet hid in the corner of a doorway then made a bound disappeared re appeared scampered away returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10777,5514-19193-0032,replied to the grape shot with his thumb at his nose and all the while went on pillaging the cartouches emptying the cartridge boxes and filling his basket the insurgents panting with anxiety followed him with their eyes the barricade trembled he sang,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10778,5514-19193-0033,he was not a child he was not a man he was a strange gamin fairy he might have been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray the bullets flew after him he was more nimble than they he played a fearful game of hide and seek with death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10779,5514-19193-0034,every time that the flat nosed face of the spectre approached the urchin administered to it a fillip one bullet however better aimed or more treacherous than the rest finally struck the will o' the wisp of a child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10780,5514-19193-0035,gavroche was seen to stagger then he sank to the earth the whole barricade gave vent to a cry but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth gavroche had fallen only to rise again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10781,8095-274346-0000,charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances he was however in his heart extremely averse to these furious measures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10782,8095-274346-0001,though a determined protestant by principle as well as inclination he had entertained no violent horror against popery and a little humanity he thought was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10783,8095-274346-0002,an abatement of the more rigorous laws was all he intended and his engagements with france notwithstanding that their regular execution had never been promised or expected required of him some indulgence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10784,8095-274346-0003,but so unfortunate was this prince that no measure embraced during his whole reign was ever attended with more unhappy and more fatal consequences,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10785,8095-274346-0004,the extreme rage against popery was a sure characteristic of puritanism the house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10786,8095-274346-0005,they petitioned the king for replacing such able clergy as had been silenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies they also enacted laws for the strict observance of sunday which the puritans affected to call the sabbath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10787,8095-274346-0006,and which they sanctified by the most melancholy indolence it is to be remarked that the different appellations of this festival were at that time known symbols of the different parties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10788,8095-274346-0007,the king finding that the parliament was resolved to grant him no supply and would furnish him with nothing but empty protestations of duty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10789,8095-274346-0008,was intrusted with the command he sailed immediately for cadiz and found the bay full of spanish ships of great value he either neglected to attack these ships or attempted it preposterously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10790,8095-274346-0009,the army was landed and a fort taken but the undisciplined soldiers finding store of wine could not be restrained from the utmost excesses further stay appearing fruitless they were reembarked and the fleet put to sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10791,8095-274346-0010,with an intention of intercepting the spanish galleons but the plague having seized the seamen and soldiers they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this prize and return to england loud complaints were made against the court for intrusting so important a command,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10792,8095-274346-0011,was obliged again to have recourse to a parliament though the ill success of his enterprises diminished his authority and showed every day more plainly the imprudence of the spanish war though the increase of his necessities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10793,8095-274346-0012,rendered him more dependent and more exposed to the encroachments of the commons he was resolved to try once more that regular and constitutional expedient for supply perhaps too a little political art which at that time he practised,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10794,8095-274346-0013,was much trusted to he had named four popular leaders sheriffs of counties sir edward coke sir robert philips sir thomas wentworth and sir francis seymour and though the question had been formerly much contested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10795,8095-274346-0014,he thought that he had by that means incapacitated them from being elected members but his intention being so evident rather put the commons more upon their guard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10796,8095-274346-0015,enow of patriots still remained to keep up the ill humor of the house and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recommend to them practices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10797,8095-274346-0016,the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the occasion and ill fitted to promote those views of success and glory for which the young prince in his first enterprise so ardently longed but this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10798,8095-274346-0017,the supply was only voted by the commons the passing of that vote into a law was reserved till the end of the session a condition was thereby made in a very undisguised manner with their sovereign,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10799,8095-274346-0018,under color of redressing grievances which during this short reign could not be very numerous they were to proceed in regulating and controlling every part of government which displeased them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10800,8095-274346-0019,and if the king either cut them short in this undertaking or refused compliance with their demands he must not expect any supply from the commons great dissatisfaction was expressed by charles at a treatment which he deemed so harsh and undutiful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10801,8095-274346-0020,but his urgent necessities obliged him to submit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10802,8095-274346-0021,had expressed all duty and obedience in expectation that an opportunity would offer of reinstating himself in his former credit and authority even after charles's accession he despaired not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10803,8095-274346-0022,he submitted to the king's commands of remaining at his country seat and of absenting himself from parliament many trials he made to regain the good opinion of his master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10804,8095-274346-0023,but finding them all fruitless and observing charles to be entirely governed by buckingham his implacable enemy he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court a new spirit he saw and a new power arising in the nation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10805,8095-274346-0024,and to these he was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection when the parliament was summoned charles by a stretch of prerogative had given orders that no writ as is customary should be sent to bristol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10806,8095-274346-0025,that nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition and craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due as a peer of the realm his writ was sent him but accompanied with a letter from the lord keeper coventry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10807,8095-274346-0026,commanding him in the king's name to absent himself from parliament this letter bristol conveyed to the lords and asked advice how to proceed in so delicate a situation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10808,8095-274346-0027,the king's prohibition was withdrawn and bristol took his seat provoked at these repeated instances of vigor which the court denominated contumacy charles ordered his attorney general to enter an accusation of high treason against him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10809,8095-274346-0028,by way of recrimination bristol accused buckingham of high treason both the earl's defence of himself and accusation of the duke remain and together with some original letters still extant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10810,8095-274346-0029,of delivering ships to the french king in order to serve against the hugonots of being employed in the sale of honors and offices of accepting extensive grants from the crown of procuring many titles of honor for his kindred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10811,8095-274346-0030,and of administering physic to the late king without acquainting his physicians all these articles appear from comparing the accusation and reply to be either frivolous or false or both,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10812,8095-274346-0031,the only charge which could be regarded as important was that he had extorted a sum of ten thousand pounds from the east india company and that he had confiscated some goods belonging to french merchants on pretence of their being the property of spanish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10813,8095-274346-0032,so that it is difficult for us to give a decisive opinion with regard to these articles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10814,8095-274346-0033,but so rivetted throughout the nation were the prejudices with regard to spanish deceit and falsehood that very few of the commons seem as yet to have been convinced that they had been seduced by buckingham's narrative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10815,8095-274346-0034,a certain proof that a discovery of this nature was not as is imagined by several historians,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10816,8095-274346-0035,the king seemed desirous of embracing every opportunity by which he could express a contempt and disregard for them no one was at that time sufficiently sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in the balance of the constitution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10817,8095-274346-0036,the history of england had never hitherto afforded one instance where any great movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower house and as their rank both considered in a body and as individuals was but the second in the kingdom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10818,8095-274346-0037,nothing less than fatal experience could engage the english princes to pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable assembly the earl of suffolk chancellor of the university of cambridge dying about this time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10819,8095-274346-0038,buckingham though lying under impeachment was yet by means of court interest chosen in his place the commons resented and loudly complained of this affront and the more to enrage them the king himself wrote a letter to the university extolling the duke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10820,8095-274346-0039,yet lest any ambiguity should remain sir dudley carleton vice chamberlain took care to explain it i pray you consider said he what these new counsels are or may be i fear to declare those that i conceive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10821,8095-274346-0040,in all christian kingdoms you know that parliaments were in use anciently by which those kingdoms were governed in a most flourishing manner until the monarchs began to know their own strength and seeing the turbulent spirit of their parliaments at length,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10822,8095-274346-0041,they by little and little began to stand on their prerogatives and at last overthrew the parliaments throughout christendom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10823,8095-274346-0042,which bringeth such happiness to this nation and makes us envied of all others while there is this sweetness between his majesty and the commons lest we lose the repute of a free people by our turbulency in parliament,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10824,8095-274346-0043,these imprudent suggestions rather gave warning than struck terror a precarious liberty the commons thought which was to be preserved by unlimited complaisance was no liberty at all and it was necessary while yet in their power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10825,8095-274346-0044,to secure the constitution by such invincible barriers that no king or minister should ever for the future dare to speak such a language to any parliament or even entertain such a project against them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10826,8095-274346-0045,the commons immediately declared that they would proceed no further upon business till they had satisfaction in their privileges charles alleged as the reason of this measure certain seditious expressions which he said had in their accusation of the duke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10827,8095-274346-0046,dropped from these members upon inquiry it appeared that no such expressions had been used the members were released and the king reaped no other benefit from this attempt than to exasperate the house still,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10828,8095-274346-0047,and to show some degree of precipitancy and indiscretion moved by this example the house of peers were roused from their inactivity and claimed liberty for the earl of arundel who had been lately confined in the tower,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10829,8095-274346-0048,after many fruitless evasions the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10830,8095-274346-0049,his mother who had great influence over him was a professed catholic his wife was not free from suspicion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10831,8095-274346-0050,so violent was the bigotry of the times that it was thought a sufficient reason for disqualifying any one from holding an office,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10832,8095-274346-0051,this article together with the new impositions laid on merchandise by james constituted near half of the crown revenues and by depriving the king of these resources they would have reduced him to total subjection and dependence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10833,8095-274346-0052,while they retained such a pledge besides the supply already promised they were sure that nothing could be refused them though after canvassing the matter near three ninths they found themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10834,8095-274346-0053,the smallest appearance of guilt could not be fixed upon him what idea he asked must all mankind entertain of his honor should he sacrifice his innocent friend to pecuniary considerations what further authority should he retain in the nation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10835,8095-274346-0054,were he capable in the beginning of his reign to give in so signal an instance such matter of triumph to his enemies and discouragement to his adherents to day the commons pretend to wrest his minister from him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10836,8095-274346-0055,to morrow they will attack some branch of his prerogative by their remonstrances and promises and protestations they had engaged the crown in a war as soon as they saw a retreat impossible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10837,8095-274346-0056,without waiting for new incidents without covering themselves with new pretences they immediately deserted him and refused him all reasonable supply it was evident that they desired nothing so much as to see him plunged in inextricable difficulties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10838,8095-274346-0057,of which they intended to take advantage to such deep perfidy to such unbounded usurpations it was necessary to oppose a proper firmness and resolution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10839,8095-274348-0000,and who from a private station had mounted in the earliest youth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10840,8095-274348-0001,he dared to carry his ambitious addresses to the queen herself and he failed not to make impression on a heart not undisposed to the tender passions that attachment at least of the mind which appears so delicious and is so dangerous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10841,8095-274348-0002,seems to have been encouraged by the princess and the duke presumed so far on her good graces that after his departure he secretly returned upon some pretence and paying a visit to the queen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10842,8095-274348-0003,was dismissed with a reproof which savored more of kindness than of anger information of this correspondence was soon carried to richelieu the vigilance of that minister was here further roused by jealousy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10843,8095-274348-0004,he too either from vanity or politics had ventured to pay his addresses to the queen but a priest past middle age of a severe character and occupied in the most extensive plans of ambition or vengeance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10844,8095-274348-0005,entirely disposed to gayety and gallantry the cardinal's disappointment strongly inclined him to counterwork the amorous projects of his rival when the duke was making preparations for a new embassy to paris,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10845,8095-274348-0006,a message was sent him from louis that he must not think of such a journey in a romantic passion he swore that he would see the queen in spite of all the power of france,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10846,8095-274348-0007,and from that moment he determined to engage england in a war with that kingdom he first took advantage of some quarrels excited by the queen of england's attendants and he persuaded charles to dismiss at once all her french servants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10847,8095-274348-0008,contrary to the articles of the marriage treaty he encouraged the english ships of war and privateers to seize vessels belonging to french merchants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10848,8095-274348-0009,and strongly solicited charles to embrace the protection of these distressed religionists he represented that after the inhabitants of rochelle had been repressed by the combined squadrons of england and holland,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10849,8095-274348-0010,after peace was concluded with the french king under charles's mediation the ambitious cardinal was still meditating the destruction of the hugonots that preparations were silently making in every province of france for the suppression of their religion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10850,8095-274348-0011,that forts were erected in order to bridle rochelle the most considerable bulwark of the protestants that the reformed in france cast their eyes on charles as the head of their faith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10851,8095-274348-0012,and considered him as a prince engaged by interest as well as inclination to support them that so long as their party subsisted charles might rely on their attachment as much as on that of his own subjects but if their liberties were once ravished from them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10852,8095-274348-0013,the power of france freed from this impediment would soon become formidable to england and to all the neighboring nations though charles probably bore but small favor to the hugonots who so much resembled the puritans in discipline and worship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10853,8095-274348-0014,in religion and politics he yet allowed himself to be gained by these arguments enforced by the solicitations of buckingham a fleet of a hundred sail and an army of seven thousand men were fitted out for the invasion of france,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10854,8095-274348-0015,and both of them intrusted to the command of the duke who was altogether unacquainted both with land and sea service the fleet appeared before rochelle but so ill concerted were buckingham's measures that the inhabitants of that city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10855,8095-274348-0016,shut their gates and refused to admit allies of whose coming they were not previously informed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10856,8095-274348-0017,hastened the vengeance of their master exhausted their provisions in supplying their allies and were threatened with an immediate siege,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10857,8095-274345-0000,no sooner had charles taken into his hands the reins of government than he showed an impatience to assemble the great council of the nation and he would gladly for the sake of despatch have called together the same parliament which had sitten under his father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10858,8095-274345-0001,and which lay at that time under prorogation but being told that this measure would appear unusual he issued writs for summoning a new parliament on the seventh of may and it was not without regret that the arrival of the princess henrietta,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10859,8095-274345-0002,unexperienced and impolitic regarded as sincere all the praises and caresses with which he had been loaded while active in procuring the rupture with the house of austria and besides that he labored under great necessities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10860,8095-274345-0003,he lightly mentioned the occasion which he had for supply he employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of the members he would not even allow the officers of the crown who had seats in the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10861,8095-274345-0004,and that great anticipations were likewise made on the revenues of the crown they were not ignorant that charles was loaded with a large debt contracted by his father who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from foreign princes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10862,8095-274345-0005,they had learned by experience that the public revenue could with difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown even under the ordinary charges of government,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10863,8095-274345-0006,they were sensible that the present war was very lately the result of their own importunate applications and entreaties and that they had solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the management of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10864,8095-274345-0007,they were acquainted with the difficulty of military enterprises directed against the whole house of austria against the king of spain possessed of the greatest riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in europe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10865,8095-274345-0008,against the emperor ferdinand hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age who had subdued and astonished germany by the rapidity of his victories deep impressions they saw must be made by the english sword,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10866,8095-274345-0009,and a vigorous offensive war be waged against these mighty potentates ere they would resign a principality which they had now fully subdued and which they held in secure possession by its being surrounded with all their other territories,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10867,8095-274345-0010,to answer therefore all these great and important ends to satisfy their young king in the first request which he made them to prove their sense of the many royal virtues particularly economy with which charles was endued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10868,8095-274345-0011,the house of commons conducted by the wisest and ablest senators that had ever flourished in england thought proper to confer on the king a supply of two subsidies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10869,8095-274345-0012,which the present conjuncture could suggest to them it is not to be doubted but spleen and ill will against the duke of buckingham had an influence with many so vast and rapid a fortune so little merited,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10870,8095-274345-0013,could not fail to excite public envy and however men's hatred might have been suspended for a moment while the duke's conduct seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices it was impossible for him long to preserve the affections of the people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10871,8095-274345-0014,his influence over the modesty of charles exceeded even that which he had acquired over the weakness of james nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel and direction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10872,8095-274345-0015,his vehement temper prompted him to raise suddenly to the highest elevation his flatterers and dependants and upon the least occasion of displeasure he threw them down with equal impetuosity and violence implacable in his hatred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10873,8095-274345-0016,fickle in his friendships all men were either regarded as his enemies or dreaded soon to become such the whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his insatiable hand while he both engrossed the entire confidence of his master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10874,8095-274345-0017,and held invested in his single person the most considerable offices of the crown however the ill humor of the commons might have been increased by these considerations we are not to suppose them the sole motives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10875,8095-274345-0018,the last parliament of james amidst all their joy and festivity had given him a supply very disproportioned to his demand and to the occasion and as every house of commons which was elected during forty years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10876,8095-274345-0019,succeeded to all the passions and principles of their predecessors we ought rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the kingdom during that whole period than from any circumstances which attended this particular conjuncture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10877,8095-274345-0020,the nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of taxes and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting their sovereign even elizabeth notwithstanding her vigor and frugality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10878,8095-274345-0021,and the necessary wars in which she was engaged had reason to complain of the commons in this particular nor could the authority of that princess which was otherwise almost absolute ever extort from them the requisite supplies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10879,8095-274345-0022,would not augment their number in the same proportion the puritanical party though disguised had a great authority over the kingdom and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that sect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10880,8095-274345-0023,all these were disgusted with the court both by the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty essential to their party and on account of the restraint under which they were held by the established hierarchy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10881,8095-274345-0024,in order to fortify himself against the resentment of james buckingham had affected popularity and entered into the cabals of the puritans but being secure of the confidence of charles he had since abandoned this party,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10882,8095-274345-0025,and on that account was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment though the religious schemes of many of the puritans when explained appear pretty frivolous we are not thence to imagine that they were pursued by none but persons of weak understandings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10883,8095-274345-0026,the match with france and the articles in favor of catholics which were suspected to be in the treaty were likewise causes of disgust to this whole party,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10884,8095-274345-0027,though it must be remarked that the connections with that crown were much less obnoxious to the protestants and less agreeable to the catholics than the alliance formerly projected with spain and were therefore received rather with pleasure than dissatisfaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10885,8095-274345-0028,as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in prosecution of them among these we may mention the names of sir edward coke sir edwin sandys sir robert philips sir francis seymour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10887,8095-274345-0030,of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass though their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and precedents favorable to kingly power and had been able notwithstanding to preserve some small remains of liberty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10888,8095-274345-0031,it would be impossible they thought when all these pretensions were methodised and prosecuted by the increasing knowledge of the age to maintain any shadow of popular government in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10889,8095-274345-0032,it was necessary to fix a choice either to abandon entirely the privileges of the people or to secure them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitution had hitherto provided for them in this dilemma,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10890,8095-274345-0033,men of such aspiring geniuses and such independent fortunes could not long deliberate they boldly embraced the side of freedom and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prince without extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10891,8095-274345-0034,the end they esteemed beneficent and noble the means regular and constitutional to grant or refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons and as all human governments particularly those of a mixed frame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10893,6081-42010-0000,he first of all proceeded to the prefecture of police going the longest way round as a matter of course but on reaching his destination he could find no one who had seen the young detective accordingly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10896,6081-42010-0003,he was returning in haste a trifle uneasy on account of the length of his absence when he perceived a cab pull up in front of the palais gateway a second glance and oh great good fortune he saw lecoq,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

10900,6081-42010-0007,was he not bringing with him the most potent of justifications he thought of the agreeable surprise he had in store for the magistrate and fancied he could picture the sudden brightening of that functionary's gloomy face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10901,6081-42010-0008,and yet fate so willed it that the doorkeeper's message and his urgent appeal that lecoq should not loiter on the way produced the most unfortunate results,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10902,6081-42010-0009,when he saw however that the magistrate was not alone and when he recognized polyte chupin the original of the photograph,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10903,6081-42010-0010,he instantly perceived his mistake and understood its consequences there was only one thing to be done he must prevent any exchange of words between the two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10904,6081-42010-0011,he ordered her to leave the room at once but the poor creature was quite overcome and trembled like a leaf her eyes were fixed upon her unworthy husband and the happiness she felt at seeing him again shone plainly in her anxious gaze,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10905,6081-42010-0012,just for one second and then she caught his withering glance and heard his words of menace terror stricken she staggered back and then lecoq seized her around the waist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10906,6081-42010-0013,and lifting her with his strong arms carried her out into the passage the whole scene had been so brief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10907,6081-42010-0014,was still forming the order for toinon to be removed from the room when he found the door closed again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10908,6081-42010-0015,ah ah thought the smiling clerk in a flutter of delight this is something new but as these little diversions never made him forget his duties he leaned toward the magistrate and asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10909,6081-42010-0016,and word for word if you please he paused the door opened again this time to admit the magistrate's messenger who timidly and with a rather guilty air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10910,6081-42010-0017,at the same time casting the blame on his own impatience and lack of caution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10911,6081-42010-0018,yet obtaining the information he desired let us proceed he said to polyte who had not moved since his wife had been taken from the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10912,6081-42010-0019,being to all appearances sublimely indifferent to everything passing around him to the magistrate's proposal he carelessly nodded assent was that your wife who came in just now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10913,6081-42010-0020,why did you behave in that manner it wasn't the time for sentiment you are not telling the truth you simply desired to attract her attention to influence her evidence i,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10914,6081-42010-0021,i influence her evidence i don't understand you but for that supposition your words would have been meaningless what words the magistrate turned to his clerk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10915,6081-42010-0022,read the last remark you took down in a monotonous voice the smiling clerk repeated i should like to kill the person who dared to say that i knew lacheneur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10916,6081-42010-0023,what did you mean by that it's very easy to understand sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10917,6081-42010-0024,don't prevaricate any longer he said you certainly ordered your wife not to say anything about lacheneur that's evident why did you do so what are you afraid of her telling us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10918,6081-42010-0025,do you suppose the police are ignorant of your acquaintance with lacheneur of your conversation with him when he came in a cab to the corner of the waste ground near your mother's wine shop and of the hopes of fortune you based upon his promises,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10919,6081-42010-0026,be guided by me confess everything while there is yet time and abandon the present course which may lead you into serious danger one may be an accomplice in more ways than one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10920,6081-42010-0027,as these words fell on polyte's ears it was evident his impudence and indifference had received a severe shock he seemed confounded and hung his head as if thoroughly abashed still he preserved an obstinate silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10921,6081-42010-0028,and the magistrate finding that this last thrust had failed to produce any effect gave up the fight in despair he rang the bell and ordered the guard to conduct the witness back to prison,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10922,6081-42010-0029,and to take every precaution to prevent him seeing his wife again when polyte had departed lecoq reentered the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10923,6081-42010-0030,but i thought you would be waiting for me and made haste to bring her here i thought i was acting for the best never mind the misfortune can be repaired no sir no since she has seen her husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10924,6081-42010-0031,it is quite impossible to get her to speak she loves that rascal intensely and he has a wonderful influence over her you heard what he said he threatened her with death if she breathed a word about lacheneur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10925,6081-42010-0032,and she is so terrified that there is no hope of making her speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10926,6081-42010-0033,again set foot in his office the poor creature seemed nearly heartbroken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10927,6081-42010-0034,polyte's threat had aroused the most sinister apprehensions in her mind not understanding his connection with the affair she asked herself if her testimony might not prove his death warrant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10928,6081-42010-0035,no or i don't know and retracted everything she had previously stated to lecoq she swore that she had been misunderstood that her words had been misconstrued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10929,6081-42010-0036,at last she burst into wild despairing sobs and pressed her frightened child against her breast what could be done to overcome this foolish obstinacy as blind and unreasoning as a brute's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10930,6081-42010-0037,but remember that your strange silence injures your husband far more than anything you could say she left the room or rather she rushed wildly from it as though only too eager to escape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10931,6081-41997-0000,hence the driver's hope of finding them in the rue de bourgogne,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10932,6081-41997-0001,and yet he did not hesitate to jump on to the box and give the signal for starting in so doing he obeyed a maxim which he had,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10933,6081-41997-0002,a maxim intended to assure his after fame and which ran as follows always suspect that which seems probable and begin by believing what appears incredible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10934,6081-41997-0003,as soon as the vehicle was well under way the young detective proceeded to ingratiate himself into the driver's good graces being anxious to obtain all the information that this worthy was able to impart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10935,6081-41997-0004,in a tone that implied that all trifling would be useless the cabman cried hey up hey up cocotte and his mare pricked up her ears and quickened her pace so that the rue de choisy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10936,6081-41997-0005,was speedily reached then it was that lecoq resumed his inquiries well my good fellow he began you have told me the principal facts now i should like the details,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10937,6081-41997-0006,how did these two women attract your attention,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10938,6081-41997-0007,i had been having a most unfortunate day six hours on a stand on the boulevards with the rain pouring all the time it was simply awful at midnight i had not made more than a franc and a,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10939,6081-41997-0008,half for myself but i was so wet and miserable and the horse seemed so done up that i decided to go home i did grumble i can tell you well i had just passed the corner of the rue picard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10940,6081-41997-0009,when i saw two women standing under a lamp some little distance off i did not pay any attention to them for when a man is as old as i am women go on said lecoq who could not restrain his impatience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10941,6081-41997-0010,i had already passed them when they began to call after me i pretended i did not hear them but one of them ran after the cab crying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10942,6081-41997-0011,a louis for yourself i hesitated for a moment when the woman added and ten francs for the fare i then drew up lecoq was boiling over with impatience but he felt that the wisest course was not to interrupt the driver with questions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10943,6081-41997-0012,but to listen to all he had to say as you may suppose continued the coachman i wasn't inclined to trust two such suspicious characters alone at that hour and in that part of the city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10944,6081-41997-0013,so just as they were about to get into the cab i called to them wait a bit my little friends you have promised papa some sous where are they the one who had called after the cab at once handed me thirty francs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10945,6081-41997-0014,saying above all make haste your recital could not be more minute exclaimed lecoq approvingly now how about these two women,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10946,6081-41997-0015,which ran after you the girl who was neatly dressed the one who the driver suddenly paused some vivid remembrance passed through his brain and abruptly jerking the rains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10947,6081-41997-0016,i did notice something strange one of the two women called the other madame as large as life while the other said thee and thou and spoke as if she were somebody,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10948,6081-41997-0017,and which was it that said thee and thou,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10949,6081-41997-0018,she with shabby dress and shoes as big as a gouty man's you should have seen her shake the prim looking girl as if she had been a plum tree you little fool said she do you want to ruin us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10950,6081-41997-0019,you will have time to faint when we get home now come along and then she began to sob indeed madame indeed i can't she said and really she seemed quite unable to move in fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10951,6081-41997-0020,she appeared to be so ill that i said to myself here is a young woman who has drunk more than is good for her these facts confirmed even if they corrected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10952,6081-41997-0021,lecoq's first suppositions as he had suspected the social position of the two women was not the same he had been mistaken however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10953,6081-41997-0022,in attributing the higher standing to the woman wearing the shoes with the high heels the marks of which he had so particularly noticed in the snow with all the attendant signs of precipitation terror and weakness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10954,6081-41997-0023,in reality social preeminence belonged to the woman who had left the large broad footprints behind her and not merely was she of a superior rank but she had also shown superior energy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10955,6081-41997-0024,contrary to lecoq's original idea it now seemed evident that she was the mistress and her companion the servant is that all my good fellow he asked the driver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10956,6081-41997-0025,had a hand as small as a child's and in spite of her anger her voice was as sweet as music did you see her face i just caught a glimpse of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10957,6081-41997-0026,whether she was a blonde or brunette so many questions at a time confused the driver stop a minute he replied in my opinion she wasn't pretty and i don't believe she was young,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10958,6081-41997-0027,but she certainly was a blonde and with plenty of hair too was she tall or short stout or slender between the two this was very vague and the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10959,6081-41997-0028,asked lecoq the neatly dressed one the deuce as for her i did not notice her at all all i know about her is that she was very small would you recognize her if you met her again good heavens no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10960,6081-41997-0029,the vehicle was now rolling along the rue de bourgogne half way down the street the driver pulled up and turning to lecoq exclaimed here we are that's the house the hussies went into,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10961,6081-41997-0030,to draw off the silk handkerchief that served him as a muffler to fold it and slip it into his pocket to spring to the ground and enter the house indicated was only the work of an instant for the young detective,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10962,6081-41997-0031,in the concierge's little room he found an old woman knitting lecoq bowed to her politely and displaying the silk handkerchief exclaimed madame i have come to return this article to one of your lodgers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10963,6081-41997-0032,to which one really i don't exactly know in a moment the worthy dame imagined that this polite young man was making fun of her you scamp she began,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10964,6081-41997-0033,excuse me interrupted lecoq allow me to finish i must tell you that at about three o'clock in the morning of the day before yesterday i was quietly returning home when two ladies who were seemingly in a great hurry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10965,6081-41997-0034,overtook me and passed on one of them dropped this handkerchief which i picked up i hastened after her to restore it but before i could overtake them they had rung the bell at your door and were already in the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10966,6081-41997-0035,for fear of disturbing you yesterday i was so busy i couldn't come however here i am at last and here's the handkerchief so saying,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10967,6081-41997-0036,i slipped on my dress and went out into the hall where i saw two women hastening toward the door before i could reach them they slammed the door in my face i opened it again as quickly as i could and looked out into the street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10968,6081-41997-0037,but they were hurrying away as fast as they could in what direction oh they were running toward the rue de varennes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10969,6081-41997-0038,however he bowed civilly to the concierge whom he might possibly have need of at another time and then went back to the cab as i had supposed they do not live here he remarked to the driver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10970,6081-41998-0000,when a mysterious crime has been perpetrated or a great catastrophe has happened and the identity of the victims has not been established a great day invariably follows at the morgue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10971,6081-41998-0001,the attendants are so accustomed to the horrors of the place that the most sickly sight fails to impress them and even under the most distressing circumstances they hasten gaily to and fro,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10972,6081-41998-0002,exchanging jests well calculated to make an ordinary mortal's flesh creep as a rule they are far less interested in the corpses laid out for public view on the marble slabs in the principal hall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10973,6081-41998-0003,as the vehicle conveying lecoq reached the quay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10974,6081-41998-0004,the newspapers had reported the tragedy at the widow chupin's drinking den of course more or less correctly and everybody wished to see the victims,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10975,6081-41998-0005,i prefer to alight here rather than in front of the morgue he said springing to the ground then producing first his watch and next his purse he added,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10976,6081-41998-0006,we have been an hour and forty minutes my good fellow consequently i owe you nothing at all replied the driver decidedly but no not a sou,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10977,6081-41998-0007,i am too worried already to think that i took the money these hussies offered me it would only have served me right if the liquor i bought with it had given me the gripes don't be uneasy about the score and if you need a trap use mine for nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10978,6081-41998-0008,till you have caught the jades as lecoq's purse was low he did not insist you will at least take my name and address continued the driver certainly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10979,6081-41998-0009,the magistrate will want your evidence and a summons will be sent you all right then address it to papillon eugene driver,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10980,6081-41998-0010,i lodge at his place because i have some small interest in the business you see the young detective was hastening away when papillon called him back when you leave the morgue you will want to go somewhere else he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10981,6081-41998-0011,you told me that you had another appointment and that you were already late yes i ought to be at the palais de justice but it is only a few steps from here no matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10982,6081-41998-0012,i will wait for you at the corner of the bridge it's useless to say no i've made up my mind and i'm a breton you know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10983,6081-41998-0013,accordingly lecoq made a gesture of assent and then hurried toward the morgue if there was a crowd on the roadway outside it was because the gloomy building itself was crammed full of people indeed the sightseers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10984,6081-41998-0014,most of whom could see nothing at all were packed as closely as sardines,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10985,6081-41998-0015,that lecoq managed to effect an entrance as usual he found among the mob a large number of girls and women for strange to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10986,6081-41998-0016,to the disgusting sights and horrible emotions that repay a visit to the morgue the shop and work girls who reside in the neighborhood readily go out of their way to catch a glimpse of the corpses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10987,6081-41998-0017,which crime accident and suicide bring to this horrible place a few,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10988,6081-41998-0018,may come no further than the door but the others enter and after a long stare return and recount their impressions to their less courageous companions if there should be no corpse exhibited,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10989,6081-41998-0019,if all the marble slabs are unoccupied strange as it may seem the visitors turn hastily away with an expression of disappointment or discontent there was no fear of their doing so however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10990,6081-41998-0020,for the mysterious murderer whose identity lecoq was trying to establish had furnished three victims for their delectation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10991,6081-41998-0021,and yet a damp chill came from beyond the iron railings while from the crowd itself rose an infectious vapor impregnated with the stench of the chloride of lime used as a disinfectant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10992,6081-41998-0022,as a continuous accompaniment to the exclamations sighs and whispered comments of the bystanders came the murmur of the water trickling from a spigot at the head of each slab a tiny stream that flowed forth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10993,6081-41998-0023,only to fall in fine spray upon the marble through the small arched windows a gray light stole in on the exposed bodies bringing each muscle into bold relief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10994,6081-41998-0024,revealing the ghastly tints of the lifeless flesh and imparting a sinister aspect to the tattered clothing hung around the room to aid in the identification of the corpses this clothing after a certain time is sold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10995,6081-41998-0025,for nothing is wasted at the morgue however lecoq was too occupied with his own thoughts to remark the horrors of the scene he scarcely bestowed a glance on the three victims,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10996,6081-41998-0026,whom he could not perceive had gevrol intentionally or unintentionally failed to fulfil his promise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10997,6081-41998-0027,unable to explain the cause of his comrade's absence lecoq addressed himself to the head keeper it would seem that no one has recognized the victims he remarked no one and yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10998,6081-41998-0028,ever since opening we have had an immense crowd if i were master here on days like this i would charge an admission fee of two sous a head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
10999,6081-41998-0029,it would bring in a round sum more than enough to cover the expenses the keeper's reply seemed to offer an inducement to conversation but lecoq did not seize it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11000,6081-41998-0030,but after a moment's hesitation he ventured to inquire are you one of them yes i am replied lecoq exhibiting his card in support of his assertion and your name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11001,6081-41998-0031,the keeper's face brightened up in that case said he i have a letter for you written by your comrade who was obliged to go away here it is the young detective at once tore open the envelope and read,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11002,6081-41998-0032,monsieur lecoq monsieur this simple formula of politeness brought a faint smile to his lips,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11003,6081-41998-0033,when at about nine o'clock three young men entered arm in arm from their manner and appearance i judged them to be clerks in some store or warehouse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11004,6081-41998-0034,suddenly i noticed that one of them turned as white as his shirt and calling the attention of his companions to one of the unknown victims he whispered gustave,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11005,6081-41998-0035,his comrades put their hands over his mouth and one of them exclaimed what are you about you fool to mix yourself up with this affair do you want to get us into trouble thereupon they went out and i followed them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11006,6081-41998-0036,but the person who had first spoken was so overcome that he could scarcely drag himself along and his companions were obliged to take him to a little restaurant close by i entered it myself and it is there i write this letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11007,6081-41998-0037,in the mean time watching them out of the corner of my eye i send this note explaining my absence to the head keeper who will give it you you will understand that i am going to follow these men a b,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11008,6081-41998-0038,s the handwriting of this letter was almost illegible and there were mistakes in spelling in well nigh every line still its meaning was clear and exact and could not fail to excite the most flattering hopes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11009,6081-41998-0039,as the old coachman urged on his horse he could not refrain from saying things are going on to suit you a friendly hush was the only response,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11010,6081-41998-0040,who insisted upon remaining at his orders he succeeded at last however but even when he had reached the portico on the left side of the building,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11011,6081-41998-0041,lecoq had entered the left wing of the palais he climbed the stairs till he had reached the third floor and was about to enter the long narrow badly lighted corridor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11012,6081-41998-0042,when finding a doorkeeper installed behind a heavy oaken desk he remarked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11013,6081-41998-0043,the man shook his head no said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11014,8108-274318-0000,it all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that the events that took place in this little modern room at the top of putney hill between midnight and sunrise that doctor silence was hardly able to follow and remember it all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11015,8108-274318-0001,it came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror the light was so uncertain the movements of the black cat so difficult to follow on the dark carpet and the doctor himself so weary and taken by surprise that he found it almost impossible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11016,8108-274318-0002,to observe accurately or to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen or in what order the incidents had taken place he never could understand what defect of vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had duplicated itself at first,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11017,8108-274318-0003,and then increased indefinitely so that there were at least a dozen of them darting silently about the floor leaping softly on to chairs and tables passing like shadows from the open door to the end of the room all black as sin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11018,8108-274318-0004,with brilliant green eyes flashing fire in all directions it was like the reflections from a score of mirrors placed round the walls at different angles nor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seemed to have altered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11019,8108-274318-0005,the snarling of the enraged and terrified collie sounded sometimes so far away the ceiling seemed to have raised itself so much higher than before and much of the furniture had changed in appearance and shifted marvellously it was all so confused and confusing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11020,8108-274318-0006,into the dimensions of quite another chamber that came to him with its host of cats and its strange distances in a sort of vision but these changes came about a little later and at a time when his attention was so concentrated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11021,8108-274318-0007,upon the proceedings of smoke and the collie that he only observed them as it were subconsciously and the excitement the flickering candlelight the distress he felt for the collie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11022,8108-274318-0008,were the poorest possible allies to careful observation at first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short dangerous bark from time to time snapping viciously at the empty air a foot or so from the ground once indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11023,8108-274318-0009,he sprang upwards and forwards working furiously with teeth and paws and with a noise like wolves fighting but only to dash back the next minute against the wall behind him then after lying still for a bit he rose to a crouching position,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11024,8108-274318-0010,as though to spring again snarling horribly and making short half circles with lowered head and smoke all the while meowed piteously by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon himself then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11025,8108-274318-0011,seemed to turn aside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person the collie had made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner where he made noise enough in his savage rage to waken the dead before he fell to whining,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11026,8108-274318-0012,and directly afterwards the doctor's own distress became intolerably acute he had made a half movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was denser than mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene draping room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11027,8108-274318-0013,walls animals and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also about his own mind other forms moved silently across the field of vision forms that he recognised from previous experiments and welcomed not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11028,8108-274318-0014,unholy thoughts began to crowd into his brain sinister suggestions of evil presented themselves seductively ice seemed to settle about his heart and his mind trembled he began to lose memory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11029,8108-274318-0015,memory of his identity of where he was of what he ought to do the very foundations of his strength were shaken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11030,8108-274318-0016,and it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats all dark as the night all silent all with lamping eyes of green fire the dimensions of the place altered and shifted he was in a much larger space,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11031,8108-274318-0017,the whining of the dog sounded far away and all about him the cats flew busily to and fro silently playing their tearing rushing game of evil weaving the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11032,8108-274318-0018,he strove hard to collect himself and remember the words of power he had made use of before in similar dread positions where his dangerous practice had sometimes led but he could recall nothing consecutively,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11033,8108-274318-0019,a mist lay over his mind and memory he felt dazed and his forces scattered the deeps within were too troubled for healing power to come out of them it was glamour of course he realised afterwards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11034,8108-274318-0020,the strong glamour thrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the veil but at the time he was not sufficiently aware of this and as with all true glamour was unable to grasp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11035,8108-274318-0021,behind him like wind booming and tearing its way down the windows rattled the candle flickered and went out the glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of death and a great rushing sound swept by overhead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11036,8108-274318-0022,something from the region of utter cold was upon him and then quite suddenly through the confused mists about him there slowly rose up the personality that had been all the time directing the battle some force entered his being,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11037,8108-274318-0023,that shook him as the tempest shakes a leaf and close against his eyes clean level with his face he found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark countenance a countenance that was terrible even in its ruin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11038,8108-274318-0024,and the mark of spiritual evil was branded everywhere upon its broken features eyes face and hair rose level with his own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11039,8108-274318-0025,he never could properly measure or determine these two a man and a woman looked straight into each other's visages and down into each other's hearts and john silence the soul with the good unselfish motive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11040,8108-274318-0026,held his own against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil and whose soul was on the side of the dark powers it was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began to restore him slowly to his own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11041,8108-274318-0027,he was conscious of course of effort and yet it seemed no superhuman one for he had recognised the character of his opponent's power and he called upon the good within him to meet and overcome it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11042,8108-274318-0028,the inner forces stirred and trembled in response to his call they did not at first come readily as was their habit for under the spell of glamour they had already been diabolically lulled into inactivity but come they eventually did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11043,8108-274318-0029,and power and confidence came with them he began to breathe deeply and regularly and at the same time to absorb into himself the forces opposed to him and to turn them to his own account,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11044,8108-274318-0030,by ceasing to resist and allowing the deadly stream to pour into him unopposed he used the very power supplied by his adversary and thus enormously increased his own for this spiritual alchemy he had learned he understood that force,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11045,8108-274318-0031,ultimately is everywhere one and the same it is the motive behind that makes it good or evil and his motive was entirely unselfish he knew provided he was not first robbed of self control,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11046,8108-274318-0032,how vicariously to absorb these evil radiations into himself and change them magically into his own good purposes and since his motive was pure and his soul fearless they could not work him harm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11047,8108-274318-0033,thus he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingly attracted by pender deflecting its course upon himself and after passing through the purifying filter of his own unselfishness these energies could only add to his store of experience of knowledge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11048,8108-274318-0034,and therefore of power and as his self control returned to him he gradually accomplished this purpose even though trembling while he did so yet the struggle was severe and in spite of the freezing chill of the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11049,8108-274318-0035,the perspiration poured down his face then by slow degrees the dark and dreadful countenance faded the glamour passed from his soul the normal proportions returned to walls and ceiling the forms melted back into the fog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11050,8108-274318-0036,and the whirl of rushing shadow cats disappeared whence they came and with the return of the consciousness of his own identity john silence was restored to the full control of his own will power in a deep modulated voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11051,8108-274318-0037,he made certain sigils gestures and movements at the same time for several minutes he continued to utter these words until at length the growing volume dominated the whole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11052,8108-274318-0038,for just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil forces by raising them into higher channels so he knew from long study the occult use of sound and its direct effect upon the plastic region,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11053,8108-274318-0039,wherein the powers of spiritual evil work their fell purposes harmony was restored first of all to his own soul and thence to the room and all its occupants and after himself the first to recognise it was the old dog lying in his corner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11054,8108-274318-0040,flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure that something between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being restored to their master's confidence doctor silence heard the thumping of the collie's tail against the floor and the grunt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11055,8108-274318-0041,and the thumping touched the depth of affection in the man's heart and gave him some inkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered next from the shadows by the window a somewhat shrill purring announced the restoration of the cat to its normal state,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11056,8108-274318-0042,smoke was advancing across the carpet he seemed very pleased with himself and smiled with an expression of supreme innocence he was no shadow cat but real and full of his usual and perfect self possession he marched along picking his way delicately,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11057,8108-274318-0043,clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief to which he had unwittingly lent himself owing to his subtle and electric constitution still uttering his sharp high purrings he marched up to his master and rubbed vigorously against his legs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11058,8108-274318-0044,and pawed his knees and stared beseechingly up into his face he turned his head towards the corner where the collie still lay thumping his tail feebly and pathetically john silence understood he bent down and stroked the creature's living fur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11059,8108-274318-0045,noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of his hand down its back and then they advanced together towards the corner where the dog was smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend's muzzle purring while he rubbed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11060,8108-274318-0046,and uttering little soft sounds of affection in his throat the doctor lit the candle and brought it over he saw the collie lying on its side against the wall it was utterly exhausted and foam still hung about its jaws its tail and eyes responded to the sound of its name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11061,8108-274318-0047,but it was evidently very weak and overcome smoke continued to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes sometimes even standing on its body and kneading into the thick yellow hair flame replied from time to time by little licks of the tongue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11062,8108-274318-0048,most of them curiously misdirected but doctor silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had happened and his heart was wrung he stroked the dear body feeling it over for bruises or broken bones but finding none,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11063,8108-280359-0000,for the future he must bend all his cunning and vigilance to the task of hiding himself from the gaze of those whom he had so injured and escaping the just punishment he had brought upon himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11064,8108-280359-0001,the world is large and i am very clever said loki to himself as he turned his back upon asgard and wandered out into manheim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11065,8108-280359-0002,and no measure for the deep waters neither is there any possibility of counting the various forms under which i shall disguise myself odin will never be able to find me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11066,8108-280359-0003,i have no cause to fear but though loki repeated this over and over again to himself he was afraid he wandered far into the thick woods and covered himself with the deep waters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11067,8108-280359-0004,he climbed to the tops of misty hills and crouched in the dark of hollow caves but above the wood and through the water and down into the darkness a single ray of calm clear light seemed always to follow him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11068,8108-280359-0005,and he knew that it came from the eye of odin who was watching him from air throne then he tried to escape the watchful eye by disguising himself under various shapes sometimes he was an eagle on a lonely mountain crag,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11069,8108-280359-0006,sometimes he hid himself as one among a troop of timid reindeer sometimes he lay in the nest of a wood pigeon sometimes he swam a bright spotted fish in the sea but wherever he was among living creatures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11070,8108-280359-0007,or alone with dead nature everything seemed to know him and to find a voice in which to say to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11071,8108-280359-0008,air earth or water there was no rest for him anywhere tired at last of seeking what he could nowhere find loki built himself a house near a narrow glittering river which lower down flashed from a high rock into the sea below,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11072,8108-280359-0009,he took care that his house should have four doors in it that he might look out on every side and catch the first glimpse of the gods when they came as he knew they would come to take him away here his wife siguna and his two sons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11073,8108-280359-0010,ali and nari came to live with him siguna was a kind woman far too good and kind for loki she felt sorry for him now that she saw he was in great fear and that every living thing had turned against him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11074,8108-280359-0011,and she would have hidden him from the just anger of the gods if she could but the two sons cared little about their father's dread and danger they spent all their time in quarreling with each other and their loud angry voices sounding above the waterfall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11075,8108-280359-0012,would speedily have betrayed the hiding place even if odin's piercing eye had not already found it out at last one day when he was sitting in the middle of his house looking alternately out of all the four doors and amusing himself as well as he could,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11076,8108-280359-0013,by making a fishing net he spied in the distance the whole company of the gods approaching his house the sight of them coming all together beautiful and noble and free pierced loki with a pang that was worse than death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11077,8108-280359-0014,he rose without daring to look again threw his net on a fire that burned on the floor and rushing to the side of the little river he turned himself into a salmon swam down to the deepest stillest pool at the bottom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11078,8108-280359-0015,and hid himself between two stones the gods entered the house and looked all round in vain for loki,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11079,8108-280359-0016,famous for his keen sight spied out the remains of the fishing net in the fire then odin knew at once that there was a river near and that it was there where loki had hidden himself he ordered his sons to make a new net and to cast it into the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11080,8108-280359-0017,and drag out whatever living thing they could find there it was done as he desired thor held one end of the net and all the rest of the gods drew the other through the water when they pulled it up the first time however it was empty and they would have gone away disappointed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11081,8108-280359-0018,saw that something living had certainly touched them they then added a weight to the net and threw it with such force that it reached the bottom of the river and dragged up the stones in the pool loki now saw the danger he was in of being caught in the net and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11082,8108-280359-0019,but not so quickly but that the gods saw him knew him through his disguise and resolved that he should no longer escape they themselves divided into two bands thor waded down the river to the waterfall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11083,8108-280359-0020,the other gods stood in a group below loki swam backwards and forwards between them first he thought he would dart out into the sea and then that he would spring over the net back again into the river this last seemed the easiest way of escape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11084,8108-280359-0021,and with the greatest speed he attempted it thor however was watching for him and as soon as loki leaped out of the water he stretched out his hand and caught him while he was yet turning in the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11085,8108-280359-0022,loki wriggled his slippery slimy length through thor's fingers but the thunderer grasped him tightly by the tail and holding him in this manner in this hand waded to the shore there father odin and the other gods met him and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11086,8108-280359-0023,at odin's first searching look loki was obliged to drop his disguise and cowering and frightened to assume his proper shape before the assembled lords one by one they turned their faces from him for in looking at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11087,8108-280359-0024,they seemed to see over again the death of baldur the beloved you were told that there were high rocks looking over the sea near loki's house one of these higher than the rest had midway four projecting stones and to these the gods resolved to bind loki,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11088,8108-280359-0025,be able to torment the inhabitants of manheim or asgard by his evil doings thor proposed to return to asgard to bring a chain with which to bind the prisoner but odin assured him that he had no need to take such a journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11089,8108-280359-0026,loki he said has already forged for himself a chain stronger than any you can make while we have been occupied in catching him his two sons ali and nari transformed into wolves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11090,8108-280359-0027,by their evil passions have fought with and destroyed each other with their sinews we must make a chain to bind their father and from that he can never escape it was done as asa odin said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11091,8108-280359-0028,a rope was made of the dead wolves sinews and as soon as it touched loki's body it turned into bands of iron,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11092,8108-280354-0000,jason had persuaded orpheus to accompany the argonauts when they went to fetch back the golden fleece for he knew that the perils of the way would be lightened by song to the sound of his lyre the argo had floated down to the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11093,8108-280354-0001,and he played so sweetly when they passed the rocks of the sirens that the dreadful monsters sang their most alluring strains in vain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11094,8108-280354-0002,whom he loved dearly and who returned his love but at their marriage the omens were not favorable hymen the marriage god came to it with a gloomy countenance and the wedding torches smoked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11095,8108-280354-0003,and would not give forth a cheerful flame,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11096,8108-280354-0004,was to be but short lived for as the new made bride wandered through the woods with the other nymphs a poisonous serpent stung her heel and no remedy availed to save her orpheus was thrown,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11097,8108-280354-0005,into most passionate grief at his wife's death he could not believe that he had lost her for ever but prayed day and night without ceasing to the gods above to restore her to him when they would not listen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11098,8108-280354-0006,he resolved to make one last effort to win her back he would go down to the lower world and seek her among the dead and try whether any prayer or persuasion could move pluto to restore his beloved near taenarum,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11099,8108-280354-0007,in laconia was a cave among dark and gloomy rocks through which led one of the entrances to the lower world this was the road by which hercules descended when he went to carry off cerberus,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11100,8108-280354-0008,the three headed dog that guards the threshold of pluto undaunted by the terrors of the place orpheus passed through this gate and down a dark and dismal road to the kingdom of the dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11101,8108-280354-0009,here he came in safety through the crowd of ghosts and phantoms and stood at last before the throne of pluto and proserpina then he touched the chords of his lyre and chanted these words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11102,8108-280354-0010,great lords of the world below the earth to which all we mortals must one day come grant me to tell a simple tale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11103,8108-280354-0011,the lifeless ghosts came flocking and as they heard they wept tantalus forgot his hunger and thirst,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11104,8108-280354-0012,sat on his stone to listen never yet had such sweet strains been heard in the world of gloom then for the first time tears moistened the cheeks of the furies and even the king and queen of the dead were moved to pity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11105,8108-280354-0013,and she came yet halting from her recent wound take her says pluto and lead her back to the light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11106,8108-280354-0014,nor must you once turn round to look upon her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11107,8108-280354-0015,else the boon we grant you will be but vain a steep path led upward from the realm of darkness and the way was hard to find through the gloom in silence orpheus led on till the goal was close at hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11108,8108-280354-0016,and the welcoming light of the upper air began to penetrate the darkness then a sudden fear struck his heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11109,8108-280354-0017,he turned to gaze on his beloved dimly he saw her but for the last time for a power she could not resist drew her back orpheus stretched out his arms and tried to seize her but he only clasped the empty air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11110,8108-280354-0018,he sat on the further bank without food or drink,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11111,8108-280354-0019,then at last he knew that the gods below were pitiless and full of sorrow he returned to the upper earth for three years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11112,8108-280354-0020,finding his only consolation in the music of his lyre for he shunned all men and women,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11113,8108-280354-0021,one day he sat down to rest on a grassy hill in the sunshine and played and sang to beguile his sorrow as he played the coolness of shady branches seemed all about him and looking up he found himself in the midst of a wood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11114,8108-280354-0022,oak poplar lime beech laurel ash pine plane and maple and many another tree had gathered together here drawn from their distant forest homes by the sounds of orpheus's lyre,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11115,8108-280354-0023,yes and the beasts and the birds of the field came too and orpheus sat in their midst and sang and played the tunes of sorrow suddenly a great noise was heard of laughter and shouting and merry making,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11116,8108-280354-0024,for this was one of the feasts of bacchus and the women were celebrating his rites wandering over the mountains with dance and revel when they saw orpheus they set up a shout of derision see they cried,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11117,8108-280354-0025,the wretched singer who mocks at women and will have no bride but the dead come let us kill him and show that no man shall despise us unpunished with these words they began to throw wands and stones at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11118,8108-280354-0026,and fell harmlessly to the ground then the women raised a wild shout and made such a clamor with trumpets and cymbals that the soft tones of the harp were drowned by the noise now at last the shots took effect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11119,8108-280354-0027,and in their fury the women fell upon him dealing blow on blow orpheus fell lifeless to the ground but he was not to die unwept the little birds of the forest mourned for him even the stony rocks wept,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11120,8108-280354-0028,the trees shed their leaves with grief and the dryads and naiads tore their hair and put on the garb of sorrow only the pitiless revelers knew no remorse they seized the singer's head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11121,8108-280354-0029,and threw it with his lyre into the river hebrus there it floated down stream and strange to tell the chords gave forth a lament and the lifeless tongue uttered words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11122,8108-280354-0030,it cried till head and lyre were carried down to the sea and on to lesbos the isle of sweet song where in after years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11124,5022-29405-0000,time has passed since i first read it and changes have occurred in the interval which leave me free to exercise my own discretion and to let the autobiography speak for itself if i am asked what impression of the writer those extraordinary pages produced on me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11127,5022-29405-0003,at one time his tone in writing of his early life and his allusions to his mother won my sympathy and respect at another time the picture of himself in his later years and the defiant manner in which he presented it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11147,5022-29405-0023,she smiled and kissed her hand and fluttered out of the room charming perfectly charming and yet i was ungrateful enough to wish myself back in germany again i lit my cigar but not on the terrace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11148,5022-29405-0024,leaving the house i took the way once more that led to fordwitch wood what would missus roylake have said if she had discovered that i was going back to the mill there was no other alternative the portfolio was a trust confided to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11149,5022-29405-0025,the sooner i returned it to the writer of the confession the sooner i told him plainly the conclusion at which i had arrived the more at ease my mind would be the sluggish river looked muddier than ever the new cottage looked uglier than ever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11150,5022-29405-0026,i knocked at the door on the ancient side of the building,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11151,5022-29405-0027,he stared at me in momentary perplexity and suddenly recovering himself asked me to walk in are you the young master sir ah yes yes i thought so my girl cristy said she saw the young master last night thank you kindly sir i'm pretty well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11152,5022-29405-0028,my meals don't show on me you will excuse my receiving you in the kitchen sir it's the best room we have did cristy tell you how badly we are off here for repairs you being our landlord we look to you to help us we are falling to pieces as it were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11153,5022-29405-0029,on this old side of the house there's first drains he proceeded to reckon up the repairs counting with his fleshless thumb on his skinny fingers when he was interrupted by a curious succession of sounds which began with whining and ended with scratching at the cottage door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11154,5022-29405-0030,in a minute after the door was opened from without a brown dog of the companionable retriever breed ran in and fawned upon old toller cristel followed from the kitchen garden with a basket of vegetables on her arm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11155,5022-29405-0031,i now saw in their full beauty the luster of her brown eyes the warm rosiness of her dark complexion the delightful vivacity of expression which was the crowning charm of her face she paused confusedly in the doorway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11156,5022-29405-0032,and tried to resist me when i insisted on relieving her of the basket mister gerard she protested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11157,5022-29405-0033,my answer would no doubt have assumed the form of a foolish compliment if her father had not spared her that infliction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11158,5022-29405-0034,he says all right and he does nothing there's first as i told you just now the truly dreadful state of the drains i tried to stop him by promising to speak to the bailiff myself on hearing this good news mister toller's gratitude became ungovernable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11159,5022-29405-0035,he was more eager than ever and more eloquent than ever in returning to the repairs and then sir there's the oven they do call bread the staff of life it's a burnt staff at one time and a clammy staff at another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11160,5022-29405-0036,his daughter interfered and stopped him at the critical moment when he was actually offering his arm to conduct me in state across the kitchen cristel had just put her pretty brown hand over his mouth and said oh father do pray be quiet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11161,5022-29405-0037,when we were all three disturbed by another interruption a second door communicating as i concluded from its position with the new cottage was suddenly opened in the instant before the person behind it appeared the dog looked that way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11162,5022-29405-0038,started up frightened and took refuge under the table at the next moment the deaf lodger walked into the room it was he beyond all doubt who had frightened the dog forewarned by instinct of his appearance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11163,5022-29405-0039,what i had read of his writing disposed me now that i saw the man by daylight to find something devilish in the expression of his face no strong as it was my prejudice failed to make any discoveries that presented him at a disadvantage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11164,5022-29405-0040,his personal attractions triumphed in the clear searching light i now perceived that his eyes were of that deeply dark blue which is commonly and falsely described as resembling the color of the violet to my thinking they were so entirely beautiful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11165,5022-29405-0041,that they had no right to be in a man's face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11166,5022-29405-0042,to the soft profusion of his reddish brown hair to his finely shaped sensitive lips but for two marked peculiarities in him which would have shown me to be wrong that is to say the expression of power about his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11167,5022-29405-0043,and the signs of masculine resolution presented by his mouth and chin on entering the room the first person and the only person who attracted his attention was cristel he bowed smiled possessed himself abruptly of her hand and kissed it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11168,5022-29411-0000,my loyalty towards the afflicted man whose friendly advances i had seen good reason to return was in no sense shaken his undeserved misfortunes his manly appeal to me at the spring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11169,5022-29411-0001,still while cristel's entreaties and cristel's influence had failed to shake me gloody's strange language and gloody's incomprehensible conduct had troubled my mind i felt vaguely uneasy irritated by my own depression of spirits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11170,5022-29411-0002,if i had been a philosopher i should have recognized the symptoms of a very common attack of a very widely spread moral malady the meanest of all human infirmities is also the most universal and the name of it is self esteem,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11171,5022-29411-0003,it is perhaps only right to add that my patience had been tried by the progress of domestic events which affected lady lena and myself viewed as victims calling with my stepmother at lord uppercliff's house later in the day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11172,5022-29411-0004,or made an opportunity of talking together confidentially in a corner and once or twice i caught them looking at lady lena and at me even lord uppercliff perhaps not yet taken into their confidence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11173,5022-29411-0005,noticed the proceedings of the two ladies and seemed to be at a loss to understand them when missus roylake and i were together again on our way home i was prepared to hear the praise of lady lena followed by a delicate examination into the state of my heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11174,5022-29411-0006,neither of these anticipations was realized once more my clever stepmother had puzzled me missus roylake talked as fluently as ever exhausting one common place subject after another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11175,5022-29411-0007,without the slightest allusion to my lord's daughter to my matrimonial prospects or to my visits at the mill i was secretly annoyed feeling that my stepmother's singular indifference to domestic interests of paramount importance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11176,5022-29411-0008,returning to the house i tried to occupy myself with my collection of insects sadly neglected of late useless my own moths failed to interest me i went back to the garden passing the open window of one of the lower rooms which looked out on the terrace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11177,5022-29411-0009,i saw missus roylake reading a book in sad colored binding she was yawning over it fearfully when she discovered that i was looking at her equal to any emergency this remarkable woman instantly handed to me a second and similar volume,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11178,5022-29411-0010,i looked at the book i opened the book i recovered my presence of mind and handed it back if a female humbug was on one side of the window a male humbug was on the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11179,5022-29411-0011,which way did i turn my steps men will wonder what possessed me women will think it a proceeding that did me credit i took the familiar road which led to the gloomy wood and the guilty river the longing in me to see cristel again was more than i could resist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11180,5022-29411-0012,not because i was in love with her only because i had left her in distress beyond the spring and within a short distance of the river i saw a lady advancing towards me on the path which led from the mill brisk smiling tripping along like a young girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11181,5022-29411-0013,behold the mock republican known in our neighborhood as lady rachel she held out both hands to me but for her petticoats i should have thought i had met with a jolly young man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11182,5022-29411-0014,patronizing piety on the way to afternoon church i must positively make a sketch of the cottage by the mill i mean of course the picturesque side of it that fine girl of toller's was standing at the door she is really handsomer than ever are you going to see her you wicked man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11183,5022-29411-0015,when we had left each other i thought of the absent captain in the navy who was lady rachel's husband he was a perfect stranger but i put myself in his place and felt that i too should have gone to sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11184,5022-29411-0016,old toller was alone in his kitchen evidently annoyed and angry we are all at sixes and sevens mister gerard i've had another row with that deaf devil my new name for him and i think it's rather clever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11185,5022-29411-0017,he swears sir that he won't go at the end of his week's notice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11186,5022-29411-0018,and shoot the man and shoot himself aha,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11187,5022-29411-0019,i'll be even with him you mark my words i'll be even with him that old toller the most exasperating of men judged by a quick temper had irritated my friend into speaking rashly was plain enough nevertheless i felt some anxiety,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11188,5022-29411-0020,about cristel after looking round the kitchen again i asked where she was sitting forlorn in her bedroom crying her father told me i went out for a walk by the river and i sat down and being sunday i fell asleep when i woke and got home again just now that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11189,5022-29411-0021,was how i found her i don't like to hear my girl crying she's as good as gold and better no sir our deaf devil is not to blame for this he has given cristy no reason to complain of him she says so herself and she never told a lie yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11190,5022-29411-0022,but mister toller i objected something must have happened to distress her has she not told you what it is not she obstinate about it leaves me to guess it's clear to my mind mister gerard that somebody has got at her in my absence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11191,5022-29411-0023,you will ask me who the person is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11192,5022-29411-0024,but you mean to try yes i mean to try he answered me with little of the energy which generally distinguished him perhaps he was fatigued or perhaps he had something else to think of i offered a suggestion when we are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11193,5022-29411-0025,in want of help i said we sometimes find it nearer than we had ventured to expect at our own doors the ancient miller rose at that hint like a fish at a fly gloody he cried find him at once mister toller,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11194,5022-29411-0026,i've got burdens on my mind he explained or i should have thought of it too having done justice to his own abilities he bustled out in less than a minute he was back again in a state of breathless triumph gloody has seen the person he announced and,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11195,5022-29411-0027,i beckoned to gloody waiting modestly at the door to come in and tell me what he had discovered i saw her outside sir rapping at the door here with her parasol that was the servant's report her parasol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11196,5022-29411-0028,miss cristel looked like a person surprised at seeing a stranger what i should call a free and easy stranger she walked in sir as if the place belonged to her i am not suspicious by nature as i hope and believe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11197,5022-29411-0029,the hat i had seen on the head of that hateful woman was now sufficiently described for a man sly old toller leaving gloody unnoticed and keeping his eye on me saw the signs of conviction in my face and said with his customary audacity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11198,5022-29411-0030,who is she i followed at my humble distance the example of sir walter scott when inquisitive people asked him if he was the author of the waverley novels in plain english i denied all knowledge of the stranger wearing the green hat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11199,5022-29411-0031,but i was naturally desirous of discovering next what lady rachel had said and i asked to speak with cristel her far seeing father might or might not have perceived a chance of listening to our conversation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11209,5022-29411-0041,on the river margin of the wood i was confronted by a wild gleam of beauty in the familiar view for which previous experience had not prepared me am i wrong in believing that all scenery no matter how magnificent or how homely it may be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11211,5022-29411-0043,and the lurid reddening of the sun as it stooped to its setting lovely interfusions of sobered color rested faded returned again on the upper leaves of the foliage as they lightly moved the mist rolling capriciously over the waters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11212,5022-29411-0044,while it dimmed the turbid earthy yellow that discolored and degraded the stream under the full glare of day while my eyes followed the successive transformations of the view as the hour advanced tender and solemn influences breathed their balm over my mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11216,5022-29411-0048,a visible hand touched my arm as i turned suddenly a living breath played on my face the child had faded into a vanishing shade the perfected woman who had grown from her had stolen on me unawares and was asking me to pardon her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11222,5022-29411-0054,her manner had become quieter her face was more composed her expression almost recovered its natural charm while she spoke of lady rachel i was stupefied try sir to forget it and forgive it she resumed gently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11223,5022-29411-0055,if i have misbehaved myself i don't rightly know what i am saying or doing i pointed to the new side of the cottage behind us is the cause there i asked no no indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11224,5022-29411-0056,in that short time i told her that he had been found in my garden looking at the flowers as he had done no harm i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11225,5022-29411-0057,and felt i don't doubt it i had intended to say no more than this but the remembrance of gloody's mysterious prevarication and of the uneasiness which i had undoubtedly felt when i thought of it afterwards led me i cannot pretend to say how,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11226,5022-29411-0058,into associating cristel's agitation with something which this man might have said to her i was on the point of putting the question when she held up her hand and said hush the wind was blowing towards us from the river side village to which i have already alluded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11227,5022-29411-0059,i am not sure whether i have mentioned that the name of the place was kylam it was situated behind a promontory of the river bank clothed thickly with trees and was not visible from the mill in the present direction of the wind we could hear the striking of the church clock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11228,5022-29411-0060,cristel counted the strokes seven she said are you determined to keep your engagement she had repeated in an unsteady voice and with a sudden change in her color to paleness the strange question put to me by gloody,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11231,5022-29411-0063,it's too late now instead of letting me precede her as i had anticipated she ran on before me made a sign to the deaf man as she passed him not to stop her and disappeared through the open door of her father's side of the cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11232,5022-29411-0064,i was left to decide for myself what should i have done if i had been twenty years older,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11233,5022-29411-0065,the fear of appearing to be afraid and that i should have made my excuses to my host of the evening how would my moral courage have answered him if he had asked for an explanation useless to speculate on it had i possessed the wisdom of middle life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11234,5022-29411-0066,his book of leaves would not have told him in my own handwriting that i believed in his better nature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11238,5022-29411-0070,to day she's in her room praying the warnings which i had neglected rose in judgment against me i was silent i was awed before i recovered myself cristel entered the kitchen her father whispered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11239,3374-298025-0000,an old man in agony but still genial and full of delicate wit drapes the motley spectacle of his lifelike writings with the costly tapestry of a preface which in itself is a beautiful and romantic painting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11240,3374-298025-0001,but what shall my spirit bestow upon its offspring which like its parent is as poor in poesy as it is rich in love just one word a parting trope,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11241,3374-298025-0002,it is not alone the royal eagle who may despise the croaking of the raven the swan too is proud and takes no note of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11242,3374-298025-0003,human beings and what they want and do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11243,3374-298025-0004,a fresh warm breath of life and love fanned me rustling and stirring in all the branches of the verdant grove i gazed and enjoyed it all the rich green the white blossoms and the golden fruit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11244,3374-298025-0005,and in my mind's eye i saw too in many forms my one and only beloved now as a little girl now as a young lady in the full bloom and energy of love and womanhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11245,3374-298025-0006,and now as a dignified mother with her demure babe in her arms i breathed the spring and i saw clearly all about me everlasting youth smiling i said to myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11246,3374-298025-0007,from this feeling or thought nothing could have turned me neither general despair nor personal fear for i believed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11247,3374-298025-0008,but i gladly lost myself in all those blendings and intertwinings of joy and pain from which spring the spice of life and the flower of feeling spiritual pleasure as well as sensual bliss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11248,3374-298025-0009,a subtle fire flowed through my veins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11249,3374-298025-0010,it was not only the wish to relieve the tormenting sting of my desire and to cool the sweet fire by gratification it was not for your lips that i longed or for your eyes or for your body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11250,3374-298025-0011,a marvelous mingling of memories and desires all the mysteries of caprice in man and woman seemed to hover about me when suddenly in my solitude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11251,3374-298025-0012,and yet with calm presence of mind i watched for the slightest sign of joy in you so that not one should escape me to impair the harmony i not only enjoyed but i felt and enjoyed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11252,3374-298025-0013,the enjoyment you are so extraordinarily clever dearest lucinda that you have doubtless long ere this begun to suspect that this is all nothing but a beautiful dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11253,3374-298025-0014,not long ago i was standing by the window how long i do not know for along with the other rules of reason and morality i completely forgot about the lapse of time well i was standing by the window and looking out into the open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11254,3374-298025-0015,the morning certainly deserves to be called beautiful the air is still and quite warm and the verdure here before me is fresh and even as the wide land undulates in hills and dales,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11255,3374-298025-0016,so the calm broad silvery river winds along in great bends and sweeps until it and the lover's fantasy cradled upon it like the swan pass away into the distance and lose themselves in the immeasurable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11256,3374-298025-0017,my vision doubtless owes the grove and its southern color effect to the huge mass of flowers here beside me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11258,3374-298025-0019,all except that not long ago i was standing by the window and doing nothing and that i am now sitting here and doing something something which is perhaps little more than nothing perhaps even less,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11259,3374-298025-0020,i was just on the point of unfolding to you in clear and precise periods the exact and straightforward history of our frivolities and of my dulness i was going to expound to you step by step,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11260,3374-298025-0021,in accordance with natural laws the misunderstandings that attack the hidden centre of the loveliest existence and to confess to you the manifold effects of my awkwardness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11261,3374-298025-0022,i was about to describe the apprenticeship of my manhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11262,3374-298025-0023,a period which taken as a whole or in parts i can never look back upon without a great deal of inward amusement a little melancholy and considerable self satisfaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11263,3374-298025-0024,still as a refined lover and writer i will endeavor to refashion the coarse occurrence and adapt it to my purpose for me and for this book however for my love of it and for its inner development,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11264,3374-298025-0025,there is no better adaptation of means to ends than this namely that right at the start i begin by abolishing what we call orderly arrangement keep myself entirely aloof from it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11265,3374-298025-0026,frankly claiming and asserting the right to a charming confusion this is all the more necessary inasmuch as the material which our life and love offers to my spirit and to my pen is so incessantly progressive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11266,3374-298025-0027,and so inflexibly systematic if the form were also of that character this in its way unique letter would then acquire an intolerable unity and monotony,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11267,3374-298025-0028,so i use my incontestable right to a confused style by inserting here in the wrong place one of the many incoherent sheets which i once filled with rubbish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11268,3374-298025-0029,it was written in a mood of impatient longing due to my not finding you where i most surely expected to find you in your room on our sofa in the haphazard words suggested by the pen you had lately been using,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11269,3374-298025-0030,the selection is not difficult for since among the dreamy fancies which are here confided to you in permanent letters the recollection of this most beautiful world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11270,3374-298025-0031,is the most significant and has a certain sort of resemblance to what they call thought i choose in preference to anything else a dithyrambic fantasy on the most lovely of situations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11271,3374-298025-0032,for once we know to a certainty that we live in a most beautiful world the next need is obvious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11272,3374-298026-0000,it looks at me joyously out of its deep eyes and opens its arms to embrace my spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11273,3374-298026-0001,the holiest and most evanescent of those delicate traits and utterances of the soul which to one who does not know the highest seem like bliss itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11274,3374-298026-0002,are merely the common atmosphere of our spiritual breath and life the words are weak and vague,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11275,3374-298026-0003,furthermore in this throng of impressions i could only repeat anew the one inexhaustible feeling of our original harmony a great future beckons me on into the immeasurable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11276,3374-298026-0004,each idea develops a countless progeny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11277,3374-298026-0005,i remember everything even the griefs and all my thoughts that have been and are to be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11278,3374-298026-0006,the blood rushes wildly through my swollen veins my mouth thirsts for the contact of your lips and my fancy seeks vainly among the many forms of joy for one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11279,3374-298026-0007,which might at last gratify my desire and give it rest and then again i suddenly and sadly bethink me of the gloomy time when i was always waiting without hope,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11280,3374-298026-0008,and madly loving without knowing it when my innermost being overflowed with a vague longing which it breathed forth but rarely in half suppressed sighs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11281,3374-298026-0009,oh i should have thought it all a fairy tale that there could be such joy such love as i now feel and such a woman who could be my most tender beloved my best companion and at the same time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11282,3374-298026-0010,a perfect friend for it was in friendship especially that i sought for what i wanted and for what i never hoped to find in any woman in you i found it all and more than i could wish for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11283,3374-298026-0011,you know nothing the womanliness of your soul aside from minor peculiarities consists in its regarding life and love as the same thing for you all feeling is infinite and eternal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11284,3374-298026-0012,you recognize no separations your being is an indivisible unity that is why you are so serious and so joyous why you regard everything in such a large and indifferent way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11285,3374-298026-0013,that is why you love me all of me and will surrender no part of me to the state to posterity or to manly pleasures i am all yours we are closest to each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11286,3374-298026-0014,and we understand each other you accompany me through all the stages of manhood from the utmost wantonness to the most refined spirituality in you alone i first saw true pride,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11287,3374-298026-0015,and true feminine humility the most extreme suffering if it is only surrounded without separating us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11288,3374-298026-0016,would seem to me nothing but a charming antithesis to the sublime frivolity of our marriage why should we not take the harshest whim of chance for an excellent jest and a most frolicsome caprice since we,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11289,3374-298026-0017,like our love are immortal i can no longer say my love and your love they are both alike in their perfect mutuality marriage is the everlasting unity and alliance of our spirits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11290,3374-298026-0018,as that last glass of champagne we drank together when i said and so let us drink out the rest of our lives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11291,3374-298026-0019,and so i say again let us live and love i know you would not wish to survive me you would rather follow your dying husband into his coffin gladly and lovingly would you descend into the burning abyss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11292,3374-298026-0020,even as the women of india do impelled by a mad law the cruel constraining purpose of which desecrates and destroys the most delicate sanctities of the will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11293,3374-298026-0021,on the other side perhaps longing will be more completely realized i often wonder over it every thought and whatever else is fashioned within us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11294,3374-298026-0022,seems to be complete in itself as single and indivisible as a person one thing crowds out another and that which just now was near and present soon sinks back into obscurity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11295,3374-298026-0023,and then again come moments of sudden and universal clarity when several such spirits of the inner world completely fuse together into a wonderful wedlock and many a forgotten bit of our ego shines forth in a new light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11296,3374-298026-0024,and even illuminates the darkness of the future with its bright lustre as it is in a small way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11297,3374-298026-0025,i think in a large way that which we call a life is for the complete inner immortal man only a single idea an indivisible feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11298,3374-298026-0026,and for him there come too moments of the profoundest and fullest consciousness when all lives fall together and mingle and separate in a different way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11299,3374-298026-0027,the time is coming when we two shall behold in one spirit that we are blossoms of one plant or petals of one flower we shall then know with a smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11300,3374-298026-0028,that what we now call merely hope was really memory do you know how the first seed of this idea germinated in my soul before you and took root in yours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11301,3374-298026-0029,weave our love ever and ever more closely and firmly together just as a child like an echo doubles the happiness of its gentle parents nothing can part us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11302,3374-298026-0030,and certainly any separation would only draw me more powerfully to you i bethink me how at our last embrace you vehemently resisting i burst into simultaneous tears and laughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11303,3374-298026-0031,i tried to calm myself and in a sort of bewilderment i would not believe that i was separated from you until the surrounding objects convinced me of it against my will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11304,3374-298026-0032,but then my longing grew again irresistible until on its wings i sank back into your arms suppose words or a human being to create a misunderstanding between us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11305,3374-298026-0033,the poignant grief would be transient and quickly resolve itself into complete harmony how could separation separate us when presence itself is to us as it were too present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11306,3374-298026-0034,we have to cool and mitigate the consuming fire with jests and thus for us the most witty of the forms and situations of joy is also the most beautiful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11307,3374-298026-0035,it is not merely the delight of exhaustion or the anticipation of revenge i see in it a wonderful and profoundly significant allegory of the development of man and woman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11308,3374-298026-0036,into complete humanity that was my dithyrambic fantasy on the loveliest situation in the loveliest of worlds i know right well what you thought of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11309,3374-298026-0037,and how you took it at that time and i think i know just as well what you will think of it and how you will take it here here in this little book in which you expect to find genuine history plain truth and calm reason,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11310,3374-298026-0038,yes even morality the charming morality of love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11311,3374-298026-0039,how can a man wish to write anything which it is scarcely permissible to talk about which ought only to be felt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11312,3374-298026-0040,i replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11313,3374-298026-0041,a man feels it he must wish to talk about it and what a man wishes to talk about he may write,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11314,3374-298026-0042,i wanted first to demonstrate to you that there exists in the original and essential nature of man a certain awkward enthusiasm which likes to utter boldly that which is delicate and holy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11315,3374-298026-0043,and sometimes falls headlong over its own honest zeal and speaks a word that is divine to the point of coarseness this apology would indeed save me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11316,3374-298026-0044,but perhaps only at the enormous expense of my manhood itself for whatever you may think of my manhood in particular you have nevertheless a great deal against the sex in general,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11317,3374-298026-0045,meantime i will by no means make common cause with them but will rather excuse and defend my liberty and audacity by means of the example of the little innocent wilhelmina,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11318,3374-298026-0046,since she too is a lady whom i love most tenderly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11319,3374-298032-0000,the children are justified when they peep so curiously and timidly at a company of unknown faces each individual atom of everlasting time is capable of comprising a world of joy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11320,3374-298032-0001,and at the same time of opening up a fathomless abyss of pain and suffering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11321,3374-298032-0002,i understand now the old fairy tale about the man whom the sorcerer allowed to live a great many years in a few moments for i know by my own experience the terrible omnipotence of the fantasy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11322,3374-298032-0003,since the last letter from your sister it is three days now i have undergone the sufferings of an entire life from the bright sunlight of glowing youth to the pale moonlight of sagacious old age,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11323,3374-298032-0004,every little detail she wrote about your sickness taken with what i had already gleaned from the doctor and had observed myself confirmed my suspicion that it was far more dangerous than you thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11324,3374-298032-0005,indeed no longer dangerous but decided past hope lost in this thought and my strength entirely exhausted on account of the impossibility of hurrying to your side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11325,3374-298032-0006,my state of mind was really very disconsolate now for the first time i understand what it really was being new born by the joyful news that you are well again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11326,3374-298032-0007,i did not think of it as about to happen in the future or even in the present everything was already past for a long time you had been wrapt in the bosom of the cold earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11327,3374-298032-0008,flowers had started to grow on the beloved grave and my tears had already begun to flow more gently mute and alone i stood and saw nothing but the features i had loved and the sweet glances of the expressive eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11328,3374-298032-0009,now and then the pale face smiled and seemed asleep just as it had looked the last time i saw it then of a sudden the different memories all became confused,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11329,3374-298032-0010,with unbelievable rapidity the outlines changed reassumed their first form and transformed themselves again and again until the wild vision vanished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11330,3374-298032-0011,only your holy eyes remained in the empty space and hung there motionless even as the friendly stars shine eternally over our poverty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11331,3374-298032-0012,now a piercing pain from dark suns burned me with an insupportable glare now a beautiful radiance hovered about as if to entice me then i seemed to feel a fresh breath of morning air fan me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11332,3374-298032-0013,i held my head up and cried aloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11333,3374-298032-0014,why should you torment yourself in a few minutes you can be with her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11334,3374-298032-0015,i was already hastening to you when suddenly a new thought held me back and i said to my spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11335,3374-298032-0016,unworthy man you cannot even endure the trifling dissonances of this ordinary life and yet you regard yourself as ready for and worthy of a higher life go away and do and suffer as your calling is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11336,3374-298032-0017,and then present yourself again when your orders have been executed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11337,3374-298032-0018,is it not to you also remarkable how everything on this earth moves toward the centre how orderly everything is how insignificant and trivial so it has always seemed to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11338,3374-298032-0019,and for that reason i suspect if i am not mistaken i have already imparted my suspicion to you that the next life will be larger and in the good as well as in the bad stronger wilder bolder and more tremendous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11339,3374-298032-0020,as when a person suddenly finds himself alone in the midst of immeasurable mountains of ice everything about me and in me was cold and strange and even my tears froze,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11340,3374-298032-0021,wonderful worlds appeared and vanished before me in my uneasy dream i was sick and suffered great pain but i loved my sickness and welcomed the suffering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11341,3374-298032-0022,i hated everything earthly and was glad to see it all punished and destroyed i felt so alone and so strangely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11342,3374-298032-0023,and as a delicate spirit often grows melancholy in the very lap of happiness over its own joy and at the very acme of its existence becomes conscious of the futility of it all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11343,3374-298032-0024,so did i regard my suffering with mysterious pleasure i regarded it as the symbol of life in general i believed that i was seeing and feeling the everlasting discord,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11344,3374-298032-0025,and the lovely forms of refined culture seemed dead and trivial to me in comparison with this monstrous world of infinite strength and of unending struggle and warfare,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11345,3374-298032-0026,even into the most hidden depths of existence on account of this remarkable feeling sickness acquired the character of a peculiar world complete in itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11346,3374-298032-0027,i felt that its mysterious life was richer and deeper than the vulgar health of the dreaming sleep walkers all around me and with the sickliness which was not at all unpleasant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11347,3374-298032-0028,this feeling also clung to me and completely separated me from other men just as i was sundered from the earth by the thought that your nature and my love had been too sacred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11348,3374-298032-0029,it seemed to me that all was right so and that your unavoidable death was nothing more than a gentle awakening after a light sleep i too thought that i was awake when i saw your picture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11349,3374-298032-0030,which evermore transfigured itself into a cheerful diffused purity serious and yet charming quite you and yet no longer you the divine form irradiated by a wonderful light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11350,3374-298032-0031,now it was like the terrible gleam of visible omnipotence now like a soft ray of golden childhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11351,3374-298032-0032,because every earthly sentiment was entirely strange to me and the feeling never left me that i was consecrated to death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11352,3374-298032-0033,the years passed slowly by and deeds and works advanced laboriously to their goal one after the other a goal that seemed as little mine as the deeds and works seemed to be what they are called,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11353,3374-298032-0034,to me they were merely holy symbols and everything brought me back to my one beloved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11354,3374-298032-0035,and the one eternal and indivisible humanity all existence was an uninterrupted divine service of solitary love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11355,3374-298032-0036,finally i became conscious that it was now nearly over the brow was no longer smooth and the locks were becoming gray my career was ended but not completed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11356,3374-298032-0037,the best strength of life was gone and still art and virtue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11357,3374-298032-0038,stood ever unattainable before me i should have despaired had i not perceived and idolized both in you gracious madonna and you and your gentle godliness in myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11358,3374-298032-0039,then you appeared to me beckoning with the summons of death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11359,3374-298032-0040,an earnest longing for you and for freedom seized me i yearned for my dear old fatherland and was about to shake off the dust of travel when i was suddenly called back to life by the promise and reassurance of your recovery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11360,3374-298032-0041,and only in that way does a human being become one and a complete entity that is by regarding and poetically conceiving himself as the centre of everything and the spirit of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11361,3374-298032-0042,but why poetically conceive since we find the germ of everything in ourselves and yet remain forever only a fragment of ourselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11362,1867-148436-0000,chapter twelve the first day mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11363,1867-148436-0001,and where the slopes pitched sharply down it wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot certainly the choice of nash was well made an eastern horse of blood over a level course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11364,1867-148436-0002,but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail dawn came while they wound over the crest of the range and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade it was well into the morning before nash reached logan,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11366,1867-148436-0004,bard who's he logan considered the other with a sardonic smile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11373,1867-148436-0011,he sounds like a tenderfoot but he ain't a tenderfoot feeling that this parting shot gave him the honours of the meeting he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs overhearing stood still and gazed at his master,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11374,1867-148436-0012,his eastern course nash pursued for a mile or more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11375,1867-148436-0013,he was weary like his horse and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed he let the pony go on at the same tireless jog clinging like a bulldog to the trail about midday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11396,1867-148436-0034,and the end was the rider lyin on the ground whenever the boys around here wanted any excitement they used to come over and try their hands with jo,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11403,1867-148436-0041,which maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performin because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle he was an he never pulled leather no sir he never touched the buckin strap but jest sat there with his teeth set,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11404,1867-148436-0042,and his lips twistin back the same smile he had when he got into the saddle but pretty soon i s'pose jo had a chance to figure out that it didn't do him no particular harm to be alone the minute he seen that he stopped fightin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11409,1867-154071-0001,found a big double room that ran across the whole length of the house from the back it looked down on the lights glimmering on the black east river and across to the flare of brooklyn to the left the whole arc of the fifty ninth street bridge was exposed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11411,1867-154071-0003,bill gregg shook his head that's not the one she's all different a pile different ronicky ronicky sighed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11413,1867-154071-0005,ghost hours of the early morning they did not relax their vigil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11414,1867-154071-0006,apparently the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality not a sign of caroline smith appeared even during the second day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11415,1867-154071-0007,by this time the nerves of the two watchers were shattered by the constant strain and the monotonous view from the front window was beginning to madden them it's proof that she ain't yonder said bill gregg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11416,1867-154071-0008,and he grew pale at the thought partner said ronicky doone if they are trying to keep her away from us they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days ain't that right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11417,1867-154071-0009,it's just about our last chance bill we've done our hunting pretty near as well as we could if we don't land her this trip i'm about ready to give up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11418,1867-154071-0010,one week was decided on as a fair test if at the end of that time caroline smith did not come out of the house across the street they could conclude that she did not stay there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11419,1867-154071-0011,peering through the slit between the drawn curtains which sheltered him from being observed at his spying when he called out softly the sound brought gregg with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window there could be no shadow of a doubt about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11420,1867-154071-0012,there stood caroline smith in the door of the house she closed the door behind her and walking to the top of the steps paused there and looked up and down the street bill gregg groaned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11421,1867-154071-0013,snatched his hat and plunged through the door and ronicky heard the brief thunder of his feet down the first flight of stairs then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11422,1867-154071-0014,and so swift was that descent that when the girl idling down the steps across the street came onto the sidewalk bill gregg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11423,1867-154071-0015,for never had the miner seemed so clumsily big and gaunt never had his clothes seemed so unpressed and shapeless while his soft gray hat to which he still clung religiously appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast with the slim prettiness of the girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11424,1867-154071-0016,she wore a black straw hat turned back from her face with a single big red flower at the side of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11425,1867-154071-0017,the same distinction between their clothes was in their faces the finely modeled prettiness of her features and the big careless chiseling of the features of bill gregg ronicky doone did not wonder that after her first fear her gesture was one of disdain and surprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11426,1867-154071-0018,he went a long slow step closer to her with both his hands outstretched,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11427,1867-154071-0019,ronicky doone followed that glance and he saw all hidden save the profile of the face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11428,1867-154071-0020,what a face it was never in his life had ronicky doone seen a man who in one instant filled him with such fear and hatred such loathing and such dread such scorn and such terror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11429,1867-154071-0021,the nose was hooked like the nose of a bird of prey the eyes were long and slanting like those of an oriental the face was thin almost fleshless so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a death's head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11430,1867-154071-0022,the girl hesitated a moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11431,1867-154071-0023,for she made a slight outward gesture with one hand if this were in her mind however it vanished instantly she turned with a shudder and hurried away down the street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11432,1867-154071-0024,as for bill gregg he bore himself straight as a soldier and came back across the pavement but it was the erectness of a soldier who has met with a crushing defeat and only preserves an outward resolution while all the spirit within is crushed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11433,1867-154071-0025,what a contrast between the ascent and the descent he had literally flown down now his heels clumped out a slow and regular death march as he came back to the room when gregg opened the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11434,1867-154071-0026,ronicky doone blinked and drew in a deep breath at the sight of the poor fellow's face gregg had known before that he truly loved this girl whom he had never seen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11435,1867-154071-0027,now in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood he had lost her and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11436,1867-154071-0028,after that he did not move so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply his legs were twisted awkwardly sprawling across the floor in front of him one long arm dragged down toward the floor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11437,1867-154071-0029,as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor hardened hands his chin was fallen against his breast when ronicky doone crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder he did not look up it's ended,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11438,1867-154071-0030,said bill gregg faintly now we hit the back trail and forget all about this he added with a faint attempt at cynicism i've just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine that's all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11439,1867-154071-0031,said ronicky doone bill look me in the eye and tell me man to man that you're a liar he added can you ever be happy without her man the cruelty of that speech made gregg flush,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11440,1867-154071-0032,said gregg huskily ain't there that's where you and me don't agree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11441,1867-154071-0033,look at the way things have gone you start out with a photograph of a girl now you've followed her found her name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11442,1867-154071-0034,ain't that something done after you've done all that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11443,1867-154071-0035,not you bill you're going to buck up and go ahead full steam,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11444,1867-154071-0036,bill gregg smiled sourly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11445,1867-154071-0037,d'you know what she said well bill gregg she says i don't remember any such name that took the wind out of me i only had enough left to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11446,1867-154071-0038,the gent that was writing those papers to the correspondence school to you from the west the one you sent your picture to and sent my picture to she says and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet you're mad she says,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11447,1867-154071-0039,and then she looks back over her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house d'you know why she looked back over her shoulder just for the reason i told you no bill there was a gent standing up there at a window watching her and how she acted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11453,1867-154075-0000,chapter twelve the strange bargain ronicky drew his gun and waited good said the man of the sneer go ahead it was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11454,1867-154075-0001,that dropped him into the coal bin did he get coal dust on his shoes right and he didn't have sense enough to wipe it off an amateur a rank amateur i told you said the man of the sneer with satisfaction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11455,1867-154075-0002,you followed his trail up the stairs to the kitchen and down the hall and up to harry's room we already knew he'd gone there but he left that room again and came down the hall yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11456,1867-154075-0003,and where did it lead right to this room ronicky stepped from among the smooth silks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11457,1867-154075-0004,the time had almost come for one desperate attempt to escape and he was ready to shoot to kill a moment of pause had come a pause which in the imagination of ronicky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11460,1867-154075-0007,the man growled some retort and left closing the door heavily behind him while ronicky doone breathed freely again for the first time now said the man of the sneer tell me the whole of it ruth ronicky set his teeth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11461,1867-154075-0008,had the clever devil guessed at the truth so easily had he sent his follower away merely to avoid having it known that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved go on the leader was repeating let me hear the whole truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11463,1867-154075-0010,you smiled so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here the only way he could get in was by stealth is that right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11464,1867-154075-0011,so he came in exactly that way like a robber but really only to keep a tryst with his lady love a pretty story a true romance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11465,1867-154075-0012,my dear girl john began ruth tolliver her voice shaking tush he broke in as smoothly as ever let me tell the story for you and spare your blushes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11466,1867-154075-0013,although you were glad to see him you warned him that it was dangerous to play with fire fire being me do i gather the drift of the story fairly well finally you have him worked up to the right pitch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11468,1867-154075-0015,yes said the girl unevenly that is ah murmured the man of the sneer you seem rather relieved that i have guessed he left the house in that case ronicky doone had held the latch of the door turned back for some time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11469,1867-154075-0016,now he pushed it open and stepped out he was only barely in time for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction since there was only one hiding place in the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11470,1867-154075-0017,he was brought up with a shock by the sight of ronicky's big colt held at the hip and covering him with absolute certainty ruth tolliver did not cry out but every muscle in her face and body seemed to contract,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11471,1867-154075-0018,as if she were preparing herself for the explosion you don't have to put up your hands said ronicky doone wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer he had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11474,1867-154075-0021,though i wasn't playing my hand at eavesdropping i couldn't help hearing you partner the man of the sneer looked him over leisurely western he said at last decidedly western are you staying long in the east my friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11476,1867-154075-0023,i suppose ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot about what a terrible fellow i am but i don't use poison and i don't kill with mysterious x rays i am as you see a very quiet and ordinary sort,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11477,1867-154075-0024,ronicky doone smiled again you just oblige me partner he replied in his own soft voice just stay away from the walls of the room don't even sit down stand right where you are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11478,1867-154075-0025,you'd murder me if i took another step asked the man of the sneer and a contemptuous and sardonic expression flitted across his face for the first time i'd sure blow you full of lead said ronicky fervently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11480,1867-154075-0027,i see that you have a most determined cavalier i suppose he'll instantly abduct you and sweep you away from beneath my eyes she made a vague gesture of denial go ahead said the leader by the way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11482,1867-154075-0029,you're wrong it was ah in spite of himself the face of john mark wrinkled with pain and suspicious rage i came to see a girl and her name i figure is caroline smith,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11483,1867-154075-0030,relief wonder and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the eyes of john mark caroline you came for that suddenly he laughed heartily but there was a tremor of emotion in that laughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11484,1867-154075-0031,the perfect torture which had been wringing the soul of the man of the sneer projected through the laughter i ask your pardon my dear said john mark to ruth i should have guessed you found him he confessed why he was here you took pity on him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11485,1867-154075-0032,and he brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and cool very well then it seems i've made an ass of myself but i'll try to make up for it now what about caroline,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11486,1867-154075-0033,leave this house and take a ride or a walk with me as much as that if you have to talk to her why not do the talking here i dunno replied ronicky doone i figure she'd think too much about you all the time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11493,1867-154075-0040,suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain said ronicky you send for caroline smith i'm to do the persuading to get her out of the house we're safe to the doors of the house the minute we step into the street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11494,1867-154075-0041,you're free to do anything you want to get either of us will you shake on that for a moment the leader hesitated then his fingers closed over the extended hand of ronicky doone and clamped down on them like so many steel wires contracting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11495,1867-154075-0042,at the same time a flush of excitement and fierceness passed over the face of john mark ronicky doone taken utterly by surprise was at a great disadvantage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11496,1867-154075-0043,a great rage came in the eyes of john mark a great wonder came in the eyes of the westerner where did john mark get his sudden strength well said ronicky we've shaken hands and now you can do what you please,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11498,1867-154075-0045,that brought a start from john mark and a flash of eagerness but he repressed the idea after a single glance at the girl we've shaken hands he admitted slowly as though just realizing the full extent of the meaning of that act,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11506,328-129766-0007,the port whither she was bound was to bristol where my brother's chief correspondent lived i got to london in about three weeks where i heard a little while after that the ship was arrived in bristol,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11507,328-129766-0008,the breaking of her mainmast she had great damage on board and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled i had now a new scene of life upon my hands and a dreadful appearance it had i was come away with a kind of final farewell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11508,328-129766-0009,what i brought with me was indeed considerable had it come safe and by the help of it i might have married again tolerably well but as it was i was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole and this without any hope of recruit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11509,328-129766-0010,i was entirely without friends nay even so much as without acquaintance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11510,328-129766-0011,that set me up formerly for a fortune she was dead and her husband also as i was informed upon sending a person unknown to inquire the looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to bristol and during my attendance upon that affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11511,328-129766-0012,i took the diversion of going to the bath for as i was still far from being old so my humour which was always gay continued so to an extreme and being now as it were a woman of fortune though i was a woman without a fortune,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11512,328-129766-0013,as had been my case before the bath is a place of gallantry enough expensive and full of snares i went thither indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11513,328-129766-0014,but i must do myself justice as to protest i knew nothing amiss i meant nothing but in an honest way nor had i any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards i suffered them to be guided,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11514,328-129766-0015,as it is called there and contracted some unhappy acquaintances which rather prompted the follies i fell afterwards into than fortified me against them i lived pleasantly enough kept good company that is to say gay fine company,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11515,328-129766-0016,but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly and that as i had no settled income so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death and this gave me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11516,328-129766-0017,however i shook them off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11517,328-129766-0018,but i was in the wrong place for it i was not now at redriff where if i had set myself tolerably up some honest sea captain or other might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony but i was at the bath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11518,328-129766-0019,where men find a mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a wife and consequently all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way i had spent the first season well enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11519,328-129766-0020,for though i had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the bath for his diversion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11520,328-129766-0021,as it might be called i had resisted some casual offers of gallantry and had managed that way well enough i was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it and i had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which i wanted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11521,328-129766-0022,i contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house i lodged who though she did not keep an ill house as we call it yet had none of the best principles in herself i had on all occasions behaved myself so well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11522,328-129766-0023,as not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever and all the men that i had conversed with were of so good reputation that i had not given the least reflection by conversing with them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11523,328-129766-0024,for a wicked correspondence if they had any of them offered it yet there was one gentleman as above who always singled me out for the diversion of my company as he called it which as he was pleased to say was very agreeable to him but at that time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11524,328-129766-0025,there was no more in it i had many melancholy hours at the bath after the company was gone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11525,328-129766-0026,and for recruits of money yet i chose to come back to bath for my residence because being on good terms with the woman in whose house i lodged in the summer i found that during the winter i lived rather cheaper there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11526,328-129766-0027,here i say i passed the winter as heavily as i had passed the autumn cheerfully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11527,328-129766-0028,of what lay hardest upon my mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea i told her also that i had a mother and a brother in virginia in good circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11528,328-129766-0029,and as i had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition and the great loss i had received,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11529,328-129766-0030,so i did not fail to let my new friend know that i expected a supply from thence and so indeed i did and as the ships went from bristol to york river in virginia and back again generally in less time from london,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11530,328-129766-0031,and that my brother corresponded chiefly at bristol i thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to london where also i had not the least acquaintance my new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11531,328-129766-0032,and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for lodging during the winter i paid nothing at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11532,328-129766-0033,till it was found necessary to do otherwise she had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house and in particular the gentleman who as i said singled me out for his companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11533,328-129766-0034,the winter before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11534,328-129766-0035,letting him know that i was still with her but she denied it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same in a word this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11535,328-129766-0036,if i might believe him was to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11536,328-129766-0037,and he had such an opinion of my virtue that as he often professed he believed if he should offer anything else i should reject him with contempt he soon understood from me that i was a widow that i had arrived at bristol from virginia by the last ships,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11537,328-129766-0038,and that i waited at bath till the next virginia fleet should arrive by which i expected considerable effects i understood by him and by others of him that he had a wife but that the lady was distempered in her head and was under the conduct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11538,328-129766-0039,of her own relations which he consented to to avoid any reflections that might as was not unusual in such cases be cast on him for mismanaging her cure and in the meantime he came to the bath to divert his thoughts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11539,328-129766-0040,from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was my landlady who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions gave me an advantageous character of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11540,328-129766-0041,as a man of honour and of virtue as well as of great estate and indeed i had a great deal of reason to say so of him too for though we lodged both on a floor and he had frequently come into my chamber even when i was in bed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11541,328-129766-0042,and i also into his when he was in bed yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss or so much as solicited me to anything till long after as you shall hear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11542,328-129766-0043,and she again used to tell me she believed it was so from the beginning however she used to tell me that she thought i ought to expect some gratification from him for my company for indeed he did as it were engross me and i was seldom from him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11543,328-129766-0044,i told her i had not given him the least occasion to think i wanted it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11544,328-129766-0045,and she did so and managed it so dexterously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11545,328-129766-0046,and so i put off all room for any offer for the present however it was not long before he attacked me again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11546,328-129766-0047,which he was sorry for assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity but merely to assist me if there was any occasion but since i,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11547,328-129766-0048,in need of any assistance he had but one thing more to desire of me and that was that i would promise him that when i was any way straitened or like to be so i would frankly tell him of it and that i would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11548,328-129766-0049,adding that i should always find i had a true friend though perhaps i was afraid to trust him i omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged to let him know that i had a due sense of his kindness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11549,328-129766-0050,and indeed from that time i did not appear so much reserved to him as i had done before though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides but how free soever our conversation was i could not arrive to that sort of freedom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11550,328-129766-0051,though i was secretly very glad of his offer some weeks passed after this and still i never asked him for money when my landlady a cunning creature who had often pressed me to it but found that i could not do it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11551,328-129766-0052,makes a story of her own inventing and comes in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11552,328-129766-0053,oh widow says she i have bad news to tell you this morning what is that said i are the virginia ships taken by the french for that was my fear no no says she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11553,328-129766-0054,but the man you sent to bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he has brought none now i could by no means like her project,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11554,328-129766-0055,which indeed he did not want and i clearly saw that i should lose nothing by being backward to ask so i took her up short,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11555,328-129766-0056,said i for i assure you he brought me all the money i sent him for and here it is said i pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it and added i intend you shall have most of it by and by he seemed distasted a little at her talking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11556,328-129766-0057,as she did at first as well as i taking it as i fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself again the next morning we talked of it again when i found he was fully satisfied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11557,328-129766-0058,and smiling said he hoped i would not want money and not tell him of it and that i had promised him otherwise i told him i had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady's talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11558,328-129766-0059,but i supposed she wanted what i owed her which was about eight guineas which i had resolved to give her and had accordingly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11559,328-129766-0060,he was in a might good humour when he heard me say i had paid her and it went off into some other discourse at that time but the next morning he having heard me up about my room before him he called to me and i answering he asked me to come into his chamber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11560,328-129766-0061,for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment after some very kind expressions he asked me if i would be very honest to him and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11561,328-129766-0062,at the word sincere and asking him if i had ever given him any answers which were not sincere i promised him i would why then his request was he said to let him see my purse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11562,328-129766-0063,i immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing to him pulled it out and there was in it three guineas and a half,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11563,328-129766-0064,not by a great deal well then he said he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the money i had every farthing i told him i would and i went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11564,328-129766-0065,where i had about six guineas more and some silver and threw it all down upon the bed and told him there was all my wealth honestly to a shilling he looked a little at it but did not tell it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11565,328-129766-0066,and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key and bade me open a little walnut tree box he had upon the table and bring him such a drawer which i did in which drawer there was a great deal of money in gold i believe near two hundred guineas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11567,328-129766-0068,when i had done so he made me put them into my lap and took my little drawer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11568,328-129766-0069,and carry it all home into my own chamber i relate this story the more particularly because of the good humour there was in it and to show the temper with which we conversed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11569,328-129766-0070,and in a word pressed me to buy better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11570,328-129766-0071,for i loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes i told him i must housewife the money he had lent me or else i should not be able to pay him again he then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me and knew my circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11571,328-129766-0072,and that he thought i had merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as i had done after this he made me take a maid and keep house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11572,328-129766-0073,which i did very willingly believing as it appeared that i should lose nothing by it nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too we had lived thus near three months when,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11574,328-129766-0075,i was not very easy in that proposal not knowing what posture i was to live in there or how he might use me but while this was in debate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11575,328-129766-0076,called shepton where he had some business and was there taken very ill and so ill that he could not travel so he sent his man back to bath to beg me that i would hire a coach and come over to him before he went,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11576,328-129766-0077,he had left all his money and other things of value with me and what to do with them i did not know but i secured them as well as i could and locked up the lodgings and went to him where i found him very ill indeed however i persuaded him to be carried,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11577,328-129766-0078,in a litter to the bath where there was more help and better advice to be had he consented and i brought him to the bath which was about fifteen miles as i remember here he continued very ill of a fever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

11579,328-129766-0080,indeed if i had been his wife i could not have done more i sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer and then i got a pallet bed into his room and lay in it just at his bed's feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11580,328-129766-0081,i was indeed sensibly affected with his condition and with the apprehension of losing such a friend as he was and was like to be to me and i used to sit and cry by him many hours together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11581,328-129766-0082,however at last he grew better and gave hopes that he would recover as indeed he did though very slowly were it otherwise than what i am going to say i should not be backward to disclose it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11582,328-129766-0083,as it is apparent i have done in other cases in this account but i affirm that through all this conversation abating the freedom of coming into the chamber when i or he was in bed and abating the necessary offices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11583,328-129766-0084,of attending him night and day when he was sick there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us oh that it had been so to the last after some time he gathered strength and grew well apace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11584,328-129766-0085,and i would have removed my pallet bed but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him and then i removed to my own chamber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11585,328-129766-0086,and when he grew quite well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care and as he called it for hazarding my life to save his and now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11586,328-129766-0087,but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own i told him i was fully satisfied of it he carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in bed with me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11587,328-129766-0088,as he would defend it if i was assaulted by a ravisher i believed him and told him i did so but this did not satisfy him he would he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11588,328-129766-0089,was a great while after this that i had occasion on my own business to go to bristol upon which he hired me a coach and would go with me and did so and now indeed our intimacy increased,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11589,328-129766-0090,to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11590,328-129766-0091,and coming into that room said very frankly to him sir it is none of my business to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11591,328-129766-0092,which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds well says my friend very readily these beds will do and as for the rest we are too near akin to lie together though we may lodge near one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11592,328-129766-0093,he decently went out of the room till i was in bed and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room but lay there talking to me a great while at last repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me and not offer me the least injury,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11593,328-129766-0094,he starts out of his bed and now my dear says he you shall see how just i will be to you and that i can keep my word and away he comes to my bed i resisted a little but i must confess i should not have resisted him much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11594,328-129766-0095,if he had not made those promises at all so after a little struggle as i said i lay still and let him come to bed when he was there he took me in his arms and so i lay all night with him but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11595,328-129766-0096,other than embracing me as i say in his arms no not the whole night but rose up and dressed him in the morning and left me as innocent for him as i was the day i was born this was a surprising thing to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
11596,328-129766-0097,and perhaps may be so to others who know how the laws of nature work for he was a strong vigorous brisk person nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all but of mere affection insisting on it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

42,8468-294887-0042,they were remarkably fine young men and it seemed a special providence that i should find them in such a large city and direct them to escape from their pursuer within one hour after i left my house in brooklyn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
43,8468-295198-0000,and this was the case with mother magpie she was always full of everybody's business but her own up and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest knowing everyone's affairs telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
44,8468-295198-0001,and ready to cast her advice gratis at every bird and beast of the woods now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the oak tree to tell old parson too whit what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
45,8468-295198-0002,then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman who was always sleepy of a monday morning mother magpie would take a peep into missus oriole's nest sit chattering on a bough above and pour forth floods of advice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

47,8468-295198-0004,now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you it's all on account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner but my dear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
48,8468-295198-0005,piped missus oriole timidly the orioles always have built in this manner and it suits our constitution a fiddle on your constitution how can you tell what agrees with your constitution unless you try you own you are not well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
49,8468-295198-0006,you are subject to headaches and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain ask old doctor kite i was talking with him about your case only yesterday and says he missus magpie i perfectly agree with you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
50,8468-295198-0007,but my husband prefers this style of building that's only because he isn't properly instructed pray did you ever attend doctor kite's lectures on the nervous system no i have no time to attend lectures who would sit on the eggs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
51,8468-295198-0008,o missus magpie pray don't speak to my husband he will think i've been complaining no no he won't let me alone i understand just how to say the thing i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave offence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
52,8468-295198-0009,i say my dear if you will persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie my dear i don't gossip she comes and bores me to death with talking and then goes off and mistakes what she has been saying for what i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
53,8468-295198-0010,but you must cut her i try to all i can but she won't be cut it's enough to make a bird swear said tommy oriole tommy oriole to say the truth had as good a heart as ever beat under bird's feathers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
54,8468-295198-0011,but then he had a weakness for concerts and general society because he was held to be by all odds the handsomest bird in the woods and sung like an angel and so the truth was he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom titmouse or billy wren,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
55,8468-295198-0012,the fact is quoth tommy i am a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace and my wife must learn to accommodate if she has a brilliant husband,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
56,8468-295198-0013,whose success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position she must pay something for it i'm sure billy wren's wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home to say the truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
57,8468-295198-0014,my wife was all well enough content till old mother magpie interfered it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
58,8468-295198-0015,and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses if a meddlesome magpie gets her claw into their nest but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter she bustled off down to water dock lane where as we said in a former narrative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

60,8468-295198-0017,latterly some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age in fact since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
61,8468-295198-0018,which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts they pulled the young checkerberry before it even had time to blossom rooted up the sassafras shrubs and gnawed their roots fired off guns at the birds and on several occasions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
62,8468-295198-0019,when old doctor bullfrog was leading a concert had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones this was not the worst of it the little varlets had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
63,8468-295198-0020,that old bullfrog was a bore and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
64,8468-295198-0021,poor old doctor bullfrog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him one morning well neighbour how unreasonable people are who would have thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
65,8468-295198-0022,madam said doctor bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable i don't believe it i can't believe it you must have made a mistake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

69,8468-295198-0026,adapt it to modern times everybody now is a little touched with the operatic fever and there's tommy oriole has been to new orleans and brought back a touch of the artistic if you would try his style a little something tyrolean you see,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

71,8468-295198-0028,i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing suppose tommy oriole should sit half his days up to his hips in water as you do his voice would be as hoarse and rough as yours come up on the bank and learn to perch as we birds do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
72,8468-295198-0029,we are the true musical race and so poor mister bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cat tails where his green spectacles and honest round back had excited even in the minds of the boys sentiments of respect and compassion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
73,8468-295198-0030,he came up into the garden and established himself under a burdock and began to practise italian scales the result was that poor old doctor bullfrog instead of being considered as a respectable old bore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
74,8468-295198-0031,got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners every bird and beast in the forest had a gibe at him and even old parson too whit thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
75,8468-295198-0032,and admonish him about courses unbefitting his age and standing as to mother magpie you may be sure that she assured every one how sorry she was that dear old doctor bullfrog had made such a fool of himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
76,8468-295198-0033,but the tragedy for the poor old music teacher grew even more melancholy in its termination for one day as he was sitting disconsolately under a currant bush in the garden practising his poor old notes in a quiet way thump,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
77,8468-286673-0000,the slow little mud turtle when the twenty little mud turtles broke their egg shells one hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
78,8468-286673-0001,the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank near by said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
79,8468-286673-0002,and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters i'm coming in a minute the other little turtles waited but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
80,8468-286673-0003,and talked a while with him come on said the biggest little turtle don't let's wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
81,8468-286673-0004,and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to quite as though he were out of patience about something why didn't you turtles wait for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
82,8468-286673-0005,you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
83,8468-286673-0006,the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well the mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neck skin she was so eager to see them all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
84,8468-286673-0007,why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle who was trying to make a place for himself on the log they didn't wait for me he said i was coming right along but they wouldn't wait i think they are just as mea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
85,8468-286673-0008,the mother turtle raised one of her forefeet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
86,8468-286673-0009,i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
87,8468-286673-0010,yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
88,8468-286673-0011,the first year i had only a few children the next year i had more and so it has gone every year a few more children than the year before until now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always one slow little turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
89,8468-286673-0012,who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him that makes him miss his share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody else's fault the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
90,8468-286673-0013,and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell side walls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
91,8468-286673-0014,i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sad very very sad,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
92,8468-286673-0015,and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not have him with us long,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
93,8468-286673-0016,i remember so well my first slow child and how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her forefeet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
94,8468-286673-0017,the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
95,8468-286673-0018,or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
96,8468-286673-0019,and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher back shells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
97,8468-286673-0020,and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
98,8468-286673-0021,their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their rounded up back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
99,8468-286673-0022,she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their webbed feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
100,8468-286673-0023,yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
101,8468-286673-0024,she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw two terrible great two legged animals wading into the pond from the shore boys she cried boys and she sprawled off the end of her log,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
102,8468-286673-0025,and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
103,8468-286673-0026,then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and rapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
104,8468-286673-0027,next the other great animal took him and turned him over and rapped on his shells and stared at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
105,8468-286673-0028,he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
106,8468-286673-0029,he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
107,8468-286673-0030,this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
108,8468-286673-0031,then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
109,8468-286673-0032,i wish i might help you some time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
110,8468-286673-0033,i'm here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you i'm not hungry he murmured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
111,8468-286673-0034,and again he fell fast asleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
112,8468-286673-0035,but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
113,8468-286673-0036,does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i am so glad to get back i'll never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
114,8468-286673-0037,if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
115,8468-286673-0038,he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
116,8468-286673-0039,he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
117,8468-286673-0040,and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
118,445-123860-0000,tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd when not to be receives reproach of being and the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd not by our feeling but by others seeing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
119,445-123860-0001,for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood or on my frailties why are frailer spies which in their wills count bad what i think good,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

211,6000-55211-0007,and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought best to try to get over to the house maybe aunt hannah would come too for luncheon would she i'm afraid not returned billy with a rueful laugh she's got three shawls on this morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
212,6000-55211-0008,i'll tell her though and i'll see you at eleven finished billy as she hung up the receiver promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william at park street and together they set out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
213,6000-55211-0009,but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown i declare billy i'm not sure but we'd better turn back he fretted i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this billy shivered a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
214,6000-55211-0010,nonsense uncle william of course you won't turn back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
215,6000-55211-0011,she finished just above her breath missus greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs up which william henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
216,6000-55211-0012,billy really i think we should turn back but billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes she was missus greggory yes she was even as she uttered the words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
217,6000-55211-0013,however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion missus greggory was a cripple her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
218,6000-55211-0014,both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
219,6000-55211-0015,mechanically she had taken the chair toward which missus greggory had motioned her she had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
220,6000-55211-0016,missus greggory had seated herself now and william henshaw had cleared his throat nervously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
221,6000-55211-0017,we er i came from harlow missus greggory he gave me to understand you had an er teapot that er with his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table william henshaw came to a helpless pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
222,6000-55211-0018,a curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed missus greggory's face terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy relief in the end conquered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
223,6000-55211-0019,though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke the lowestoft yes i'm so glad that is of course i must be glad i'll get it her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
224,6000-55211-0020,there was only despairing sorrow on her face now the man rose at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
225,6000-55211-0021,what a beauty missus greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy in tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
226,6000-55211-0022,near it set a tray like plate of the same ware and decoration if you'll lift it down please yourself motioned missus greggory i don't like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
227,6000-55211-0023,with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot his eyes sparkled billy look what a beauty and it's a lowestoft too the real thing the genuine true soft paste,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
228,6000-55211-0024,and there's the tray did you notice he exulted turning back to the shelf you don't see that every day they get separated most generally you know these pieces have been in our family for generations said missus greggory with an accent of pride,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
229,6000-55211-0025,you'll find them quite perfect i think perfect i should say they were cried the man they are then valuable missus greggory's voice shook indeed they are but you must know that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
230,6000-55211-0026,i have been told so yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association my mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir again her voice broke william henshaw cleared his throat but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
231,6000-55211-0027,madam if you do not wish to sell he stopped abruptly his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china missus greggory gave a low cry but i do that is i must,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
232,6000-55211-0028,and that it will bring in money and we need money she threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks i can't do much at work that pays i sew she nodded toward the machine by the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
233,6000-55211-0029,but with only one foot to make it go you see the other is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
234,6000-55211-0030,she finished with a wistful whimsicality billy turned away sharply there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
235,6000-55211-0031,or against uncle william for wanting the teapot or for not wanting it if he did not buy it and so you see i do very much wish to sell missus greggory said then perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
236,6000-55211-0032,the collector's eyes glowed he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it then he turned to the tray after a moment he spoke i have only one other in my collection as rare he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
237,6000-55211-0033,i paid a hundred dollars for that i shall be glad to give you the same for this madam missus greggory started visibly a hundred dollars so much as that she cried almost joyously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
238,6000-55211-0034,brought of course if it's worth that to you she paused suddenly a quick step had sounded in the hall outside the next moment the door flew open,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
239,6000-55211-0035,mother only think i've she stopped and drew back a little her startled eyes went from one face to another then dropped to the lowestoft teapot in the man's hands her expression changed at once she shut the door quickly and hurried forward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
240,6000-55211-0036,mother what is it who are these people she asked sharply billy lifted her chin the least bit she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
241,6000-55211-0037,william henshaw too raised his chin he also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people my name is henshaw miss greggory i presume he said quietly i was sent here by mister harlow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
242,6000-55211-0038,stammered missus greggory wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it er my daughter alice mister henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and miss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
243,6000-55211-0039,neilson supplied the man as she looked at billy and hesitated a swift red stained alice greggory's face with barely an acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother yes dear but that won't be necessary now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
244,6000-55211-0040,as i started to tell you when i came in i have two new pupils and so turning to the man again i thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
245,6000-55211-0041,william henshaw frowned angrily that was the man but his eyes the collector's eyes sought the teapot longingly before either the man or the collector could speak however missus greggory interposed quick words of remonstrance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
246,6000-55211-0042,but alice my dear she almost sobbed you didn't wait to let me tell you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
247,6000-55211-0043,he will give us a hundred dollars a hundred dollars echoed the girl faintly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
248,6000-55211-0044,billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
249,6000-55211-0045,billy was wondering which she herself desired more that uncle william should buy the lowestoft or that he should not she knew she wished missus greggory to have the hundred dollars there was no doubt on that point then uncle william spoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
250,6000-55211-0046,and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp i am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly i certainly should not have made it had i not had missus greggory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
251,6000-55211-0047,alice greggory turned as if stung wished to sell she repeated the words with superb disdain she was plainly very angry her blue gray eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
252,6000-55211-0048,do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing alice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
253,6000-55211-0049,i can't help it stormed the girl hotly i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
254,6000-55211-0050,perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darned and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes alice gasped missus greggory in dismayed horror,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
255,6000-55211-0051,with a little outward fling of her two hands alice greggory stepped back her face had grown white again i beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet i should not have spoken so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
256,6000-55211-0052,you are very kind mister henshaw but i do not think we care to sell the lowestoft to day both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh william henshaw picked up his hat his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
257,6000-55211-0053,or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something during the brief minute that he hesitated however billy sprang forward missus greggory please won't you let me buy the teapot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
258,6000-55211-0054,and then won't you keep it for me here i haven't the hundred dollars with me but i'll send it right away you will let me do it won't you it was an impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
259,6000-55211-0055,but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy missus greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking dear child she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
260,6000-55211-0056,even while she shook her head in denial not so her daughter alice greggory flushed scarlet she drew herself proudly erect thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
261,6000-55211-0057,we prefer them infinitely to charity oh but please i didn't mean you didn't understand faltered billy for answer alice greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it open oh alice my dear pleaded missus greggory again feebly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
262,6000-55211-0058,come billy we'll bid you good morning ladies said william henshaw then decisively and billy with a little wistful pat on missus greggory's clasped hands went once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
263,6000-55211-0059,william henshaw drew a long breath well by jove billy the next time i take you curio hunting it won't be to this place he fumed wasn't it awful choked billy awful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
264,6000-55211-0060,the girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss i ever saw i didn't want her old lowestoft if she didn't want to sell it but to practically invite me there and then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
265,6000-55211-0061,still i was sorry for the poor little old lady i wish somehow she could have that hundred dollars it was the man who said this not the collector so do i rejoined billy dolefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
266,831-130746-0000,the ostler being a fool rushed violently down the road vociferating after them then he returned panting to the vicuna hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up stopped to give them the cream of the adventure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
267,831-130746-0001,that gave the fugitives five minutes then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the barmaid what the matter was and the gov'nor being out they spent some more precious time wondering what ever was to be done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
268,831-130746-0002,there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse that made ten minutes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
269,831-130746-0003,then stephen the waiter who had shown hoopdriver up came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question which that turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour and in the midst of this discussion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

271,831-130746-0005,incredulous eyes stared into one another's in the bar as his paces muffled by the stair carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

273,831-130746-0007,they listened together his feet stopped turned went out of the diningroom down the passage to the bedroom stopped again poor chap said the barmaid she's a wicked woman sssh said stephen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
274,831-130746-0008,after a pause bechamel went back to the dining room they heard a chair creak under him interlude of conversational eyebrows i'm going up said stephen to break the melancholy news to him bechamel looked up from a week old newspaper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
275,831-130746-0009,as without knocking stephen entered bechamel's face suggested a different expectation beg pardon sir said stephen with a diplomatic cough well said bechamel wondering suddenly if jessie had kept some of her threats,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

277,831-130746-0011,he rose with a fine surprise gone he said with a half laugh gone sir on her bicycle on her bicycle why she went sir with another gentleman this time bechamel was really startled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
278,831-130746-0012,an other gentlemen who another gentleman in brown sir went into the yard sir got out the two bicycles sir and went off sir about twenty minutes ago bechamel stood with his eyes round and his knuckle on his hips,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
279,831-130746-0013,but as yet he seemed merely stunned brown clothes he said and fairish a little like yourself sir in the dark the ostler sir jim duke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
280,831-130746-0014,then with infinite fervour he said but let us put in blank cartridge he said i might have thought he flung himself into the armchair damn her said bechamel for all the world like a common man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
281,831-130746-0015,i'll chuck this infernal business they've gone eigh yessir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
282,831-130746-0016,making a memorable saying let em go who cares and i wish him luck and bring me some bourbon as fast as you can there's a good chap,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
283,831-130746-0017,stephen was too surprised to say anything but bourbon sir go on said bechamel damn you stephen's sympathies changed at once yessir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marvelling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
284,831-130746-0018,she had evidently gone off with him and that little business was over and he was here stranded and sold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
285,831-130746-0019,and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all that the girl had escaped through her stepmother in which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
286,831-130746-0020,knickerbockers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
287,831-130746-0021,he banged the arms of the chair with his fist and swore again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
288,831-130746-0022,i bechamel when with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door stephen entered with the bourbon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
289,831-130746-0023,the moonlight ride and so the twenty minutes law passed into an infinity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
290,831-130746-0024,the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vicuna hotel we leave all bognor as we have left all chichester,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
291,831-130746-0025,and midhurst and haslemere and guildford and ripley and putney and follow this dear fool of a hoopdriver of ours and his young lady in grey out upon the moonlight road how they rode,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
292,831-130746-0026,how their hearts beat together and their breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursuit for all that flight mister hoopdriver was in the world of romance had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
293,831-130746-0027,hoopdriver had cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born had bechamel arisen in the way with rapiers for a duel hoopdriver had fought as one to whom agincourt was a reality and drapery a dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
294,831-130746-0028,it was rescue elopement glory and she by the side of him he had seen her face in shadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
295,831-130746-0029,he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears but what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon the road turned northward going round through the outskirts of bognor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
296,831-130746-0030,then amidst villas again some warm and lamplit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw broad wan meadows shrouded in a low lying mist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
297,831-130746-0031,they scarcely heeded whither they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewy night pale and intricate and high,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
298,831-130746-0032,at a footfall at a roughness in the road she seemed to be too intent upon escape to give much thought to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
299,831-130746-0033,his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position the night was a warm white silence save for the subtile running of their chains,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
300,831-130746-0034,he looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankles gracefully ruling the treadles now the road turned westward and she was a dark grey outline against the shimmer of the moon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
301,831-130746-0035,and now they faced northwards and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and cheek there is a magic quality in moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
302,831-130746-0036,it has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy route,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
303,831-130746-0037,white dust hot underfoot blinding to the eye is now a soft grey silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
304,831-130746-0038,she who has spiritualised the world alone save for two attendant steady shining stars and in silence under her benign influence under the benediction of her light rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
305,831-130746-0039,nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mister hoopdriver's skull at the turnings of the road he made his decisions with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard the right he would say or again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
306,831-130746-0040,the left as one who knew so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
307,831-130746-0041,hullo said mister hoopdriver sotto voce they dismounted abruptly stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
308,831-130746-0042,you are safe said mister hoopdriver sweeping off his cap with an air and bowing courtly where are we safe but where chichester harbour he waved his arm seaward as though it was a goal do you think they will follow us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
309,831-130746-0043,we have turned and turned again it seemed to hoopdriver that he heard her sob she stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

316,831-130746-0050,you would make me your brother miss beaumont yes we could stop there together she took a minute to answer i am going to light these lamps said hoopdriver he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
317,831-130746-0051,grave and intent how could she ever have thought him common or absurd but you must tell me your name brother she said er carrington said mister hoopdriver after a momentary pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

319,831-130746-0053,the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely she had to speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
320,831-130746-0054,she said with a laugh to break the intensity he opened his mouth and shut it again and with a sudden wincing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine she looked down at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
321,831-130746-0055,almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes it was as i have indicated the hour and season of the full moon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
322,831-130746-0056,and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converge thereupon that chichester was at last attained it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

333,831-130739-0006,under which happier circumstances you might if of an observing turn of mind and not too much of a housewife to be inhuman have given the central figure of this story less cursory attention,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
334,831-130739-0007,now if you had noticed anything about him it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable he wore the black morning coat the black tie and the speckled grey nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
335,831-130739-0008,hair of a kind of dirty fairness greyish eyes and a skimpy immature moustache under his peaked indeterminate nose his features were all small but none ill shaped a rosette of pins decorated the lappel of his coat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

339,831-130739-0012,sayn then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

341,831-130739-0014,one glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilities at work all about you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
342,831-130739-0015,but real literature as distinguished from anecdote does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone literature is revelation modern literature is indecorous revelation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
343,831-130739-0016,it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen even at the cost of some blushes and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
344,831-130739-0017,the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was let us face it bravely the remarkable condition of this young man's legs let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
345,831-130739-0018,let us assume something of the scientific spirit the hard almost professorial tone of the conscientious realist let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest with the unemotional,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
346,831-130739-0019,and so to our revelation on the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed ladies and gentlemen a contusion and an abrasion on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contusion also,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
347,831-130739-0020,on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise on his left shin there were two bruises one a leaden yellow graduating here and there into purple and another obviously of more recent date of a blotchy red,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
348,831-130739-0021,tumid and threatening proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner an unnatural hardness and redness would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
349,831-130739-0022,and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
350,831-130739-0023,the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee so far we may proceed with our details,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
351,831-130739-0024,fired by these discoveries an investigator might perhaps have pursued his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders elbows and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
352,831-130739-0025,he had indeed been bumped and battered at an extraordinary number of points but enough of realistic description is as good as a feast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
353,831-130739-0026,even in literature one must know where to draw the line now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shopman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
354,831-130739-0027,one might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a threshing machine say or one of those hay making furies but sherlock holmes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
355,831-130739-0028,would have fancied nothing of the kind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
356,831-130739-0029,considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner upon the bicycling saddle and that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
357,831-130739-0030,of the concussions attendant on that person's hasty frequently causeless and invariably ill conceived descents one large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
358,831-130739-0031,for upon every one of them waits the jest of the unexpected treadle you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and whack you are rubbing your shin so out of innocence we ripen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
359,831-130739-0032,two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in learning such as one might expect in a person unused to muscular exercise blisters on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering rider and so forth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
360,831-130739-0033,until sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old fashioned affair with a fork instead of the diamond frame a cushioned tire well worn on the hind wheel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
361,831-130739-0034,rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from roehampton to putney hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
362,831-130739-0035,a gasping and grunting a shouting of steer man steer a wavering unsteady flight a spasmodic turning of the missile edifice of man and machine and a collapse then you descry dimly through the dusk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
363,831-130739-0036,thus even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself and drive him against all the conditions of his calling against the counsels of prudence and the restrictions of his means,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
364,831-130739-0037,to seek the wholesome delights of exertion and danger and pain and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man to which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
365,831-130739-0038,but enough of these revelations the central figure of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be packed by the senior porter and sent to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
366,831-130739-0039,and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins to straighten them punctiliously near him is an apprentice apprenticed to the same high calling of draper's assistant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
367,831-130739-0040,a ruddy red haired lad in a very short tailless black coat and a very high collar who is deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of cretonne,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
368,831-130739-0041,the assistant is dreaming of the delicious time only four hours off now when he will resume the tale of his bruises and abrasions the apprentice is nearer the long long thoughts of boyhood and his imagination rides cap a pie,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

370,831-130739-0043,he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

373,831-130739-0046,how about this day week hoopdriver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the corners of the gingham folds in his hands his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations can he learn it in a week that's the question,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
374,831-130739-0047,otherwise briggs will get next week and he will have to wait until september when the weather is often uncertain he is naturally of a sanguine disposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
375,831-130739-0048,all drapers have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you the decision comes at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
376,831-130739-0049,the next in the strict scale of precedence of the drapery emporium mister hoopdriver in alternating spasms anon straightens his gingham and anon becomes meditative with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom tooth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

379,831-130739-0052,said hoopdriver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient moustache,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
380,831-130739-0053,you stow it said mister hoopdriver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
381,831-130739-0054,i'm getting fairly safe upon it now he told miss howe at other times hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

425,1963-142393-0000,adam understood dinah's haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
426,1963-142393-0001,i wish i'd asked her to write to me though he thought and yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
427,1963-142393-0002,she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while and i've no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes she's told me what her mind is and she's not a woman to say one thing and mean another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
428,1963-142393-0003,i'll wait patiently that was adam's wise resolution and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
429,1963-142393-0004,but towards the middle of october the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion the weeks were unusually long dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
430,1963-142393-0005,he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second he treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
431,1963-142393-0006,but that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us adam was no longer so confident as he had been he began to fear that perhaps dinah's old life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
432,1963-142393-0007,would have too strong a grasp upon her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
433,1963-142393-0008,if she had not felt this she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him as adam's confidence waned his patience waned with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
434,1963-142393-0009,and he thought he must write himself he must ask dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful he sat up late one night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
435,1963-142393-0010,it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips for her presence reconciled him to her will you perceive how it was adam was hungering for the sight of dinah,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
436,1963-142393-0011,and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn but what harm could he do by going to snowfield dinah could not be displeased with him for it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
437,1963-142393-0012,she had not forbidden him to go she must surely expect that he would go before long by the second sunday in october,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
438,1963-142393-0013,that he was already on his way to snowfield on horseback this time for his hours were precious now and he had borrowed jonathan burge's good nag for the journey what keen memories went along the road with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
439,1963-142393-0014,he had often been to oakbourne and back since that first journey to snowfield but beyond oakbourne the greystone walls the broken country the meagre trees seemed to be telling him afresh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
440,1963-142393-0015,the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time or rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters and adam,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
441,1963-142393-0016,this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey country thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past that is a base,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
442,1963-142393-0017,and selfish even a blasphemous spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
443,1963-142393-0018,adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank god for another's misery and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy in adam's behalf,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
444,1963-142393-0019,i should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said evil's evil and sorrow's sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
445,1963-142393-0020,by wrapping it up in other words other folks were not created for my sake that i should think all square when things turn out well for me but it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
446,1963-142393-0021,which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
447,1963-142393-0022,by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day the growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
448,1963-142393-0023,we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or a philosopher to his less complete formula,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
449,1963-142393-0024,something like this sense of enlarged being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
450,1963-142393-0025,the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him tender and deep as his love for hetty had been,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
451,1963-142393-0026,so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away his love for dinah was better and more precious to him for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
452,1963-142393-0027,it's like as if it was a new strength to me he said to himself to love her and know as she loves me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

454,1963-142393-0029,as if you could walk more fearless when you've more trust in another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
455,1963-142393-0030,i've always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
456,1963-142393-0031,when you can't look to them nearest to you t help you with a bit better thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
457,1963-142393-0032,when adam came in sight of the grey town on the hill side and looked searchingly towards the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill the scene looked less harsh in the soft,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
458,1963-142393-0033,october sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
459,1963-142393-0034,that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky had a milder more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day adam's doubts and fears melted under this influence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
460,1963-142393-0035,as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him he seemed to see dinah's gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
461,1963-142393-0036,he did not expect dinah to be at home at this hour but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
462,1963-142393-0037,he had set his mind on following her and bringing her home she was gone to sloman's end a hamlet about three miles off over the hill the old woman told him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
463,1963-142393-0038,to preach in a cottage there as her habit was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
464,1963-142393-0039,so adam got on his horse again and rode to the town putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord from whose friendly questions and reminiscences,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
465,1963-142393-0040,he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards sloman's end with all his haste it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
466,1963-142393-0041,the little grey desolate looking hamlet unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
467,1963-142393-0042,perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away adam thought i'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
468,1963-142393-0043,and seated himself on a loose stone against the low wall to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill he chose this spot almost at the top of the hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
469,1963-142393-0044,because it was away from all eyes no house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep near no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
470,1963-142393-0045,she was much longer coming than he expected he waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer at last he saw the little black figure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
471,1963-142393-0046,coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill slowly adam thought but dinah was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
472,1963-142393-0047,now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill but adam would not move yet he would not meet her too soon he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness and now he began to fear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
473,1963-142393-0048,lest he should startle her too much yet he thought she's not one to be overstartled she's always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
474,1963-142393-0049,perhaps she had found complete repose without him and had ceased to feel any need of his love on the verge of a decision we all tremble hope pauses with fluttering wings but now at last she was very near,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
475,1963-142393-0050,and adam rose from the stone wall it happened that just as he walked forward dinah had paused and turned round to look back at the village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
476,1963-142393-0051,adam was glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him he came within three paces of her and then said dinah,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
477,1963-142393-0052,she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place dinah adam said again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
478,1963-142393-0053,what was in her mind she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice but this second time she looked round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
479,1963-142393-0054,what a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark eyed man she did not start again at the sight of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
480,1963-142393-0055,and they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell adam was content and said nothing it was dinah who spoke first adam she said it is the divine will,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
481,1963-142393-0056,my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you and this moment now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love i have a fulness of strength,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
482,1963-142393-0057,to bear and do our heavenly father's will that i had lost before adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes then we'll never part any more dinah till death parts us and they kissed each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
483,1963-147036-0000,the confession of odette rider he could only gaze in stupified silence you he said wonderingly the girl was pale and her eyes never left his face she nodded yes it is i she said in a low voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
484,1963-147036-0001,you he said again and walked towards her he held out his hand and she gave him the wallet without a word sit down he said kindly he thought she was going to faint i hope i didn't hurt you i hadn't the slightest idea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
485,1963-147036-0002,she shook her head oh i'm not hurt she said wearily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
486,1963-147036-0003,she drew a chair to the table and dropped her face upon her hands and he stood by embarrassed almost terrified by this unexpected development so you were the visitor on the bicycle he said at last i didn't suspect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
487,1963-147036-0004,it struck him at that moment that it was not an offence for odette rider to go up to her mother's house on a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers if there was any crime at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
488,1963-147036-0005,she looked up at his words i on the bicycle she asked no it was not i not you she shook her head i was in the grounds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
489,1963-147036-0006,i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet she said listlessly but i was not on the bicycle who was it he asked she shook her head may i have that please,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
490,1963-147036-0007,she held out her hand and he hesitated after all he had no right or title to this curious purse he compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it odette he said gently and walked round to her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
491,1963-147036-0008,laying his hand on her shoulder why don't you tell me tell you what she asked without looking up tell me all there is to be told he said i could help you i want to help you she looked up at him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
492,1963-147036-0009,he was tongue tied for a second because i love you he said and his voice shook it did not seem to him that he was talking the words came of their own volition he had no more intention of telling her he loved her indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
493,1963-147036-0010,he had no more idea that he did love her than whiteside would have had yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips the effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
494,1963-147036-0011,she did not shrink back she did not look surprised she showed no astonishment whatever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
495,1963-147036-0012,oh that calm,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
496,1963-147036-0013,was the second shock of the evening it was as though she had known it all along he was on his knees by her side and his arm was about her shoulders even before his brain had willed the act my girl my girl he said gently won't you please tell me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
497,1963-147036-0014,her head was still bent and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible tell you what she asked what you know of this business he said don't you realise how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
498,1963-147036-0015,what business do you mean he hesitated the murder of thornton lyne i know nothing of that she made no response to that tender arm of his but sat rigid something in her attitude chilled him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
499,1963-147036-0016,and he dropped her hand and rose when she looked up she saw that his face was white and set he walked to the door and unlocked it i'm not going to ask you any more he said quietly you know best why you came to me to night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
500,1963-147036-0017,she got up to her feet unsteadily and swayed toward him in a second he was by her side his arms about her she made no resistance but rather he felt a yielding towards him which he had missed before her pale face was upturned to his and he stooped and kissed her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
501,1963-147036-0018,odette odette he whispered don't you realise that i love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness won't you tell me everything please no no no she murmured with a little catch in her voice please don't ask me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
502,1963-147036-0019,i am afraid oh i am afraid he crushed her in his arms his cheek against hers his lips tingling with the caress of her hair but there is nothing to be afraid of nothing he said eagerly if you were as guilty as hell i would save you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
503,1963-147036-0020,if you are shielding somebody i would shield them because i love you odette no no she cried and pushed him back both her little hands pressing against his chest don't ask me don't ask me ask me tarling swung round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
504,1963-147036-0021,there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him milburgh he said between his teeth milburgh smiled the other mockingly i am sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
505,1963-147036-0022,but the occasion is a desperate one and i cannot afford to stand on ceremony mister tarling tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager one comprehensive glance the detective gave him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
506,1963-147036-0023,noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood so you were the cyclist eh he said that's right said milburgh it is an exercise to which i am very partial what do you want asked tarling alert and watchful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
507,1963-147036-0024,i want you to carry out your promise mister tarling said milburgh smoothly tarling stared at him my promise he said what promise to protect not only the evil doer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
508,1963-147036-0025,tarling started do you mean to say he said hoarsely do you mean to accuse i accuse nobody said milburgh with a wide sweep of his hands i merely suggest that both miss rider and myself are in very serious trouble,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
509,1963-147036-0026,and that you have it in your power to get us safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow tarling took one step towards him and milburgh shrank back do you accuse miss rider of complicity in this murder he demanded milburgh smiled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
510,1963-147036-0027,but it was an uneasy smile i make no accusation he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
511,1963-147036-0028,he shrugged his shoulders you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which i was endeavouring to remove to a place of safety tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it i shall see the contents of this wallet to morrow he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
512,1963-147036-0029,locks will present very little difficulty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
513,1963-147036-0030,and pulled from his pocket a chain at the end of which dangled a small bunch of keys here is the key he said unlock and read to night tarling took the key in his hand inserted it in first one tiny lock and then in the other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
514,1963-147036-0031,the catches snapped open and he threw back the flap then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girl's quivering face and read the terror in her eyes no no she cried almost beside herself no for god's sake no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

577,1926-143879-0004,too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
578,1926-143879-0005,since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always reigned she wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
579,1926-143879-0006,grave she found herself and positively more weighted as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
580,1926-143879-0007,a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at gardencourt a couple of years before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
581,1926-143879-0008,if her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
582,1926-143879-0009,with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
583,1926-143879-0010,she had left her husband behind her but had brought her children to whom isabel now played with equal munificence and tenderness the part of maiden aunt mister ludlow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
584,1926-143879-0011,the little ludlows had not yet even from the american point of view,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
585,1926-143879-0012,lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
586,1926-143879-0013,and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
587,1926-143879-0014,and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
588,1926-143879-0015,missus ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
589,1926-143879-0016,missus ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently various,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
590,1926-143879-0017,which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
591,1926-143879-0018,on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
592,1926-143879-0019,isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lily's understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
593,1926-143879-0020,the trophies lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this was exactly what she had expected of isabel to give it form and body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
594,1926-143879-0021,we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
595,1926-143879-0022,than that she didn't wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
596,1926-143879-0023,but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabel's silence about mister osmond for instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
597,1926-143879-0024,was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to missus ludlow that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
598,1926-143879-0025,it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
599,1926-143879-0026,the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in the street lamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
600,1926-143879-0027,and euston square was a long way from piccadilly but isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
601,1926-143879-0028,set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets the moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
602,1926-143879-0029,she made her way down to rome without touching at florence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
603,1926-143879-0030,in the september previous had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
604,1926-143879-0031,and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mister bantling that he would soon come over,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
605,1926-143879-0032,had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame merle that they should make a little pilgrimage to the east madame merle remarked that her friend was restless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
606,1926-143879-0033,but she added that she herself had always been consumed with the desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
607,1926-143879-0034,isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
608,1926-143879-0035,her character had revealed itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
609,1926-143879-0036,a consummation the more desirable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
610,1926-143879-0037,she considered with the presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
611,1926-143879-0038,an occasional lapse from candour in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
612,1926-143879-0039,and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
613,1926-143879-0040,advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
614,1926-143879-0041,but it stood for a high water mark in the ebb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
615,1926-143879-0042,a stationary affection in other words was impossible it must move one way or the other however that might be the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
616,1926-143879-0043,i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo or as she stood among the broken columns of the acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
617,1926-143879-0044,deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
618,1926-143879-0045,during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone to lodge made it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
619,1926-143879-0046,and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini madame merle on this occasion remaining in rome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
620,1926-147987-0000,the day after the cutters left antonia came over to see us grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted you've got something on your mind antonia she said anxiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
621,1926-147987-0001,she hesitated and then told us how strangely mister cutter had behaved before he went away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
622,1926-147987-0002,as he had just put a new yale lock on the front door cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
623,1926-147987-0003,or the way he looked at her i feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
624,1926-147987-0004,grandmother was apprehensive at once i don't think it's right for you to stay there feeling that way i suppose it would n't be right for you to leave the place alone either,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
625,1926-147987-0005,maybe jim would be willing to go over there and sleep and you could come here nights i'd feel safer knowing you were under my own roof i guess jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
626,1926-147987-0006,antonia turned to me eagerly oh would you jim,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
627,1926-147987-0007,the third night i spent at the cutters i awoke suddenly with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut everything was still however and i must have gone to sleep again immediately,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
628,1926-147987-0008,i was only half awake but i decided that he might take the cutters silver whoever he was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
629,1926-147987-0009,i held my breath and lay absolutely still a hand closed softly on my shoulder and at the same moment i felt something hairy and cologne scented brushing my face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
630,1926-147987-0010,the man became insane he stood over me choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse so this is what she's up to when i'm away is it where is she you nasty whelp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
631,1926-147987-0011,where is she under the bed are you hussy i know your tricks wait till i get at you i'll fix this rat you've got in here he's caught all right so long as cutter had me by the throat there was no chance for me at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
632,1926-147987-0012,when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to do anything about it i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hatrack lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
633,1926-147987-0013,her cry of fright awakened me truly i was a battered object as she helped me to my room i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my lip was cut and stood out like a snout my nose looked like a big blue plum,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
634,1926-147987-0014,and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have the doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
635,1926-147987-0015,she seemed to understand though i was too faint and miserable to go into explanations when she took,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
636,1926-147987-0016,she spent the whole morning bathing and poulticing me and rubbing me with arnica i heard antonia sobbing outside my door but i asked grandmother to send her away i felt that i never wanted to see her again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
637,1926-147987-0017,she had let me in for all this disgustingness grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antonia but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
638,1926-147987-0018,if the story once got abroad i would never hear the last of it i could well imagine what the old men down at the drug store would do with such a theme,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

640,1926-147987-0020,my own garments had been treated so badly that i never saw them again grandmother burned them in the cutters kitchen range while antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it the front door bell rang violently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
641,1926-147987-0021,there stood missus cutter locked out for she had no key to the new lock her head trembling with rage i advised her to control herself or she would have a stroke grandmother said afterwards,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
642,1926-147987-0022,antonia was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told missus cutter it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then missus cutter told her story,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
643,1926-147987-0023,she and her husband had started home from omaha together the morning before they had to stop over several hours at waymore junction to catch the black hawk train,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
644,1926-147987-0024,when he returned he told her that he would have to stay overnight there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
645,1926-147987-0025,she saw him slip a twenty dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket that bill she said should have aroused her suspicions at once but did not the trains are never called at little junction towns everybody knows when they come in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
646,1926-147987-0026,mister cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
647,1926-147987-0027,and that cutter must have planned it so the conductor told her the black hawk train was due at waymore twelve minutes after the kansas city train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to black hawk without her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
648,1926-147987-0028,she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omaha hotel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
649,1926-147987-0029,but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible mister cutter will pay for this missus burden he will pay missus cutter avouched nodding her horselike head and rolling her eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
650,1926-147987-0030,certainly cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil in some way he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her hysterical nature perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
651,1926-147987-0031,than from any experiences of his own his zest in debauchery might wane but never missus cutter's belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

654,7780-274562-0002,from his cradle to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
655,7780-274562-0003,the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of turgot price priestley and condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
656,7780-274562-0004,what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma that in man's physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
657,7780-274562-0005,the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of his career has taught me to understand that in general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
658,7780-274562-0006,that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content and that even now in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the social condition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
659,7780-274562-0007,it is not impossible that man the individual under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
660,7780-274562-0008,and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert it is indeed evident,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
661,7780-274562-0009,experience mister ellison would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
662,7780-274562-0010,but it is by no means my present object to pen an essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words he admitted but four unvarying laws,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
663,7780-274562-0011,or rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air the health he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
664,7780-274562-0012,attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name he pointed to the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class are proverbially more happy than others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
665,7780-274562-0013,and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox hunter his second principle was the love of woman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
666,7780-274562-0014,his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he held that other things being equal the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
667,7780-274562-0015,i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
668,7780-274562-0016,his intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
669,7780-274562-0017,his possessions had been always ample but upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
670,7780-274562-0018,and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it appears that about one hundred years prior to mister ellison's attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
671,7780-274562-0019,ellison this gentlemen had amassed a princely fortune and having no very immediate connexions conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
672,7780-274562-0020,minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the end of the hundred years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
673,7780-274562-0021,many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character rendered them abortive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
674,7780-274562-0022,a decree finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison upon his twenty first birth day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
675,7780-274562-0023,from entering into possession as the heir of his ancestor seabright of a fortune of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
676,7780-274562-0024,there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
677,7780-274562-0025,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
678,7780-274562-0026,it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigues or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
679,7780-274562-0027,or devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large specimens of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters and art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
680,7780-274562-0028,but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to figures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
681,7780-274562-0029,and figures but sufficed to confound it was seen that even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
682,7780-274562-0030,which was one million and one hundred and twenty five thousand per month or thirty six thousand nine hundred and eighty six per day or one thousand five hundred and forty one per hour or,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
683,7780-274562-0031,six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to imagine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
684,7780-274562-0032,enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance i was not surprised however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
685,7780-274562-0033,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet he comprehended moreover the true character the august aims,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
686,7780-274562-0034,the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some peculiarities either in his early education,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
687,7780-274562-0035,or in the nature of his intellect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
688,7780-274562-0036,and it was this bias perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
689,7780-274562-0037,was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its every day acceptation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
690,7780-274562-0038,or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his which i have already mentioned the idea that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
691,7780-274562-0039,is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
692,7780-274562-0040,and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen and that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
693,7780-274562-0041,unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion the world will never behold that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer productions of art,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
694,7780-274562-0042,of which the human nature is absolutely capable mister ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
695,7780-274562-0043,under other circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become a painter the field of sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
696,7780-274562-0044,was too limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied at any time much of his attention and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
697,7780-274562-0045,even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating i mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
698,7780-274562-0046,no definition had spoken of the landscape gardener as of the poet yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the landscape garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
699,7780-274562-0047,here was indeed the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
700,7780-274562-0048,the elements which should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in the multiform of the tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

702,7780-274562-0050,he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment of his destiny as poet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
703,7780-274562-0051,its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth in his explanation of this phraseology mister ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma i mean the fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
704,7780-274562-0052,which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
705,7780-274562-0053,while the component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short no position can be attained,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
706,7780-274562-0054,from which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
707,7780-274562-0055,in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
708,7780-274562-0056,the criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
709,7780-274562-0057,of human loveliness do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path byron who often erred erred not in saying i've seen more living beauty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
710,7780-274562-0058,ripe and real than all the nonsense of their stone ideal in landscape alone is the principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
711,7780-274562-0059,it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art having i say felt its truth here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
712,7780-274562-0060,for the feeling is no affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist he not only believes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
713,7780-274562-0061,but positively knows that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form constitute and alone constitute the true beauty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
714,7780-274562-0062,yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
715,7780-274562-0063,in his instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his compeers let a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
716,7780-274562-0064,let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity be admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective composition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
717,7780-274562-0065,each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
718,7780-274562-0066,therefore her susceptibility of improvement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
719,7780-274562-0067,it was mister ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
720,7780-274562-0068,that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
721,7780-274562-0069,it is easily understood says mister ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a general and more distantly observed effect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
722,7780-274562-0070,he spoke upon this topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance which is little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
723,7780-274562-0071,or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class of beings human once but now to humanity invisible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
724,7780-274562-0072,for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful more especially than for our own had been set in order by god the great landscape garden of the whole earth in the course of our discussion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
725,7780-274562-0073,to have well treated this theme there are properly he writes but two styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
726,7780-274562-0074,one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
727,7780-274562-0075,detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of the natural style of gardening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
728,7780-274562-0076,in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
729,7780-274562-0077,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english style,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
730,7780-274562-0078,which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
731,7780-274562-0079,a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral a terrace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
732,7780-274562-0080,calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
733,7780-274562-0081,from what i have already observed said mister ellison you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
734,7780-274562-0082,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
735,7780-274562-0083,what is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much or little or nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
736,7780-274562-0084,that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
737,7780-274562-0085,is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius the merit suggested is at best negative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
738,7780-274562-0086,and appertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate addison into apotheosis in truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
739,7780-274562-0087,appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes and flames in invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
740,7780-274562-0088,rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance to the virtues which deny or refrain beyond these the critical art can but suggest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
741,7780-274562-0089,we may be instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a tempest an inferno a prometheus bound a nightingale,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
742,7780-274562-0090,such as that of keats or the sensitive plant of shelley but the thing done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
743,7780-274562-0091,the sophists of the negative school who through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
744,7780-274562-0092,in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
745,7780-274562-0093,are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
746,7780-274562-0094,i repeat that the principle here expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
747,7780-274562-0095,yet which if attained would lend a charm to the landscape garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
748,7780-274562-0096,so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in bringing about such result,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
749,7780-274562-0097,he secures all the advantages of interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
750,7780-274562-0098,in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
751,7780-274562-0099,now if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
752,7780-274562-0100,definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
753,7780-274562-0101,then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god nor an emanation of god,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
754,7780-274562-0102,in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

767,2518-154825-0009,and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a charge in air so one thing we can do is to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
768,2518-154825-0010,and they will take thee alive and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
769,2518-154825-0011,so only gave a sigh wishing heartily that maskew were not dead and that my leg were not broke but that i was back again at the why not or even hearing one of doctor sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
770,2518-154825-0012,there is yet another way that we may try and if thou hadst but two whole legs i would have tried it but now tis little short of madness and yet if thou fear'st not i will still try it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
771,2518-154825-0013,just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle path leads down but not a hundred yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
772,2518-154825-0014,where the under cliff dies back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it and of men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
773,2518-154825-0015,i never heard but one had climbed it and that was lander jordan when the excise was on his heels half a century back but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
774,2518-154825-0016,yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry thee some way and where there is no room to carry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
775,2518-154825-0017,it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
776,2518-154825-0018,tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
777,2518-154825-0019,and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the under cliff,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
778,2518-154825-0020,and twas a task that might cow the bravest and when i looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
779,2518-154825-0021,for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
780,2518-154825-0022,faugh said elzevir tis a poor beast has lost his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
781,2518-154825-0023,and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and tis too late now to change counsel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
782,2518-154825-0024,we have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hour's start or more for they will take all that to search the under cliff and maskew too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
783,2518-154825-0025,will keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
784,2518-154825-0026,so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
785,2518-154825-0027,in a minute i knew from elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path even free and untrammelled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
786,2518-154825-0028,and not a man in all the world to do it with a full grown lad in his arms yet elzevir made no bones of it nor spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
787,2518-154825-0029,thus he went on for a time that seemed without end and yet was really but a minute or two and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive at all on the under cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliff side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
788,2518-154825-0030,and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
789,2518-154825-0031,but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
790,2518-154825-0032,the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
791,2518-154825-0033,for there is no room to dance hornpipes here and hold thy eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither down nor seaward twas well he told me what to do and well i did it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
792,2518-154825-0034,but spent much time that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
793,2518-154825-0035,forgetting what i suffered cried out quicken thy pace lad if thou canst the time is short now so frail is man's temper that though he was doing more than any ever did to save another's life and was all i had to trust to in the world yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
794,2518-154825-0036,but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
795,2518-154825-0037,and then while he knelt down upon the path,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
796,2518-154825-0038,putting my arms round his neck and so he bore me pickaback i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
797,2518-154825-0039,both were on all fours now elzevir first and i following but as i crept along i relaxed care for a moment and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down and far below,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
798,2518-154825-0040,i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
799,2518-154825-0041,felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
800,2518-154825-0042,and how he did it in such a narrow strait i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
801,2518-154825-0043,i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
802,2518-154825-0044,so i gave out one two three and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself though his words seemed thin and far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
803,2518-154825-0045,and in five more they will be on the under cliff and if we ever reach the top who knows but they have left a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag and if they knew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
804,2518-154825-0046,like sitting guillemots against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
805,2518-154825-0047,thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
806,2518-154825-0048,i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
807,2518-154825-0049,i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gulls seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
808,2518-154825-0050,there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are lost pluck up thy courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
809,2518-154825-0051,move thou must and tis better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
810,2518-154825-0052,now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
811,2518-154825-0053,so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskew's body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
812,2518-154825-0054,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright of falling left me in a moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
813,2518-154825-0055,and i could open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands and knees and elzevir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
814,2518-154825-0056,thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
815,2518-154826-0000,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver grey film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
816,2518-154826-0001,with the straight sunpath across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
817,2518-154826-0002,and the wind which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seemed now but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew apace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
818,2518-154826-0003,and i fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
819,2518-154826-0004,there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
820,2518-154826-0005,there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of sleep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
821,2518-154826-0006,and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
822,2518-154826-0007,this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbeck which they call joseph's pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
823,2518-154826-0008,and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
824,2518-154826-0009,that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
825,2518-154826-0010,it was after noon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
826,2518-154826-0011,the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
827,2518-154826-0012,behind one of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush elzevir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry thee no farther for this present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
828,2518-154826-0013,though there is not now much farther to go we have passed purbeck gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
829,2518-154826-0014,and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now tis different,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
830,2518-154826-0015,so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
831,2518-154826-0016,i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound' and he took maskew's silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
832,2518-154826-0017,with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
833,2518-154826-0018,and now that i was under the lee of the wall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
834,2518-154826-0019,and gets at length into shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzevir i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to lull me to slumber,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
835,2518-154826-0020,then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
836,2518-154826-0021,that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones then i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
837,2518-154826-0022,but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
838,2518-154826-0023,and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
839,2518-154826-0024,enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
840,2518-154826-0025,we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall and so elzevir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
841,2518-154826-0026,but elzevir passed him the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer topp was the answer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
842,2518-154826-0027,have you got a charge of powder to spare said elzevir showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows he whispered to me to lie still,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
843,2518-154826-0028,no time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
844,2518-154826-0029,and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
845,2518-154826-0030,but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more says elzevir the tempter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
846,2518-154826-0031,the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
847,2518-154826-0032,for while he spoke i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied round my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the firelock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
848,2518-154826-0033,these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hill side come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
849,2518-154826-0034,and so i said as much to elzevir who only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
850,2518-154826-0035,but when elzevir sat down the boy gave a careful look round and seeing no one watching any more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
851,2518-154826-0036,then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hill brow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is past already,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
852,2518-154826-0037,we must have slept three hours or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john tis when the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posse might have had us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with a lusty stride,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
853,2518-154826-0038,and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
854,2518-154826-0039,elzevir was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
855,2518-154826-0040,although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbeck marble which you see in old churches in our country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
856,2518-154826-0041,and i am told in other parts of england as well and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned askew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
857,2518-154826-0042,from the bottom of this shaft there spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly six feet high but sometimes only three or four and in these the marble is dug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
858,2518-154826-0043,which was just putting on the brighter green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment had covered for the most part,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
859,2518-154826-0044,though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peering out at the top of a mound there were many tumble down walls and low gables left of the cottages of the old quarrymen grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
860,2518-154826-0045,and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
861,2518-154826-0046,on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of the shafts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
862,2518-154826-0047,for if it were not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
863,2518-154826-0048,and the sward crept over the edges of the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
864,2518-154826-0049,there he said this is joseph's pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
865,2518-154826-0050,and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as one goes down a hatchway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
866,2518-154826-0051,and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
867,2518-154826-0052,he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
868,2518-154826-0053,and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
869,2518-154826-0054,and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and lit a match,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
870,4830-25904-0000,being alone in london yet wishing to celebrate the day i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoological gardens a lovely place it was and i enjoyed myself immensely for may day in england is just what it should be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
871,4830-25904-0001,mild sunny flowery and spring like as i walked along the well kept paths between white and rosy hawthorn hedges i kept coming upon new and curious sights,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
872,4830-25904-0002,for the birds and beasts are so skilfully arranged that it is more like travelling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a menagerie the first thing i saw was a great american bison,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
873,4830-25904-0003,and i was so glad to meet with any one from home that i'd have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me he didn't however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
874,4830-25904-0004,and put down his immense head with a sullen snort as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
875,4830-25904-0005,so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelicans i never knew before what handsome birds they were not graceful but with such snowy plumage tinged with pale pink and faint yellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
876,4830-25904-0006,they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
877,4830-25904-0007,when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it till the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
878,4830-25904-0008,and there found a splendid sight six lions and lionesses in three or four different cages sitting or standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
879,4830-25904-0009,one lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
880,4830-25904-0010,i liked this lion very much for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
881,4830-25904-0011,some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
882,4830-25904-0012,it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and every one laughed at the sound there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
883,4830-25904-0013,i sat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
884,4830-25904-0014,and all to get very much excited about something sniffing at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
885,4830-25904-0015,this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
886,4830-25904-0016,gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
887,4830-25904-0017,for they tumbled one over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
888,4830-25904-0018,one lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw and he clutched it trying to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
889,4830-25904-0019,as if a whole family of wild beasts were after her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
890,4830-25904-0020,the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
891,4830-25904-0021,one little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner which was an example to the rest the lions ate in dignified silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
892,4830-25904-0022,all but my favourite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned away with a plaintive moan which seemed to grieve him sadly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
893,4830-25904-0023,he wouldn't touch his dinner but lay down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger till his mate could share it with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
894,4830-25904-0024,as i took a last look at his fine old face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad douglas douglas tender and true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
895,4830-25904-0025,as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
896,4830-25904-0026,who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers a mamma sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the gray monkey with the blue nose scolded at me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
897,4830-25904-0027,he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at every one like an ill tempered old bachelor half a dozen little ones teased him capitally by dropping bits of bread,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
898,4830-25904-0028,nut shells and straws down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail i'm afraid the gray one bit it off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
899,4830-25904-0029,and kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldn't hold him and down he'd go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
900,4830-25904-0030,bounce on to the straw at first he'd sit and stare about him as if much amazed to find himself there then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
901,4830-25904-0031,and finally he'd examine his poor little tail and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
902,4830-25904-0032,and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away the snake house came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family i rather like snakes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
903,4830-25904-0033,since i had a tame green one who lived under the door step and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out and i wasn't allowed to poke them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
904,4830-25904-0034,and blinked at me through the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakes black brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain ones but i liked the great boa,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
905,4830-25904-0035,best when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wonder i hope he hasn't got,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
906,4830-25904-0036,out i said to myself thinking of a story i read once of a person in a menagerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding towards him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
907,4830-25904-0037,as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boa's glittering eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
908,4830-25904-0038,and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainous looking reptile he was and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
909,4830-25904-0039,where such unpleasant neighbours might pop in upon you unexpectedly he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
910,4830-25904-0040,and then knotted his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fiery eyed head in the middle he was not one of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
911,4830-25904-0041,which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive i was walking toward the camel's pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face it's the boa i thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
912,4830-25904-0042,much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
913,4830-25904-0043,i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
914,4830-25904-0044,hoping to find something eatable i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees flocks of snow white cranes stalking over the grass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
915,4830-25904-0045,on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes chasing one another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
916,4830-25904-0046,and in an immense wire covered aviary all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as gaily as if at home one of the curiosities was a sea cow who lived in a tank of salt water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
917,4830-25904-0047,and came at the keeper's call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had four fins instead of two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
918,4830-25904-0048,its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
919,4830-25904-0049,the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water or sitting on a block of ice panting as if the mild spring day was blazing midsummer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
920,4830-25904-0050,he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
921,4830-25898-0000,there never was a prouder mamma than madam cluck when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks chanticleer strut snowball speckle peep peck downy and blot were their names,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
922,4830-25898-0001,and no sooner were they out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as gaily as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their especial benefit it was a fine brood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
923,4830-25898-0002,but poor madam cluck had bad luck with her chicks for they were her first and she didn't know how to manage them old aunt cockletop told her that she didn't and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
924,4830-25898-0003,aunt cockletop was right as you will see when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family the tragedy began with chanty who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
925,4830-25898-0004,before he had a feather to his bit of a tail chanty began to fight and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farm yard having pecked his brothers and sisters he tried to do the same to his playmates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
926,4830-25898-0005,the ducklings goslings and young turkeys and was so disagreeable that all the fowls hated him one day a pair of bantams arrived pretty little white birds with red crests and nice yellow feet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
927,4830-25898-0006,chanty thought he could beat mister bantam easily he was so small and invited him to fight mister b declined then chanty called him a coward and gave missus b a peck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
928,4830-25898-0007,which ended in chanty's utter defeat for he died from his wounds downy and snowball soon followed for the two sweet little things would swing on the burdock leaves that grew over the brook,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
929,4830-25898-0008,sitting side by side the plump sisters were placidly swaying up and down over the clear brown water rippling below when ah sad to relate the stem broke and down went leaf,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
930,4830-25898-0009,chickens and all to a watery death i'm the most unlucky hen ever hatched groaned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
931,4830-25898-0010,and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with aunt cockletop grasshoppering they called it in the great field across the road,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
932,4830-25898-0011,what a nice time speckle did have to be sure for the grasshoppers were lively and fat and aunt was in an unusually amiable mood never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
933,4830-25898-0012,like a brave chick said the old biddy as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
934,4830-25898-0013,the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give one loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her little speckle remembering the advice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
935,4830-25898-0014,and unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away chirping dismally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
936,4830-25898-0015,what shall i do it was a dreadful blow to missus cluck and aunt cockletop didn't show herself for a whole day after that story was known,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
937,4830-25898-0016,for every fowl in the yard twitted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
938,4830-25898-0017,he was at it from morning till night and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill small voice making funny attempts to produce hoarse little crows as he sat on the wall and stretched his yellow neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
939,4830-25898-0018,till his throat quite ached with the effort ah if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear i should be perfectly happy said this silly little fowl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
940,4830-25898-0019,so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

944,4830-25898-0023,for poor strut he leaned so far forward in his frantic effort to get a big crow out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor killing himself instantly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
945,4830-25898-0024,for some time after this missus cluck kept her three remaining little ones close to her side watching over them with maternal care till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings peep and peck were always together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

950,4830-25898-0029,and having taken a taste of every thing she was about to leave when she heard the stableman coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the meal bin and hid herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
951,4830-25898-0030,sam never saw her but shut down the cover of the bin as he passed and left poor peep to die no one knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

959,4830-25898-0038,gasping and rolling up her eyes in great anguish for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt and there was no help for her when all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush covered the little grave with chickweed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
960,4830-25898-0039,and the bereaved parent wore a black string round her leg for a month blot the last of that bright band needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow this was the reason why her mother never,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
961,4830-25898-0040,had loved her as much as she did the others who were all white gray or yellow poor little blot had been much neglected by every one but now her lonely mamma discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
962,4830-25898-0041,for blot was a great comfort to her never running away or disobeying in any way but always close to her side ready to creep under her wing or bring her a plump bug when the poor biddy's appetite failed her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
963,4830-25898-0042,they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farm yard for turkeys hens ducks and geese fell a prey to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
964,4830-25898-0043,and were seen by their surviving relatives featherless pale and stiff borne away to some unknown place whence no fowl returned blot was waked one night by a great cackling and fluttering in the hen house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
965,4830-25898-0044,and peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pull her off screaming dolefully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
966,4830-25898-0045,aunt cockletop pecked and croaked fiercely but tough as she was the old biddy did not escape and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
967,4830-25898-0046,in the morning few remained and blot felt that she was a forlorn orphan a thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours brooding over her sad lot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
968,4830-25898-0047,and longing to join her family in some safe and happy land where fowls live in peace she had her wish very soon for one day when the first snowflakes began to flutter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
969,4830-25898-0048,blot saw a little kitten mewing pitifully as it sat under the fence what is the matter dear asked kind blot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
970,4830-25898-0049,i live at the red farm house over the hill only i don't know which road to take i'll show you come at once for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for us said blot so away they went,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
971,4830-25898-0050,but it was a long way and dusk came on before the red farm house appeared now i'm safe thank you very much won't you come in and stay all night my mother will be glad to see you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
972,4830-25898-0051,said the kit rubbing her soft white face against blot's little black breast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
973,4830-25898-0052,so good by dear and off trotted blot along the snowy road hoping to get home before the hen house door was shut faster and faster fell the snow darker and darker grew the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
974,4830-25898-0053,and colder and colder became poor blot's little feet as she waded through the drifts the firelight was shining out into the gloom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
975,4830-25898-0054,to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her but the bough of a leafless tree too stiff and weak to fly up she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the door step,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
976,4830-25898-0055,and with a shiver put her little head under her wing trying to forget hunger weariness and the bitter cold and wait patiently for morning but when morning came little blot lay frozen stiff under a coverlet of snow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
977,2893-139322-0000,chapter twenty one the under side from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufactures was done,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
978,2893-139322-0001,on their way the platforms crossed the thames twice and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
979,2893-139322-0002,the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights a string of black barges passed seaward manned by blue clad men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
980,2893-139322-0003,the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labour department was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
981,2893-139322-0004,struck graham most vividly one lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
982,2893-139322-0005,and blotted out the picture presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
983,2893-139322-0006,the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuit making place of the potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
984,2893-139322-0007,the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
985,2893-139322-0008,but wherever there was work it was being done by slow moving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work places and the orange clad labour police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
986,2893-139322-0009,the voluntary vigours of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter day workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
987,2893-139322-0010,who were directing their labours the burly labourers of the old victorian times had followed that dray horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
988,2893-139322-0011,the latter day labourer male as well as female was essentially a machine minder and feeder a servant and attendant or an artist under direction the women in comparison with those graham remembered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
989,2893-139322-0012,were as a class distinctly plain and flat chested two hundred years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion two hundred years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigour from the blue canvas myriads,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
990,2893-139322-0013,to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendours and delights and at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
991,2893-139322-0014,to the euthanasy and peace to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities of graham's former life the newly aggregated labouring mass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
992,2893-139322-0015,had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a high morality now it was differentiating into an instinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own even with a dialect of its own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
993,2893-139322-0016,they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
994,2893-139322-0017,the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
995,2893-139322-0018,he came to the warren of the jewellers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
996,2893-139322-0019,each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
997,2893-139322-0020,had the oddest effect the work was beautifully executed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
998,2893-139322-0021,for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this on coming to work but at night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
999,2893-139322-0022,in spite of every precaution the labour policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1000,2893-139322-0023,many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion asano apologised to graham for this offensive sight but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1001,2893-139322-0024,this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement she might have done better with herself than that said asano,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1002,2893-139322-0025,graham made some indignant comments but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1003,2893-139322-0026,and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen three barges smothered in floury dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1004,2893-139322-0027,by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white washed wall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1005,2893-139322-0028,every now and then one would stop to cough a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1006,2893-139322-0029,their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing stop that shouted one of the policemen but the order was disobeyed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1007,2893-139322-0030,and first one and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1008,2893-139322-0031,the policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1009,2893-139322-0032,that walk left on graham's mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1010,2893-139322-0033,the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pin point lights here was the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1011,2893-139322-0034,and here unprecedented reeks everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1012,2893-139322-0035,even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation once and again and again a third time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1013,2893-139322-0036,graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1014,2893-139322-0037,when he saw a number of blue clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labour police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1015,2893-139322-0038,but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1016,2893-139322-0039,they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1017,2893-139322-0040,then a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran what has happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1018,2893-139322-0041,that men yelled to one another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1019,2893-139322-0042,he hesitated looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew but how can they know asked asano graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1020,2893-139322-0043,and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms toward him bawling again and again in good english this is ostrog's doing ostrog the knave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1021,2893-139322-0044,he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1022,2893-139322-0045,he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1023,2893-139322-0046,the master is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1024,2893-139322-0047,he said i might have known the hour has come he thought swiftly what am i to do go back to the council house said asano why should i not appeal the people are here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1025,2893-139322-0048,you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them suppose this is only a rumour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1026,2893-139322-0049,it sounds true said asano let us have the facts said graham,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1027,2893-139322-0050,even now the ruins may be impassable graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one and there asano accosted a labourer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech what did he say asked graham,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1028,2893-139322-0051,had not someone in the wind vane offices learnt he said a girl a girl not he said a girl he did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1029,2893-139322-0052,and then another thing was shouted something that turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements it came like a wind along the street,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1030,2893-139310-0000,the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was glowing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1031,2893-139310-0001,a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1032,2893-139310-0002,behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1033,2893-139310-0003,a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1034,2893-139310-0004,and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1035,2893-139310-0005,he grasped the arm of this shouting person tell me he cried who am i who am i the others came nearer to hear his words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1036,2893-139310-0006,his eyes searched their faces they have told him nothing cried the girl tell me tell me cried graham you are the master of the earth you are owner of the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1037,2893-139310-0007,he did not believe he heard aright he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i have been awake three days a prisoner three days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1038,2893-139310-0008,it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1039,2893-139310-0009,councillors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1040,2893-139310-0010,because you are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name the sounds from the hall had died into a silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1041,2893-139310-0011,threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult a roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1042,2893-139310-0012,the people in the little room could not hear each other shout graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1043,2893-139310-0013,but who is ostrog he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1047,2893-139310-0017,the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1051,2893-139310-0021,massed in the inaudible it is now or never the council is rocking they cannot trust even their drilled men hear the people calling to you graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1052,2893-139310-0022,now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1053,2893-139310-0023,on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1054,2893-139310-0024,monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1055,2893-139310-0025,but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1056,2893-139310-0026,and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were bawling for order silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1057,2893-139310-0027,a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1058,2893-139310-0028,he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1059,2893-139310-0029,but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1060,2893-139310-0030,lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1124,78-369-0040,some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1125,78-369-0041,and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1126,78-369-0042,concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1127,78-369-0043,through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1128,78-369-0044,he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1129,78-369-0045,amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1130,78-369-0046,my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1131,78-369-0047,i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1132,78-369-0048,which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1133,78-369-0049,i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1134,78-369-0050,despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1135,78-369-0051,gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1136,78-369-0052,what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1137,78-369-0053,warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the daemon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1138,78-369-0054,when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1139,78-369-0055,my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1140,78-369-0056,as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1141,78-369-0057,and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1142,78-369-0058,several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1143,78-369-0059,i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1144,78-369-0060,but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1145,78-369-0061,oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the daemon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1146,78-369-0062,swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1147,78-369-0063,sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1148,78-368-0000,chapter twenty three it was eight o'clock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1149,78-368-0001,the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1150,78-368-0002,the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1151,78-368-0003,that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1152,78-368-0004,and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1153,78-368-0005,when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1154,78-368-0006,i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1155,78-368-0007,great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1156,78-368-0008,she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1157,78-368-0009,flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1158,78-368-0010,but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1159,78-368-0011,to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1160,78-368-0012,but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1161,78-368-0013,and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1162,78-368-0014,i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1163,78-368-0015,but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1164,78-368-0016,nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1165,78-368-0017,after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1166,78-368-0018,a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1167,78-368-0019,as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1168,78-368-0020,and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1169,78-368-0021,subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1170,78-368-0022,the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1171,78-368-0023,my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1172,78-368-0024,there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1173,78-368-0025,however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1174,78-368-0026,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1175,78-368-0027,but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1176,78-368-0028,know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1177,78-368-0029,and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1178,78-368-0030,misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1179,78-368-0031,sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1180,78-368-0032,melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1181,78-368-0033,the monster whom i had created the miserable daemon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1182,78-368-0034,and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1183,78-368-0035,revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1184,78-368-0036,and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1185,78-368-0037,however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1186,78-368-0038,my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1187,78-368-0039,and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1188,78-368-0040,and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1189,78-368-0041,when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1190,78-368-0042,from the execution of those functions on this occasion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1191,78-368-0043,i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1192,78-368-0044,who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1193,78-368-0045,since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1194,78-368-0046,and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1195,78-368-0047,and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1196,78-368-0048,i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1197,78-368-0049,have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1198,78-368-0050,but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1199,78-368-0051,my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1200,78-368-0052,i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1201,78-368-0053,how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1202,4853-29413-0000,gloody settles the account a night of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1203,4853-29413-0001,the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1204,4853-29413-0002,the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1205,4853-29413-0003,the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me gloody showed himself at the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1206,4853-29413-0004,with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1207,4853-29413-0005,i'm dismissed from my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1208,4853-29413-0006,what did he do flew into a furious rage i don't complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1209,4853-29413-0007,even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mister roylake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you only i don't know how,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1210,4853-29413-0008,in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us two is settled now on both sides,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1211,4853-29413-0009,what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1212,4853-29413-0010,we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1213,4853-29413-0011,the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll answer them to the best of my ability,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1214,4853-29413-0012,the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1215,4853-29413-0013,the cur had betrayed himself it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1216,4853-29413-0014,to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1217,4853-29413-0015,but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1218,4853-29413-0016,gloody was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1219,4853-29413-0017,a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1220,4853-29413-0018,that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1221,4853-29413-0019,it was borne in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1222,4853-29413-0020,the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of you i don't mean any offence sir i pretty well guessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1223,4853-29413-0021,that she was true as steel and not easily frightened i didn't need to guess i knew it gloody had done his best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1224,4853-29413-0022,she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1225,4853-29413-0023,whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea yes well that was one of the signals agreed on between us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1226,4853-29413-0024,how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1227,4853-29413-0025,i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1228,4853-29413-0026,i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was honest honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1229,4853-29413-0027,a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we hav'n't heard of yet mister roylake i had been dressing for some time past longing to see cristel it is needless to say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1230,4853-29413-0028,is there anything more i asked that i ought to know only one thing mister roylake that i can think of gloody replied i'm afraid it's miss cristel's turn next what do you mean,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1231,4853-29413-0029,while the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on miss cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1232,4853-29413-0030,i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1233,4853-29413-0031,had we any proof to justify us gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boat house no oars no oars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1234,4853-29413-0032,and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me nothing sir,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1235,4853-27670-0000,i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvellous,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1236,4853-27670-0001,i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1237,4853-27670-0002,my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armour so inflexibly hard were they frozen yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1238,4853-27670-0003,it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest colour upon the hatchway one thing i quickly noticed that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1239,4853-27670-0004,there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1240,4853-27670-0005,the brig pitched and rolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1241,4853-27670-0006,it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1242,4853-27670-0007,finding that i had the use of my voice i holloaed as loudly as i could but no human note responded three or four times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1243,4853-27670-0008,what has come to pass is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard certainly five men at least were living before we fouled the ice and again i cried out is there any one alive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1244,4853-27670-0009,my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1245,4853-27670-0010,it was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1246,4853-27670-0011,but no feature of my lamentable situation so affrighted me so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for one companion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1247,4853-27670-0012,even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech nay god himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not the blackness lay like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1248,4853-27670-0013,misery and horror were within that shadow and beyond it nothing that my spirit could look up to i stood for some moments as one stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1249,4853-27670-0014,reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas and that after all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1250,4853-27670-0015,her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1251,4853-27670-0016,by preventing the seas which washed on to the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1252,4853-27670-0017,my eyes directly sought it and found the time twenty minutes after ten this signified that i had ten or eleven hours of darkness before me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1253,4853-27670-0018,i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1254,4853-27670-0019,i swallowed half a pannikin of the hollands for the sake of the warmth and life of the draught and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1255,4853-27670-0020,and i then with a seaman's dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1256,4853-27670-0021,i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1257,4853-27670-0022,nevertheless its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1258,4853-27670-0023,but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1259,4853-27670-0024,i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1260,4853-27670-0025,until coming abreast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosy there was a wound over his right brow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1261,4853-27670-0026,and as if that had not sufficed to slay him the fall of the masts had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1262,4853-27670-0027,that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man under a mass of rigging in the larboard scuppers lay two bodies as i could just faintly discern,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1263,4853-27670-0028,for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other gear against which leaned a portion of the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1264,4853-27670-0029,i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seaman named abraham wise near the fore hatch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1265,4853-27670-0030,no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1266,4853-27670-0031,but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1267,4853-27670-0032,i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside weighty enough you would have supposed to stave the ship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1268,4853-27670-0033,nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1269,4853-27670-0034,to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easily have kept her free,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1270,4853-27670-0035,i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1271,4853-27670-0036,and even had i managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1272,4853-27671-0000,there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable pall overhead into blueness the hull lay very deep,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1273,4853-27671-0001,i had at one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1274,4853-27671-0002,and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1275,4853-27671-0003,yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1276,4853-27671-0004,one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1277,4853-27671-0005,had floated the jolly boat out of the long boat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1278,4853-27671-0006,and there lay the long boat crushed into staves this signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1279,4853-27671-0007,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prised her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1280,4853-27671-0008,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1281,4853-27671-0009,but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1282,4853-27671-0010,i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1283,4853-27671-0011,eight or ten biscuits some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flower and thirteen bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1284,4853-27671-0012,the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue brows to her stem,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1285,4853-27671-0013,it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her and if the swell fell over her bows and filled the decks down she would go i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1286,4853-27671-0014,when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her adrift the sun was an hour above the horizon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1287,4853-27671-0015,heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulders of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendour along,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1288,4853-27671-0016,till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1289,4853-27671-0017,shot with pearly lustre floated overhead very high it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the air being dry its shrewdness was endurable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1290,4853-27671-0018,with us had it dawned yesterday instead of to day my companions would have been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1291,4853-27671-0019,i threw the oar over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1292,4853-27671-0020,into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hull floated she was something to hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1293,4853-27671-0021,and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her bulwarks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1294,4853-27671-0022,and which she dragged down with her on a sudden when the last fragment of mast had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea up rose a body with a sort of leap,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1295,4853-27671-0023,it was the sailor that had lain drowned on the starboard side of the forward deck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1296,4853-27671-0024,so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustained by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1297,4853-27671-0025,and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason i rose from the seat on to which i had sunk and loosed the sail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1298,4853-27671-0026,and hauling the sheet aft put the oar over the stern and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course the draught of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1299,4853-27671-0027,the boat was about fifteen feet long,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1300,4853-27671-0028,ere i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer north west and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1301,4853-27671-0029,where perchance i might meet a whaler or a southseaman from new holland but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1302,4853-27671-0030,i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up and that though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1303,4853-27671-0031,than by sailing into the great desolation of the north west the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1304,4853-27671-0032,i am persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly as the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1305,4853-27671-0033,and then all was bare bald swelling sea and empearled sky darkening in lagoons of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapour lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1306,4853-27671-0034,but one living thing there was besides myself a grey breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hull went down and then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1307,4853-27671-0035,lifting my eyes with involuntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1308,4853-27671-0036,it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions and poised on tremorless wings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1309,4853-27671-0037,was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1310,4853-27671-0038,the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me its eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1311,4853-27671-0039,it was as silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1312,4853-27671-0040,it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope flapped its wings and after a turn or two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1313,4018-107338-0000,morley paused as he recognised egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1314,4018-107338-0001,perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1315,4018-107338-0002,and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1316,4018-107338-0003,and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1317,4018-107338-0004,and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1318,4018-107338-0005,that appearance was prepossessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1319,4018-107338-0006,detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1320,4018-107338-0007,is the privilege of the people of whom i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour their labour said sybil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1321,4018-107338-0008,is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1322,4018-107338-0009,then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1323,4018-107338-0010,he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1324,4018-107338-0011,this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1325,4018-107338-0012,he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1326,4018-107338-0013,he would propose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1327,4018-107338-0014,you did well good stephen as you always do said sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1328,4018-107338-0015,hers were kind and calm and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1329,4018-107338-0016,the mystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sybil there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here today he met and addressed me and i only recognised an acquaintance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1330,4018-107338-0017,had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1331,4018-107338-0018,you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1332,4018-107338-0019,he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1333,4018-107338-0020,and yet if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1334,4018-107338-0021,the factions become united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1335,4018-107338-0022,you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1336,4018-107338-0023,but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1337,4018-107338-0024,morley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1338,4018-107338-0025,lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to degrade them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1339,4018-107338-0026,there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephen's itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1340,4018-107338-0027,my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believed that we had on our side god and truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1341,4018-107338-0028,the factions and the failures of our oppressors at this moment gerard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of sybil and morley,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1342,4018-107338-0029,saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of justice that mowbray castle is as much yours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1343,4018-107338-0030,as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land but can we prove it we never had the legal evidence you are in error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1344,4018-107338-0031,very useful no doubt i hope i shall find them but of no validity if money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1345,4018-107338-0032,i'll not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely fit for business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1346,4018-103416-0000,the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one it was marked by an almost feverish gayety as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self interest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1347,4018-103416-0001,mills and factories took on new life labor was scarce and high it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure people played that they might not think washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1348,4018-103416-0002,kept its secret well and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce war was to most of the nation a great dramatic spectacle presented to them at breakfast and in the afternoon editions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1349,4018-103416-0003,for the red cross and kindred activities but although the war was in the nation's mind it was not yet in its soul life went on much as before an abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1350,4018-103416-0004,the great six months battle of the somme with its million casualties was resulting favorably on the east the russians had made some gains there were wagers that the germans would be done in the spring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1351,4018-103416-0005,but again washington knew that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful that the amount of lost territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the british islands was acute,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1353,4018-103416-0007,he was rather bored now at the prospect he would have preferred going to the club to play billiards which was his custom of a late afternoon he drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed marion's invitation to get there before the crowd,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1354,4018-103416-0008,three cars before the house showed that she already had callers and indeed when the parlor maid opened the door a burst of laughter greeted him the hayden house was a general rendezvous there were usually by seven o'clock whiskey and soda glasses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1355,4018-103416-0009,and tea cups on most of the furniture and half smoked cigarets on everything that would hold them including the piano marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing room door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1356,4018-103416-0010,i kept the library as long as i could we can sit on the stairs if you like which they proceeded to do quite amiably from various open doors came subdued voices the air was pungent with tobacco smoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1363,4018-103416-0017,encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1364,4018-103416-0018,her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marion hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1366,4018-103416-0020,she had the far vision of the calculating mind she knew that if the country entered the war every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer at twenty five she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1428,7067-76047-0005,sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seyffert has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1429,7067-76047-0006,on the second occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1430,7067-76047-0007,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1431,7067-76047-0008,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeed and almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady of very good social position indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1432,7067-76047-0009,she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable self control and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1433,7067-76047-0010,i'm twice her age we are a party of four there are conventions there are considerations aren't you really my dear martineau overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1434,7067-76047-0011,am i said doctor martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1435,7067-76047-0012,there were some moments of silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said doctor martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1436,7067-76047-0013,i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kenelm latter at bournemouth nothing simpler than to go to him now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1437,7067-76047-0014,i shall be sorry all the same i could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened a little later the matter was settled nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1438,7067-76047-0015,but neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the the inconveniences your present code would set about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1439,7067-76047-0016,and honour than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1440,7067-76047-0017,but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one and you if you will forgive me are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1441,7067-76047-0018,this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves as if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1442,7067-76047-0019,may involve very serious consequences indeed with which i for one do not wish to be involved sir richmond upon the hearthrug had a curious feeling that he was back in the head master's study at caxton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1443,7067-76047-0020,and in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favoured with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1444,7067-76047-0021,miss seyffert is a fairly crude mixture of frankness insincerity and self explanatory egotism and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1445,7067-76047-0022,now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond you know that she has told me as much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1446,7067-76047-0023,well she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions that is how i inferred that there was no mother i don't think there has been any stepmother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1447,7067-76047-0024,her manner with miss seyffert an excellent manner for miss seyffert by the bye isn't the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day or for one person only she is a very sure and commanding young woman sir richmond nodded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1448,7067-76047-0025,i suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butchered the thing has been done these business americans i am told neglect their womenkind give them money and power let them loose on the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1449,7067-76047-0026,it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honoured amused,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1450,7067-76047-0027,talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time i think this must be near the truth of her biography said sir richmond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1451,7067-76047-0028,i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1452,7067-76047-0029,she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss grammont is not silly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1453,7067-76047-0030,probably bored her more than she realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewellery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1454,7067-76047-0031,and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was twenty i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presents those who seek find,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1455,7067-76047-0032,what do you think she found what would a rich girl find out there in america i don't know i haven't the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1456,7067-76047-0033,she would find that life was worth while to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her sex she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worth while for him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1457,7067-76047-0034,harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance there have been love experiences experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1458,7067-76047-0035,and something more than that what it is i don't know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1459,7067-76047-0036,or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didn't expect it she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth she has ceased to take the world for granted it hasn't broken her but it has matured her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1460,7067-76047-0037,that i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you in her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1461,7067-76047-0038,she sees history as you see it and i see it she is a very grown up young woman it's just that said sir richmond it's just that if you see as much in miss grammont as all that why don't you want to come on with us you see the interest of her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1462,7067-76047-0039,i see a lot more than that you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible negligible that is the exact word to them you can't look at a woman for five minutes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1463,7067-76047-0040,seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity miss grammont has an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoilt child with no discipline,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1464,7067-76047-0041,you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends you on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leeds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1465,7067-76047-0042,you i say are also at loose ends can you deny it my dear sir don't we both know that ever since we left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three ha'porth of kindness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1466,7067-76047-0043,grotesquely happen he said she knows nothing of martin leeds you must remember that and then he added if she and you fall in love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1467,7067-76047-0044,as the phrase goes what is to follow there was a pause sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1468,7067-76047-0045,really he said this is preposterous you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf in our ages in our quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1469,7067-76047-0046,from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing are men and women to go on for ever separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1470,7067-76047-0047,is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you two anyhow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1471,7067-76047-0048,and at present the world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the core of this situation a pause fell between the two gentlemen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1472,7067-76047-0049,they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martineau,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1473,7067-76048-0000,i leave you to it his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation ought you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond i shall be interested to learn what happens but if you won't stay to see,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1474,7067-76048-0001,now sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and doctor martineau got in sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit what else could i do he asked aloud to nobody in particular,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1475,7067-76048-0002,section two for the better part of forty hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1476,7067-76048-0003,and she repeated no remembered comments and prophets of her contemporaries about herself she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1477,7067-76048-0004,but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences and her liking for sir richmond was pleasingly manifest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1478,7067-76048-0005,she liked his turn of thought she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favoured visitor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1479,7067-76048-0006,as a crisis in which they were called upon to do something they did not yet clearly know what into this topic they peered as into some deep pool side by side and in it they saw each other reflected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1480,7067-76048-0007,its delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch both miss grammont and miss seyffert displayed an intelligent interest in their food after lunch they had all gone out to the stones and the wall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1481,7067-76048-0008,to a happy use by clambering to the top of it and sliding on their little behinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1482,7067-76048-0009,sir richmond and miss grammont had walked round the old circumvallation together but belinda seyffert had strayed away from them professing an interest in flowers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1483,7067-76048-0010,that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards that new world of yours of two hundred and fifty million fully developed beautiful and happy people why not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1484,7067-76048-0011,nobody is doing anything with the world except muddle about why not give it a direction you'd take it in your hands like clay obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1485,7067-76048-0012,her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice i believe what you say is possible if people dare i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1486,7067-76048-0013,i am tired of seeing all the world doing the same i am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great disasters here is something mankind can attempt that we can attempt and will i believe that as mankind grows up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1494,7067-76048-0021,it's refreshing to meet you i found it refreshing to meet martineau a twinge of conscience about doctor martineau turned sir richmond into a new channel he's a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1496,7067-76048-0023,the adolescence so to speak of mankind it is an idea that seizes the imagination there is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1497,7067-76048-0024,there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities we are sharing the adolescence of our race it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1498,7067-76048-0025,making them matter as formerly they didn't seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1499,7067-76048-0026,incidentally he smiled i want to get a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbaric person your father i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world control of fuel production and distribution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1501,7067-76048-0028,they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1502,7067-76048-0029,gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1503,7067-76048-0030,you will find my father extremely difficult but some of our younger men would love it and she went on there are american women who'd love it too we're petted we're kept out of things we aren't placed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1504,7067-76048-0031,we don't get enough to do we're spenders and wasters not always from choice while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1505,7067-76048-0032,with all the empty unspeakable solemnity of the male and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings that can't go on she said her eyes went back to the long low undulating skyline of the downs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1506,7067-76048-0033,she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life that isn't going on she said with an effect of conclusive decision,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1507,7067-76048-0034,sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martineau he recalled too the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1508,7067-76048-0035,he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1509,7067-76048-0036,in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality martineau was very fine minded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1510,7067-76048-0037,but passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest then it wasn't so necessary it might happen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1511,7067-76048-0038,her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond i realize i've got to be a responsible american citizen she had said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1512,7067-76048-0039,that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1513,7067-76048-0040,she had no illusions about the power of the former class it didn't exist they were steered to their decisions by people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates the owners of america the real responsible citizens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1514,7067-76048-0041,or they fell a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries but anyhow they were steered she herself it was clear was bound to become a very responsible citizen indeed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1515,7067-76048-0042,she would some day she laughed be swimming in oil and such like property her interest in sir richmond's schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was therefore she realized a very direct one but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1516,7067-76048-0043,father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1517,7067-76048-0044,at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mister grammont's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1518,7067-76048-0045,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1519,7067-76048-0046,he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicability of his life's ideal there was hetty green this latter idea had reft her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1520,7067-76048-0047,after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and an office down town she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mister grammont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1521,7067-76048-0048,she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two menservants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1522,7067-76048-0049,this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into mexico there apparently she had really done responsible work but upon the question of labour mister grammont was fierce,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1523,7067-76048-0050,he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1524,7067-76048-0051,and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1525,7067-76048-0052,mister lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment there was some story however connected with her war services in europe upon which miss grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1526,7067-76048-0053,still quite vaguely guessing so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as allusions or by way of illustration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1527,7067-76048-0054,the sustaining topic was this new age sir richmond fore shadowed this world under scientific control the utopia of fully developed people fully developing the resources of the earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1528,7067-76048-0055,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to doctor martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that doctor martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1529,7067-76048-0056,but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with doctor martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1530,7067-76048-0057,and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise to morrow the new age will be here no doubt but today it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings so that it was natural for miss grammont and sir richmond to ask,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1531,7067-76048-0058,what are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically ordered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1532,7067-76048-0059,an immense organization of mature commonsense healthy and secure gathering knowledge and power for creative adventures as yet beyond dreaming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1533,7067-76048-0060,and replaceable structures indeed both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1534,87-121553-0000,and in its gyre had not turned wholly round before another in a ring enclosed it and motion joined to motion song to song song that as greatly doth transcend our muses our sirens in those dulcet clarions as primal splendour that which is reflected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1535,87-121553-0001,when juno to her handmaid gives command the one without born of the one within like to the speaking of that vagrant one whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1536,87-121553-0002,after the dance and other grand rejoicings both of the singing and the flaming forth effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender together at once with one accord had stopped even as the eyes that as volition moves them must needs together shut and lift themselves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1537,87-121553-0003,out of the heart of one of the new lights there came a voice that needle to the star made me appear in turning thitherward and it began the love that makes me fair draws me to speak about the other leader by whom so well is spoken here of mine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1538,87-121553-0004,tis right where one is to bring in the other that as they were united in their warfare together likewise may their glory shine the soldiery of christ which it had cost so dear to arm again behind the standard moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1539,87-121553-0005,when the emperor who reigneth evermore provided for the host that was in peril through grace alone and not that it was worthy and as was said he to his bride brought succour with champions twain at whose deed at whose word the straggling people were together drawn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1540,87-121553-0006,within that region where the sweet west wind rises to open the new leaves wherewith europe is seen to clothe herself afresh not far off from the beating of the waves behind which in his long career the sun sometimes conceals himself from every man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1542,87-121553-0008,and when it was created was his mind replete with such a living energy that in his mother her it made prophetic as soon as the espousals were complete between him and the faith at holy font where they with mutual safety dowered each other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1543,87-121553-0009,the woman who for him had given assent saw in a dream the admirable fruit that issue would from him and from his heirs and that he might be construed as he was a spirit from this place went forth to name him with his possessive whose he wholly was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1581,87-121553-0047,its brightness is proportioned to the ardour the ardour to the vision and the vision equals what grace it has above its worth when glorious and sanctified our flesh is reassumed then shall our persons be more pleasing by their being all complete,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1582,87-121553-0048,for will increase whate'er bestows on us of light gratuitous the good supreme light which enables us to look on him therefore the vision must perforce increase increase the ardour which from that is kindled increase the radiance which from this proceeds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1585,87-121553-0051,so that the sight seems real and unreal it seemed to me that new subsistences began there to be seen and make a circle outside the other two circumferences o very sparkling of the holy spirit how sudden and incandescent it became unto mine eyes that vanquished bore it not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1586,87-121553-0052,but beatrice so beautiful and smiling appeared to me that with the other sights that followed not my memory i must leave her then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed the power and i beheld myself translated to higher salvation with my lady only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1587,87-121553-0053,well was i ware that i was more uplifted by the enkindled smiling of the star that seemed to me more ruddy than its wont with all my heart and in that dialect which is the same in all such holocaust to god i made as the new grace beseemed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1588,87-121553-0054,and not yet from my bosom was exhausted the ardour of sacrifice before i knew this offering was accepted and auspicious for with so great a lustre and so red splendours appeared to me in twofold rays i said o helios who dost so adorn them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1589,87-121553-0055,even as distinct with less and greater lights glimmers between the two poles of the world the galaxy that maketh wise men doubt thus constellated in the depths of mars those rays described the venerable sign that quadrants joining in a circle make,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1590,87-121553-0056,here doth my memory overcome my genius for on that cross as levin gleamed forth christ so that i cannot find ensample worthy but he who takes his cross and follows christ again will pardon me what i omit seeing in that aurora lighten christ,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1591,87-121553-0057,so from the lights that there to me appeared upgathered through the cross a melody which rapt me not distinguishing the hymn well was i ware it was of lofty laud because there came to me arise and conquer as unto him who hears and comprehends not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1592,87-121553-0058,so much enamoured i became therewith that until then there was not anything that e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold postponing the delight of those fair eyes into which gazing my desire has rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1593,87-121553-0059,but who bethinks him that the living seals of every beauty grow in power ascending and that i there had not turned round to those can me excuse if i myself accuse to excuse myself and see that i speak truly for here the holy joy is not disclosed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1594,87-121553-0060,a will benign in which reveals itself ever the love that righteously inspires as in the iniquitous cupidity silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre and quieted the consecrated chords,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1595,87-121553-0061,that heaven's right hand doth tighten and relax how unto just entreaties shall be deaf those substances which to give me desire of praying them with one accord grew silent tis well that without end he should lament,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1596,87-121553-0062,who for the love of thing that doth not last eternally despoils him of that love as through the pure and tranquil evening air there shoots from time to time a sudden fire moving the eyes that steadfast were before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1597,87-121553-0063,and seems to be a star that changeth place except that in the part where it is kindled nothing is missed and this endureth little so from the horn that to the right extends unto that cross's foot there ran a star out of the constellation shining there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1598,87-121553-0064,so that fire seemed it behind alabaster thus piteous did anchises shade reach forward if any faith our greatest muse deserve when in elysium he his son perceived,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1599,87-121553-0065,then pleasant to the hearing and the sight the spirit joined to its beginning things i understood not so profound it spake nor did it hide itself from me by choice but by necessity for its conception above the mark of mortals set itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1600,87-121553-0066,and when the bow of burning sympathy was so far slackened that its speech descended towards the mark of our intelligence the first thing that was understood by me was benedight be thou o trine and one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1601,87-121553-0067,who hast unto my seed so courteous been and it continued hunger long and grateful drawn from the reading of the mighty volume wherein is never changed the white nor dark thou hast appeased my son within this light in which i speak to thee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1602,87-121553-0068,by grace of her who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass from him who is the first as from the unit if that be known ray out the five and six and therefore,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1789,1334-135589-0022,edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1790,1334-135589-0023,after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1791,1334-135589-0024,and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and every thing was ready for the restoration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1798,1334-135589-0031,it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles i'm sure it is them yes replied grenville,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1800,1334-135589-0033,for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1802,1334-135589-0035,although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1803,1334-135589-0036,alice and edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1804,1334-135589-0037,the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1805,1334-135589-0038,and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conynghame and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1806,1334-135589-0039,which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1807,1334-135589-0040,now edward who do you think was here to day the reigning belle and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1809,1334-135589-0042,i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1810,1334-135589-0043,with her to day when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1811,1334-135589-0044,and i understand is a very princely mansion humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mister heatherstone does it not replied edward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1812,1334-135589-0045,how can you say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1813,1334-135589-0046,what is your perplexity well replied edward since it is to be so let us sit down and talk over the matter i acknowledge the kindness of mister heatherstone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1814,1334-135589-0047,and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1815,1334-135589-0048,but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1816,1334-135589-0049,although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1817,1334-135589-0050,you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you in two said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you can not blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1818,1334-135589-0051,is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1819,1334-135589-0052,he can not refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his council will consider it advisable to make so many discontented,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1820,1334-135589-0053,which has been so long held by others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1821,1334-135589-0054,recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1822,1334-135589-0055,and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1823,1334-135589-0056,at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1824,1334-135589-0057,why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1825,1334-135589-0058,you were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey who has all along been acting as his factotum in the business and recollect at the time that mister heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1826,1334-135589-0059,what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1827,1334-135589-0060,and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstone's intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1828,1334-135589-0061,and now let me give you some advice for your friends masters chaloner and grenville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1829,1334-135589-0062,those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1830,1334-135589-0063,but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1831,1334-135589-0064,even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1832,1334-135589-0065,and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1833,1334-135589-0066,that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had dispatched a messenger with the letter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1834,1334-135589-0067,but the messenger had not yet returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1835,1334-135589-0068,on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1836,1334-135589-0069,and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1837,1334-135589-0070,mister heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1838,1334-135589-0071,edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1839,1334-135589-0072,but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1840,1334-135589-0073,there was the same pensive sweet expression in her face which had altered little but the beautiful rounded arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1841,1334-135589-0074,and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1842,1334-135589-0075,and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1843,1334-135589-0076,i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patience made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1844,1334-135589-0077,and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was enabled to go to his sisters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1845,1334-135589-0078,when he entered the room he found himself in the arms of humphrey who had arrived with the messenger after the greetings were over edward said alice and i have seen patience and i fear i must surrender at discretion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1846,1334-135589-0079,mister heatherstone may make his own terms i must wave all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i have seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1847,1334-135589-0080,let her father but give me her and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1848,1334-135589-0081,they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1849,1334-135589-0082,has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property he has indeed replied edward as for his daughter edward you have yet to win her and wear her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1850,1334-135589-0083,as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1851,1334-135589-0084,but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1852,1334-135589-0085,it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1853,1334-135589-0086,and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1854,1334-135589-0087,and it may be true replied edward mournfully well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1855,1334-135589-0088,you know humphrey how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1856,1334-135589-0089,to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argued upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1857,1334-135589-0090,replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1858,1334-135589-0091,after that speech sir the sooner you get back again the better retorted edith but edward made a sign to humphrey and they beat a retreat have you seen the intendant humphrey no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1859,1334-135589-0092,i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1860,1334-135589-0093,that will be explanation sufficient i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1861,1334-135589-0094,what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him your coming with me will make it appear so,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1862,1334-135589-0095,tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and edith wrong as regards his daughter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1863,1334-135589-0096,nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed passed my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mister heatherstone edward,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1864,1334-135589-0097,on mister heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1865,1334-135589-0098,patience colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1866,1334-135589-0099,then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fete at hampton court given in honor of three marriages taking place edward beverley to patience heatherstone chaloner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1867,1334-135589-0100,to alice and grenville to edith and as his majesty himself said as he gave away the brides could loyalty be better rewarded but our young readers will not be content if they do not hear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1868,1334-135589-0101,some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history humphrey must take the first place his love of farming continued edward gave him a large farm rent free,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1869,1334-135589-0102,and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself he then married clara ratcliffe who has not appeared lately on the scene owing to her having been about two years before the restoration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1870,1334-135589-0103,claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1871,1334-135589-0104,the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a houseful of young gipsies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1872,1334-135589-0105,oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1873,1334-135589-0106,in the capacity of housekeeper her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1874,5678-43303-0000,mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch and for a few days did her best but there was nothing that alarmed her the old lady was a little quiet perhaps but went about her minute affairs as usual she asked the girl to read to her sometimes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1875,5678-43303-0001,she packed his bag with her own hands set out his furs for the swift flight to paris and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction he would be gone three days he said it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1876,5678-43303-0002,and mabel running upstairs in alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair it is nothing my dear said the old lady tremulously and she added the description of a symptom or two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1877,5678-43303-0003,she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body the old lady was so tranquil and human,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1878,5678-43303-0004,so absorbed in small external matters so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth so utterly without resentment or peevishness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1879,5678-43303-0005,she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul for in that case she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1880,5678-43303-0006,her whole point so to speak lay in the delicate little fabric of personality built out of fragile things into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1881,5678-43303-0007,the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace it is syncope said the doctor when he came in she may die at any time she may live ten years there is no need to telegraph for mister brand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1882,5678-43303-0008,he made a little deprecating movement with his hands it is not certain that she will die it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1883,5678-43303-0009,she asked no no she may live ten years i said he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and went away the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1884,5678-43303-0010,well my dear she asked it is just a little weakness mother you must lie quiet and do nothing shall i read to you no my dear i will think a little it was no part of mabel's idea to duty to tell her that she was in danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1885,5678-43303-0011,for there was no past to set straight no judge to be confronted death was an ending not a beginning it was a peaceful gospel at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1886,5678-43303-0012,so the girl went downstairs once more with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still what a strange and beautiful thing death was she told herself this resolution of a chord that had hung suspended for thirty fifty or seventy years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1887,5678-43303-0013,back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself those same notes would be struck again were being struck again even now all over the world though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1888,5678-43303-0014,but that particular emotion was gone it was foolish to think that it was sounding eternally elsewhere for there was no elsewhere she too herself would cease one day let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1889,5678-43303-0015,mister phillips arrived the next morning as usual just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her she is a little better i think said mabel she must be very quiet all day the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1890,5678-43303-0016,where a heap of letters lay to be answered a couple of hours later as mabel went upstairs once more she met mister phillips coming down he looked a little flushed under his sallow skin missus brand sent for me he said she wished to know whether mister oliver would be back to night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1891,5678-43303-0017,he will will he not you have not heard mister brand said he would be here for a late dinner he will reach london at nineteen and is there any other news he compressed his lips there are rumours he said mister brand wired to me an hour ago,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1892,5678-43303-0018,he seemed moved at something and mabel looked at him in astonishment it is not eastern news she asked his eyebrows wrinkled a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1893,5678-43303-0019,she was not offended for she trusted her husband too well but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating the old lady too seemed excited she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks and hardly smiled at all to the girl's greeting,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1894,5678-43303-0020,said mabel old missus brand looked at her sharply an instant but said nothing don't excite yourself mother oliver will be back to night the old lady drew a long breath don't trouble about me my dear she said i shall do very well now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1895,5678-43303-0021,he will be back to dinner will he not if the volor is not late now mother are you ready for breakfast mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation it was certain that something had happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1896,5678-43303-0022,the secretary who breakfasted with her in the parlour looking on to the garden had appeared strangely excited he had told her that he would be away the rest of the day mister oliver had given him his instructions he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1897,5678-43303-0023,and he had given her no news of the paris convention he only repeated that mister oliver would be back that night then he had gone of in a hurry half an hour later the old lady seemed asleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1898,5678-43303-0024,neither did she like to leave the house so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing till the long shadow lay across the path and the tumbled platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1899,5678-43303-0025,as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would close that afternoon twenty o'clock came but there was no sign of oliver the paris volor should have arrived an hour before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1900,5678-43303-0026,but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1901,5678-43303-0027,of course she might have missed it there was no depending on its exact course but she had seen it a hundred times before and wondered unreasonably why she had not seen it now but she would not sit down to dinner and paced up and down in her white dress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1902,5678-43303-0028,turning again and again to the window listening to the soft rush of the trains the faint hoots from the track and the musical chords from the junction a mile away the lights were up by now and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairyland between the earthly light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1903,5678-43303-0029,and the heavenly darkness why did not oliver come or at least let her know why he did not once she went upstairs miserably anxious herself to reassure the old lady and found her again very drowsy he is not come she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1904,5678-43303-0030,i dare say he may be kept in paris the old face on the pillow nodded and murmured and mabel went down again it was now an hour after dinner time oh there were a hundred things that might have kept him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1906,5678-43303-0032,he might even have wired to mister phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it there it was that round silent month that little row of labelled buttons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1908,5678-43303-0034,oliver hated interference and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety then even as she turned away the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight whitehall she pressed the corresponding button and her hand shaking so much,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1913,5678-43301-0000,in his masonic insignia it was he who had given immense impetus to that secret movement by his declaration in the house that the key of future progress and brotherhood of nations was in the hands of the order,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1914,5678-43301-0001,it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted saint paul had been right he declared in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1915,5678-43301-0002,and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ thus he had preluded his speech on the poor law question pointing to the true charity that existed among masons apart from religious motive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1916,5678-43301-0003,and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesman appeared to be one of the speakers though at a slightly higher elevation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1917,5678-43301-0004,and this platform was hung with roses surmounted by a sounding board and set with a chair and table the whole square round about was paved with heads and resonant with sound the murmurs of thousands of voices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1918,5678-43301-0005,overpowered now and again by the crash of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds each headed by a banner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1919,5678-43301-0006,and converged towards the wide railed space about the platform where room was reserved for them the windows on every side were packed with faces tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and saint martin's church,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1920,5678-43301-0007,garden beds of colour behind the mute white statues that faced outwards round the square from braithwaite in front past the victorians john davidson john burns and the rest round to hampden and de montfort towards the north,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1921,5678-43301-0008,the old column was gone with its lions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1922,5678-43301-0009,nor the lions to the new art and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery overhead the roofs showed crowded friezes of heads against the blue summer sky,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1923,5678-43301-0010,not less than one hundred thousand persons it was estimated in the evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon as the clocks began to tell the hour two figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward and in an instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1924,5678-43301-0011,the murmurs of talk rose into cheering old lord pemberton came first a grey haired upright man whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over seventy years ago and his son had succeeded him worthily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1925,5678-43301-0012,and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion behind him came oliver bareheaded and spruce and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1926,5678-43301-0013,there was no doubt that these londoners could sing it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody rising to enthusiasm till the music of massed bands followed it as a flag follows a flag stick the hymn was one composed ten years before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1927,5678-43301-0014,and all england was familiar with it old missus bland lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes and saw the words that she knew so well the lord that dwells in earth and sea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1928,5678-43301-0015,had been composed with both skill and ardour they had a religious ring the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm yet their sense was plain enough the old human creed that man was all even christ's words themselves were quoted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1929,5678-43301-0016,the kingdom of god it was said lay within the human heart and the greatest of all graces was charity she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure a hundred yards away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1930,5678-43301-0017,and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or two across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him then he stepped back and oliver came forward it was too far for the two to hear what was said but mabel slipped a paper smiling tremulously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1931,5678-43301-0018,into the old lady's hand and herself bent forward to listen old missus brand looked at that too knowing that it was an analysis of her son's speech and aware that she would not be able to hear his words,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1932,5678-43301-0019,of this great anniversary then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present fifty years ago the speaker said poverty was still a disgrace now it was so no longer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1933,5678-43301-0020,it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay who would not honour a man worn out in the service of his country or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1934,5678-43301-0021,he enumerated the reforms passed fifty years before on this very day by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1935,5678-43301-0022,and its reward and that he supposed together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws would form the first half of his speech the second part was to be a panegyric of braithwaite treating him as the precursor of a movement that even now had begun,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1936,5678-43301-0023,old missus brand leaned back in her seat and looked about her the window where they sat had been reserved for them two arm chairs filled the space but immediately behind there were others standing very silent now craning forward watching too with parted lips,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1937,5678-43301-0024,a couple of women with an old man directly behind and other faces visible again behind them their obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction and she turned resolutely once more to the square ah he was working up now to his panegyric,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1938,5678-43301-0025,the tiny dark figure was back a yard nearer the statue and as she looked his hand went up and he wheeled pointing as a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice then again he was forward half crouching for he was a born actor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1939,5678-43301-0026,and a storm of laughter rippled round the throng of heads she heard an indrawn hiss behind her chair and the next instant an exclamation from mabel what was that there was a sharp crack and the tiny gesticulating figure staggered back a step,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1940,5678-43301-0027,the old man at the table was up in a moment and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were massed and directly opposite the front of the platform,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1941,5678-43302-0000,oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home leaning back in his chair with one arm bandaged and in a sling they had not been able to get near him at the time the excitement in the square had been too fierce,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1942,5678-43302-0001,but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors he was a catholic explained the drawn faced oliver he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1943,5678-43302-0002,well there was no chance for a priest this time mabel nodded slowly she had read of the man's fate on the placards he was killed trampled and strangled instantly said oliver i did what i could you saw me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1944,5678-43302-0003,but well i dare say it was more merciful but you did what you could my dear said the old lady anxiously from her corner i called out to them mother but they wouldn't hear me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1945,5678-43302-0004,mabel leaned forward oliver i know this sounds stupid of me but but i wish they had not killed him oliver smiled at her he knew this tender trait in her it would have been more perfect if they had not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1946,5678-43302-0005,she said then she broke off and sat back why did he shoot just then she asked oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother but she was knitting tranquilly then he answered with a curious deliberateness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1947,5678-43302-0006,i said that braithwaite had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second then they went on again as before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1948,5678-43302-0007,but he must have meant to do it anyhow continued oliver how do they know he was a catholic asked the girl again there was a rosary on him and then he just had time to call on his god and nothing more is known,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1949,5678-43302-0008,nothing more he was well dressed though oliver leaned back a little wearily and closed his eyes his arm still throbbed intolerably but he was very happy at heart it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1950,5678-43302-0009,but he was not sorry to bear pain in such a cause and it was obvious that the sympathy of england was with him mister phillips even now was busy in the next room answering the telegrams that poured in every moment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1951,5678-43302-0010,caldecott the prime minister maxwell snowford and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations and from every part of england streamed in message after message it was an immense stroke for the communists,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1952,5678-43302-0011,speaking in defence of his principles it was an incalculable gain for them and loss for the individualists that confessors were not all on one side after all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1953,5678-43302-0012,the huge electric placards over london had winked out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight oliver brand wounded catholic assailant indignation of the country,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1954,5678-43302-0013,well deserved fate of assassin he was pleased too that he honestly had done his best to save the man even in that moment of sudden and acute pain he had cried out for a fair trial but he had been too late,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1955,5678-43302-0014,he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and torn at his throat then the face had vanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared oh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1956,5678-43302-0015,there was some passion and loyalty left in england his mother got up presently and went out still without a word and mabel turned to him laying a hand on his knee are you too tired to talk my dear he opened his eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1957,5678-43302-0016,of course not my darling what is it what do you think will be the effect he raised himself a little looking out as usual through the darkening windows on to that astonishing view,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1958,5678-43302-0017,everywhere now lights were glowing a sea of mellow moons just above the houses and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening the effect he said it can be nothing but good it was time that something happened,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1959,5678-43302-0018,my dear i feel very downcast sometimes as you know well i do not think i shall be again i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit and that the old tories were partly right when they prophesied what communism would do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1961,5678-43302-0020,and so dramatic the poor devil could not have chosen a worse moment people won't forget it mabel's eyes shone with pleasure you poor dear she said are you in pain not much besides christ,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1965,5678-43302-0024,but she could see what she loved to see that response to her own heart and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1967,5678-43302-0026,mabel do you think she is falling back oh she is getting old said the girl lightly of course she looks back a little but you don't think it would be too awful she shook her head no,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1968,5678-43302-0027,no my dear you're excited and tired it's just a little sentiment oliver i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her but she hears it everywhere now no she doesn't remember,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1969,5678-43302-0028,she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years well watch her won't you by the way yes there's a little more news from the east they say felsenburgh's running the whole thing now the empire is sending him everywhere,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

1972,5678-43302-0031,tell me some more there is no more but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis if the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now it will never be likely to raise it again it will mean free trade all over the world i suppose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1973,5678-43302-0032,and all that kind of thing but if not well if not there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1974,5678-43302-0033,these new benninschein explosives will make certain of that but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them absolutely benninschein sold them simultaneously to east and west then he died luckily for him mabel had heard this kind of talk before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1975,5678-43302-0034,but her imagination simply refused to grasp it a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing there had been no european war within living memory and the eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1976,5678-43302-0035,now if tales were true entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell the new conditions were unimaginable military experts prophesied extravagantly contradicting one another on vital points,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1977,5678-43302-0036,the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory there were no precedents with which to compare it it was as if archers disputed as to the results of cordite only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine and as regards male population,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1978,5678-43302-0037,half as much again as the rest of the world put together and the conclusion to be drawn from these premisses was not reassuring to england but imagination simply refused to speak the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1979,5678-43302-0038,founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world felsenburgh's name appeared more frequently than ever otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush nothing suffered very much trade went on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1980,5678-43302-0039,european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual men still built houses married wives begat sons and daughters did their business and went to the theatre for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else they could neither save nor precipitate the situation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1981,5678-43302-0040,it was on too large a scale occasionally people went mad people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness but that was all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1982,8975-270782-0000,thirteenth lecture the dream archaic remnants and infantilism in the dream let us revert to our conclusion that the dream work under the influence of the dream censorship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1983,8975-270782-0001,transforms the latent dream thoughts into some other form of expression the latent thoughts are no other than the conscious thoughts known to us in our waking hours the new mode of expression is incomprehensible to us because of its many sided features,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1984,8975-270782-0002,so we called the mode of expression of the dream work the archaic or regressive you may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dream work we gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our intellectual development i trust this will be true,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1985,8975-270782-0003,but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken the antiquity into which the dream work carries us back is of a double aspect firstly the individual antiquity childhood and secondly in so far as every individual in his childhood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1986,8975-270782-0004,that we shall be able to differentiate which part of the latent psychic proceeding has its source in the individual,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1987,8975-270782-0005,in this connection it appears to me for example that the symbolic relations which the individual has never learned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1988,8975-270782-0006,however this is not the only archaic characteristic of the dream you probably all know from your own experiences the peculiar amnesia that is loss of memory concerning childhood i mean the fact that the first years to the fifth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1989,8975-270782-0007,that of a gap in the memory is far more frequent i believe we have not laid enough stress on this fact the child is able to speak well at the age of two it soon shows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic situations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1990,8975-270782-0008,and makes remarks which years later are retold to it but which it has itself entirely forgotten besides the memory in the early years is more facile because it is less burdened than in later years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1991,8975-270782-0009,nor is there any reason for considering the memory function as a particularly high or difficult psychic performance in fact the contrary is true and you can find a good memory in persons who stand very low intellectually,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1992,8975-270782-0010,i must point out that certain well preserved memories for the most part formatively experienced stand forth in this memory void which surrounds the first years of childhood and do not justify this hypothesis,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1993,8975-270782-0011,our memory deals selectively with its later materials with impressions which come to us in later life it retains the important and discards the unimportant this is not true of the retained childhood memories,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1994,8975-270782-0012,they do not bespeak necessarily important experiences of childhood not even such as from the viewpoint of the child need appear of importance they are often so banal and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves in wonder why just these details,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1995,8975-270782-0013,have escaped being forgotten i once endeavored to approach the riddle of childhood amnesia and the interrupted memory remnants with the help of analysis and i arrived at the conclusion that in the case of the child too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1996,8975-270782-0014,by means of careful analysis one is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1997,8975-270782-0015,and in so far as the cure is to any degree successful we are able again to bring to light the content of the childhood years thus clouded in forgetfulness these impressions have never really been forgotten they have only been inaccessible latent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1998,8975-270782-0016,have belonged to the unconscious but sometimes they bob up out of the unconscious spontaneously and as a matter of fact this is what happens in dreams it is apparent that the dream life knows how to find the entrance to these latent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
1999,8975-270782-0017,beautiful examples of this occur in literature and i myself can present such an example i once dreamed in a certain connection of a person who must have performed some service for me and whom i clearly saw he was a one eyed man short in stature stout,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2000,8975-270782-0018,his head deeply sunk into his neck i concluded from the content that he was a physician luckily i was able to ask my mother who was still living how the physician in my birth place which i left when i was three years old looked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2001,8975-270782-0019,and i learned from her that he had one eye was short and stout with his head sunk into his neck and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me this control over the forgotten material of childhood years,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2002,8975-270782-0020,is then a further archaic tendency of the dream the same information may be made use of in another of the puzzles that have presented themselves to us you will recall how astonished people were,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2003,8975-270782-0021,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2004,8975-270782-0022,in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asks the question whence such a wish comes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2005,8975-270782-0023,we need not hesitate to point out this origin these evil wish impulses have their origin in the past often in a past which is not too far away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2006,8975-270782-0024,the woman whose dream is interpreted to mean that she would like to see her seventeen year old daughter dead discovers under our guidance that she in fact at one time entertained this wish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2007,8975-270782-0025,which early ended in a separation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2008,8975-270782-0026,she beat her body with her fists in a fit of anger in order to kill the child how many mothers who to day love their children tenderly perhaps too tenderly received them unwillingly and at the time wished that the life within them would not develop further,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2009,8975-270782-0027,indeed translated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some loved one which seems so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2010,8975-270782-0028,this wish was no stranger to him while the child was still a suckling this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2011,8975-270782-0029,that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2012,8975-270782-0030,only wish to warn you that you are to take into consideration not the exact terms of the dream but the meaning thereof according to its interpretation it may happen that the manifest dream of the death of some loved person has only made use of some frightful mask,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2013,8975-270782-0031,that it really means something entirely different or that the loved person serves as a concealing substitute for some other but the same circumstances will call forth another more difficult question you say granted this death wish was present at some time or other,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2014,8975-270782-0032,and is substantiated by memory yet this is no explanation it is long outlived to day it can be present only in the unconscious and as an empty emotionless memory but not as a strong impulse why should it be recalled by the dream at all this question is justified,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2015,8975-270782-0033,in one of the most important points of dream study but i must remain within the bounds of our discussion and practice restraint prepare yourselves for the temporary abstention let us be satisfied with the circumstantial proof,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2016,8975-270782-0034,that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past let us continue with the removal or death wish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2017,8975-270782-0035,which most frequently can be traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2018,8975-270782-0036,as often as someone has been in our way in life and how often must this happen in the complicated relationships of life the dream is ready to do away with him be he father mother brother sister spouse et cetera,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2019,8975-270782-0037,we have wondered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature and certainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2020,8975-270782-0038,or real remnants thereof show themselves for the child loves itself first and later learns to love others to sacrifice something of its ego for another,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2021,8975-270782-0039,even those persons whom the child seems to love from the very beginning it loves at the outset because it has need of them cannot do without them in others words out of egoistical motives,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2024,8975-270782-0042,often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling or rather let us say glossed over but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier it is most noticeable in children of from two and one half,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2027,8975-270782-0045,if the difference in age is less the child learns of the existence of the rival with intense psychic activity and accommodates himself to the new situation if the difference in age is greater the new child may awaken certain sympathies as an,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2031,8975-270782-0049,if there is anyone who hates a young english lady more than does her mother it is her elder sister there is something about this saying however that arouses our antipathy we can at a pinch understand hatred of brothers and sisters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2032,8975-270782-0050,and rivalry among them but how may feelings of hatred force their way into the relationship between daughter and mother parents and children this relationship is without doubt the more favorable even when looked at from the viewpoint of the child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2037,8975-270782-0055,the abstention from sexual liberty which society demands in certain cases also she is the rival who objects to being displaced the same type of thing occurs in a more glaring manner between father and son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2040,8975-270782-0058,the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistical considerations why do i speak of these things so banal and so well known,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2041,8975-270782-0059,because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny their significance in life and to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing much oftener than it really is fulfilled but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2042,8975-270782-0060,rather than that this task should be left to the cynic in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2043,8975-270782-0061,it is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people the dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents especially the parent of the same sex we may conclude that it is also present during waking hours,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2044,8975-270782-0062,as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example three it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2045,8975-270782-0063,by which it is suppressed and must wait until a dream isolates it that which the dream shows us in enlarged form as a result of such isolation shrinks together again after it has been properly docketed in its relation to life as a result of our interpretation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2046,8975-270782-0064,h sachs but we also find this dream wish in places where it has no connection with life and where the adult in his waking hours would never recognize it the reason for this is that the deepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2047,8975-270782-0065,especially between persons of the same sex has already made its influence felt in earliest childhood i mean the love rivalry with the especial emphasis of the sex character the son even as a small child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2048,8975-270782-0066,who is a disturbing element in her tender relationship with her father and who occupies a position that she could very well fill herself one learns from these observations to what early years these ideas extend back,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2049,8975-270782-0067,ideas which we designate as the oedipus complex because this myth realizes with a very slightly weakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the son to kill his father and take his mother to wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2050,8975-270782-0068,i do not wish to maintain that the oedipus complex covers entirely the relation of the child to its parents this relation can be much more complicated furthermore the oedipus complex is more or less well developed it may even experience a reversal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2051,8975-270782-0069,but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child and one tends rather to underestimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments which may follow from it in addition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2052,8975-270782-0070,children frequently react to the oedipus idea through stimulation by the parents who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences so that the father prefers the daughter the mother the son,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2053,8975-270782-0071,and this love is substituted for the outworn love one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the oedipus complex on the contrary it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2054,8975-270782-0072,and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this proscribed or tabooed feeling relationship later made good the omission by taking all value from the complex through false interpretations according to my unchanged conviction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2055,8975-270782-0073,cast out of life was yielded up to poetry and given the freest play o rank has shown in a careful study how this very oedipus complex has supplied dramatic literature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2056,8975-270782-0074,with a large number of motives in unending variations derivations and disguises also in distorted forms such as we recognize to be the work of a censor we may also ascribe this oedipus complex to those dreamers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2057,8975-270782-0075,who were so fortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents and intimately associated therewith we find what we call the castration complex the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2058,8975-270782-0076,by applying our former researches to the study of the psychic life of the child we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden dream wishes of excessive sexual impulses may be explained in the same manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2059,8975-270782-0077,thus we are moved to study the development of sex life in the child also and we discover the following from a number of sources in the first place it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual life and to take it for granted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2060,8975-270782-0078,that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2061,8975-270782-0079,what we call perverse in the life of the adult differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the gulf between man and animal second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2063,8975-270782-0081,he knows no unbridgable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he is not disgusted at the sight of excrement but slowly learns to be so disgusted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2064,8975-270782-0082,under the pressure of education he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes rather accredits to both the same genital formation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2065,8975-270782-0083,toward those persons closest to him and who are dear to him for various reasons his parents brothers and sisters nurses and finally you may observe in him that which later breaks through again raised now to a love attraction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2066,8975-270782-0084,polymorphus perverse and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses it is on the one hand because of their lesser intensity as compared to later life and on the other hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2067,8975-270782-0085,and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2068,8975-270782-0086,and then at the writing table defend the sexual purity of the same children where children are left to themselves or are under the influence of corruption,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2069,8975-270782-0087,of perverse sexual activity to be sure the grown ups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances as play for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of custom or before the law,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2070,8975-270782-0088,but these things do exist they have their significance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and furtherances of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2071,8975-270782-0089,when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2072,8975-270782-0090,those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what antipathy society feels toward such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2073,8975-270782-0091,the most monstrous efforts have been made to explain this fear of incest some have believed that it is due to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature which is psychically represented by this prohibition because inbreeding would deteriorate the race character,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2074,8975-270782-0092,others maintained that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the persons under consideration in both cases furthermore the incest avoidance would be automatically assured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2075,8975-270782-0093,and most customary choice and that not until later is there any resistance the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2076,8975-270782-0094,toward the understanding of the dream we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2078,8975-270782-0096,infantile side of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions partly because it is lightly considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2079,8975-270782-0097,since the dream regresses to this stage it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us but it is only a deceptive appearance by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2080,8975-270782-0098,if the evil impulses of the dream are merely infantilism a return to the beginnings of our ethical development since the dream simply makes children of us again in thinking and in feeling we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2081,8975-270782-0099,but being reasonable is only a part of psychic life many things are taking place there that are not reasonable and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams and unreasonably we turn them over to the dream censorship,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2082,8975-270782-0100,are ashamed and angry if one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2083,8975-270782-0101,as we would be if we understood it just think of the scandalized opinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of services of love the problem is not yet solved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2084,8975-270782-0102,and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2085,8975-270782-0103,which however disclose only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dream work is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2086,8975-270782-0104,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even our old intellectual property,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2087,8975-270782-0105,unconscious is no longer a name for what is at that time latent the unconscious is an especial psychic realm with wish impulses of its own with its own method of expression and with a psychic mechanism peculiar to itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2088,8975-270782-0106,but the latent dream thoughts which we have solved by means of the dream interpretation are not of this realm they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours still they are unconscious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2089,8975-270782-0107,how does one solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that shares its characteristics,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2090,8975-270782-0108,the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2091,8975-270782-0109,between these two parts the dream work completes itself the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious necessitates regression this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2092,8975-270782-0110,that we are able to attain without having searched through further psychic realms the time will soon come however when we shall clothe the unconscious character of the latent dream thought with another name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2093,8975-270782-0111,which shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we may to be sure propound the question what forces the psychological activity during sleep to such regression,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2094,8975-270782-0112,why do not the sleep disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it and if they must because of the dream censorship disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2095,8975-270782-0113,what is the use of giving new life to old long outgrown psychic stimuli wishes and character types that is why the material regression in addition to the formal the only satisfactory answer would be this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2096,8975-270782-0114,that only in this manner can a dream be built up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2098,1502-122619-0001,could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2099,1502-122619-0002,though they had seen fit with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of their ally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2100,1502-122619-0003,in various ways it was the prevalent opinion however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2101,1502-122619-0004,that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2102,1502-122619-0005,that their hatchets were dull and time was necessary to sharpen them the politic captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2103,1502-122619-0006,on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2104,1502-122619-0007,the women ran from lodge to lodge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2105,1502-122619-0008,a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends the warriors were lounging in groups,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2106,1502-122619-0009,the instruments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges but none departed here and there a warrior was examining his arms with an attention that is rarely bestowed on the implements,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2107,1502-122619-0010,when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2108,1502-122619-0011,as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2109,1502-122619-0012,he was without arms and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance when in full view of the delawares he stopped and made a gesture of amity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2110,1502-122619-0013,by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall impressively on his breast,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2111,1502-122619-0014,fortified by these assurances the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2112,1502-122619-0015,he made as he advanced many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice the women however like one who deemed their favor in the present enterprise of no importance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2113,1502-122619-0016,his reception was grave silent and wary the warriors in front stepped aside opening the way to their most approved orator by the action,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2114,1502-122619-0017,one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines the wise huron is welcome said the delaware,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2116,1502-122619-0019,he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist they once more exchanged friendly salutations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2117,1502-122619-0020,then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge and share his morning meal the invitation was accepted and the two warriors attended by three or four of the old men walked calmly away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2118,1502-122619-0021,leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short and frugal repast that followed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2119,1502-122619-0022,and related entirely to the events of the hunt in which magua had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2121,1502-122619-0024,is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2122,1502-122619-0025,when was it ever otherwise returned magua he calls my people most beloved the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2123,1502-122619-0026,the tomahawks of your young men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yengeese are dead and the delawares are our neighbors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2124,1502-122619-0027,the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand and remained silent then magua as if recalled to such a recollection by the allusion to the massacre demanded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2125,1502-122619-0028,does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open let her be sent to my squaws if she gives trouble to my brother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2126,1502-122619-0029,she is welcome returned the chief of the latter nation still more emphatically the baffled magua continued silent several minutes apparently indifferent however to the repulse he had received,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2127,1502-122619-0030,in this his opening effort to regain possession of cora do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their hunts he at length continued,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2128,1502-122619-0031,it is well justice is the master of a red skin why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2129,1502-122619-0032,good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2130,1502-122619-0033,to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares before he added have there not been strange moccasins in the woods have not my brothers scented the feet of white men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2131,1502-122619-0034,let my canada father come returned the other evasively his children are ready to see him when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams the hurons say too he is welcome,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2132,1502-122619-0035,but the yengeese have long arms and legs that never tire,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2133,1502-122619-0036,it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said magua once more shifting his ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2134,1502-122619-0037,and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2135,1502-122619-0038,in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors one of whom was his host he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2136,1502-122619-0039,compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2137,1502-122619-0040,so aptly mingled with praise in the eyes of those he addressed this well judged and politic stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2138,1502-122619-0041,my brother is a wise chief he is welcome the hurons love their friends the delawares returned magua why should they not they are colored by the same sun and their just men will hunt in the same grounds after death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2139,1502-122619-0042,the red skins should be friends and look with open eyes on the white men has not my brother scented spies in the woods the delaware whose name in english signified hard heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2140,1502-122619-0043,an appellation that the french had translated into le coeur dur forgot that obduracy of purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2141,1502-122619-0044,would the yengeese send their women as spies did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle he told no lie the yengeese have sent out their scouts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2142,1502-122619-0045,then they fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends their minds are turned from their canada father this insinuation was a home thrust,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2143,1502-122619-0046,would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist the recent defection of the tribe had as they well knew themselves subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2144,1502-122619-0047,and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2153,1502-122619-0056,a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2154,1502-122619-0057,the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated the women suspended their labors to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2155,1502-122619-0058,the boys deserted their sports and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the temerity of their hated foe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2165,1502-122619-0068,the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2169,1502-122619-0072,on the present occasion the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak was silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2173,1502-122619-0076,the elastic light step of an indian was gone and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2174,1502-122619-0077,his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2178,1502-122619-0081,he also wore armlets and cinctures above the ankles of the latter precious metal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2179,1502-122619-0082,in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks his tomahawk was nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2180,1502-122619-0083,which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2182,1502-122619-0085,with the great spirit and which has since transmitted his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his ancient territory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2183,1502-122619-0086,the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out a little from the throng,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2184,1502-122619-0087,whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2186,1502-122619-0089,the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2188,1502-122619-0091,who belongs rather to another world than to this was received by his people after a suitable and decent pause,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2189,1502-122619-0092,and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2190,1502-122619-0093,so just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2191,1502-122619-0094,the chiefs drew back again to their several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2192,1502-122619-0095,arose left the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2193,1502-122619-0096,escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment the crowd opened in a lane and when the party had re entered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2194,1502-122615-0000,pope's iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear the hurons are dogs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2195,1502-122615-0001,the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior tremble the gray head and the sagamore are safe,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2197,1502-122615-0003,but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2198,1502-122615-0004,the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the lodge and exhibited the figure of uncas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2199,1502-122615-0005,after this termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2200,1502-122615-0006,he retraced his steps to the council lodge resolved to seek and question david in order to put an end to his doubts on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2201,1502-122615-0007,though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far the terrible scene that had just occurred,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2202,1502-122615-0008,proved favorable to his views and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage without seeming to hesitate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2203,1502-122615-0009,he walked into the lodge and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that though uncas still remained where he had left him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2204,1502-122615-0010,david had not reappeared no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2205,1502-122615-0011,in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2206,1502-122615-0012,he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent resolution his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2207,1502-122615-0013,he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him my canada father does not forget his children said the chief,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2209,1502-122615-0015,in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2214,1502-122615-0020,he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2228,1502-122615-0034,standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as if sickening at the gaze of men and veiling his face in his blanket he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2234,103-1241-0001,or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2235,103-1241-0002,matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2236,103-1241-0003,he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2237,103-1241-0004,and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2238,103-1241-0005,he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2239,103-1241-0006,matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2240,103-1241-0007,and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2241,103-1241-0008,the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2242,103-1241-0009,she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2243,103-1241-0010,guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2244,103-1241-0011,i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2245,103-1241-0012,maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2246,103-1241-0013,and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2247,103-1241-0014,a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2248,103-1241-0015,her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2249,103-1241-0016,might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2250,103-1241-0017,was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2251,103-1241-0018,i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2252,103-1241-0019,i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2253,103-1241-0020,i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2254,103-1241-0021,matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2255,103-1241-0022,no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2256,103-1241-0023,it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2257,103-1241-0024,we've got to drive a long piece haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2258,103-1241-0025,it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2259,103-1241-0026,they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2260,103-1241-0027,who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2261,103-1241-0028,i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2262,103-1241-0029,the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2263,103-1241-0030,isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2264,103-1241-0031,i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2265,103-1241-0032,but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2266,103-1241-0033,i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2267,103-1241-0034,but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2268,103-1241-0035,and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2269,103-1241-0036,she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2270,103-1241-0037,oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2271,103-1241-0038,and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2272,103-1241-0039,and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2273,103-1241-0040,there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2274,103-1241-0041,was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2275,103-1241-0042,he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2276,103-1241-0043,and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2277,103-1240-0000,chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2278,103-1240-0001,that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2279,103-1240-0002,for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2280,103-1240-0003,and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2281,103-1240-0004,but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2282,103-1240-0005,helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2283,103-1240-0006,as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2284,103-1240-0007,anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2285,103-1240-0008,the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2286,103-1240-0009,missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2287,103-1240-0010,peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2288,103-1240-0011,and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2289,103-1240-0012,had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2290,103-1240-0013,he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often missus rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2291,103-1240-0014,and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2292,103-1240-0015,if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2293,103-1240-0016,yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2294,103-1240-0017,the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2295,103-1240-0018,had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2296,103-1240-0019,barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2297,103-1240-0020,bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2298,103-1240-0021,they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2299,103-1240-0022,set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2300,103-1240-0023,one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2301,103-1240-0024,or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2302,103-1240-0025,whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2303,103-1240-0026,and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2304,103-1240-0027,there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2305,103-1240-0028,yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2306,103-1240-0029,how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2307,103-1240-0030,thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2308,103-1240-0031,but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctor's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2309,103-1240-0032,marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2310,103-1240-0033,matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2311,103-1240-0034,she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2312,103-1240-0035,said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2313,103-1240-0036,marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2314,103-1240-0037,what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2315,103-1240-0038,missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2316,103-1240-0039,so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2317,103-1240-0040,there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2318,103-1240-0041,they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2319,103-1240-0042,so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2320,103-1240-0043,old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2321,103-1240-0044,so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2322,103-1240-0045,well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2323,103-1240-0046,nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2324,103-1240-0047,and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2325,103-1240-0048,this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2326,103-1240-0049,it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2327,103-1240-0050,and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2328,103-1240-0051,only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2329,103-1240-0052,as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2330,103-1240-0053,missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2331,103-1240-0054,and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2332,103-1240-0055,it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2333,103-1240-0056,it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2334,103-1240-0057,my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2335,311-124404-0000,i would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which i deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2336,311-124404-0001,i believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truths are that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2337,311-124404-0002,i have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which i have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of god and of the soul,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2338,311-124404-0003,and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had formerly appeared and yet i venture to state that not only have i found means,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2339,311-124404-0004,to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2340,311-124404-0005,and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2341,311-124404-0006,but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2342,311-124404-0007,fearing lest i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind i resolved to expound singly though at considerable length my opinions regarding light then,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2343,311-124404-0008,to take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed stars since light almost wholly proceeds from them on the heavens since they transmit it on the planets comets and earth since they reflect it and particularly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2344,311-124404-0009,on all the bodies that are upon the earth since they are either colored or transparent or luminous and finally on man since he is the spectator of these objects,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2345,311-124404-0010,further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2346,311-124404-0011,i resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2347,311-124404-0012,matter sufficient to compose one and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2348,311-124404-0013,and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established on this supposition i in the first place described this matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2349,311-124404-0014,and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2350,311-124404-0015,for i even expressly supposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are so debated in the schools nor in general anything the knowledge of which is not so natural to our minds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2351,311-124404-0016,i endeavored to demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2352,311-124404-0017,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2353,311-124404-0018,as to present the appearance of heavens how in the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets and others a sun and fixed stars and making a digression at this stage on the subject of light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2354,311-124404-0019,i expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2355,311-124404-0020,and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth to this i likewise added much respecting the substance the situation the motions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2356,311-124404-0021,and all the different qualities of these heavens and stars so that i thought i had said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in the heavens or stars of our system that must not or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which i described,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2357,311-124404-0022,i came next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i had expressly supposed that god had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2358,311-124404-0023,to that observed in our seas as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such as is likewise observed between the tropics how the mountains seas fountains and rivers might naturally be formed in it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2359,311-124404-0024,and the metals produced in the mines and the plants grow in the fields and in general how all the bodies which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and among other things in the discoveries alluded to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2360,311-124404-0025,i knew nothing except fire which produces light i spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature the manner of its production and support and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light and light without heat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2361,311-124404-0026,to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others how it can consume almost all bodies or convert them into ashes and smoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2362,311-124404-0027,and finally how from these ashes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2363,311-124404-0028,for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature i took a special pleasure in describing it i was not however disposed from these circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2364,311-124404-0029,to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2365,311-124404-0030,but this is certain and an opinion commonly received among theologians that the action by which he now sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2366,311-124404-0031,so that even although he had from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos provided only he had established certain laws of nature and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2367,311-124404-0032,it may be believed without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone things purely material might in course of time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2368,311-124404-0033,from the description of inanimate bodies and plants i passed to animals and particularly to man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2369,311-124404-0034,but since i had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the rest that is to say by deducing effects from their causes and by showing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2370,311-124404-0035,nature must produce them i remained satisfied with the supposition that god formed the body of man wholly like to one of ours as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2371,311-124404-0036,of the same matter with that i had described and at first placed in it no rational soul nor any other principle in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2372,311-124404-0037,and which i thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit for when i examined the kind of functions which might,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2373,311-124404-0038,as consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2374,311-124404-0039,consists in thinking functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us but among which i could not discover any of those that as dependent on thought alone belong to us as men,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2375,311-124404-0040,while on the other hand i did afterwards discover these as soon as i supposed god to have created a rational soul and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which i described,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2376,311-124404-0041,will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2377,311-124404-0042,to take the trouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large animal possessed of lungs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2378,311-124404-0043,and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tubes viz the hollow vein vena cava,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2379,311-124404-0044,which is the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately so denominated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2380,311-124404-0045,presently disperse themselves all over the lungs in the second place the cavity in the left side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2381,311-124404-0046,two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2382,311-124404-0047,where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein and those of the tube called the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issuing from the heart sends its branches all over the body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2383,311-124404-0048,i should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the eleven pellicles which like so many small valves open and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities viz,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2384,311-124404-0049,three at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out three at the entrance to the arterial vein,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2385,311-124404-0050,which arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former readily permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity and in like manner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2386,311-124404-0051,two others at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but preclude its return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2387,311-124404-0052,but prevent its reflux nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation can be adequately closed with two,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2388,311-124404-0053,whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2389,311-124404-0054,and there form as it were two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2390,311-124404-0055,and finally that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2391,311-124404-0056,for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2392,311-124404-0057,into these the blood of necessity flows from the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these two vessels are always full of blood and their orifices which are turned towards the heart cannot then be closed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2393,311-124404-0058,because the orifices through which they pass are wide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2394,311-124404-0059,are immediately rarefied and dilated by the heat they meet with in this way they cause the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2395,311-124404-0060,of the two vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels through which they pass out,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2396,311-124404-0061,causing in this way all the branches of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract as do also the arteries,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2397,311-124404-0062,and the six small valves close and the five of the hollow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2398,311-124404-0063,venous artery open anew and allow a passage,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2399,311-124404-0064,which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before and because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2400,311-124404-0065,it thence happens that their motion is the contrary of that of the heart and that when it expands they contract but lest those who are ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2401,311-124404-0066,true reasons from mere verisimilitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2402,311-124404-0067,from the very arrangement of the parts which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience as does the motion of a clock from the power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2403,311-124404-0068,the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2404,311-124404-0069,and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2405,311-124404-0070,so that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation of this we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons who by binding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where they open the vein,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2406,311-124404-0071,cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature whereas quite the contrary would happen were they to bind it below that is between the hand and the opening or were to make the ligature above,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2407,311-124404-0072,the opening very tight for it is manifest that the tie moderately straightened while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins cannot on that account prevent new blood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2408,311-124404-0073,from coming forward through the arteries because these are situated below the veins and their coverings from their greater consistency are more difficult to compress and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2409,311-124404-0074,to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins there must of necessity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2410,311-124404-0075,which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2411,311-124404-0076,so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there are many other circumstances which evince that what i have alleged,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2412,311-124404-0077,is the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins and that from the arteries can only arise from this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2413,311-124404-0078,and more vivid and warmer immediately after leaving the heart in other words when in the arteries than it was a short time before passing into either in other words when it was in the veins,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2414,311-124404-0079,and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2415,311-124404-0080,in parts more remote from it in the next place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2416,311-124404-0081,sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins and why should the left cavity of the heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2417,311-124404-0082,and the arterial vein were it not that the blood of the venous artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and rarefies more readily and in a higher degree,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2418,311-124404-0083,whence it happens that if the blood be withdrawn from any part the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means and although the heart were as hot as glowing iron it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2419,311-124404-0084,and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2420,311-124404-0085,when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times in a day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2421,311-124404-0086,and the production of the different humors of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being rarefied passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2422,311-124404-0087,and there occupy the place of some others expelled by them and that according to the situation shape or smallness of the pores with which they meet some rather than others flow into certain parts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2423,311-124404-0088,which by being variously perforated serve to separate different species of grain and in the last place what above all is here worthy of observation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2424,311-124404-0089,is the generation of the animal spirits which are like a very subtle wind or rather a very pure and vivid flame which,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2425,311-124404-0090,ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain thence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles and gives motion to all the members so that to account for other parts of the blood which as most agitated and penetrating,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2426,311-124404-0091,proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2427,311-124404-0092,in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2428,311-124404-0093,which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2429,311-124404-0094,i had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treatise which i formerly thought of publishing and after these i had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscles of the human body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2430,311-124404-0095,to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth although no longer animated what changes must take place in the brain to produce,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2431,311-124404-0096,waking sleep and dreams how light sounds odors tastes heat and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means of the senses how hunger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2432,311-124404-0097,thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it divers ideas what must be understood by the common sense sensus communis in which these ideas are received by the memory which retains them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2433,311-124404-0098,by the fantasy which can change them in various ways and out of them compose new ideas and which by the same means distributing the animal spirits through the muscles can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2434,311-124404-0099,to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata or moving machines fabricated by human industry and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2435,311-124404-0100,muscles nerves arteries veins and other parts that are found in the body of each animal such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of god which is incomparably better arranged,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2436,311-124404-0101,and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine of human invention and here i specially stayed to show that were there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2437,311-124404-0102,we could have no means of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals but if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2438,311-124404-0103,our thoughts to others for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2439,311-124404-0104,for example if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it is hurt and such like,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2440,311-124404-0105,appositely to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2441,311-124404-0106,these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2442,311-124404-0107,that there are no men so dull and stupid not even idiots as to be incapable of joining together different words and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2443,311-124404-0108,destitute of the organs which others use in speaking are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their thoughts to those who being usually in their company have leisure to learn their language,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2444,311-124404-0109,and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2445,311-124404-0110,and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species as well as among men and since some are more capable of being instructed than others it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2446,311-124404-0111,should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack brained unless the soul of brutes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2447,311-124404-0112,and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brutes speak although we do not understand their language,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2448,311-124404-0113,since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2449,311-124404-0114,that though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others so that the circumstance that they do better,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2450,311-124404-0115,and could surpass us in all things on the contrary it rather proves that they are destitute of reason and that it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs thus it is seen that a clock composed only of wheels and weights,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2451,311-124404-0116,can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2452,311-124404-0117,as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2453,311-124404-0118,but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2454,311-124404-0119,there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2455,311-124404-0120,and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for or fear more than flies and ants in place of which when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the reasons which establish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2456,311-124404-0121,because no other causes are observed capable of destroying it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2457,4788-94904-0000,we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement as they range lower and lower in development,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2458,4788-94904-0001,that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them though this is not true universally for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2459,4788-94904-0002,as upon the degree in which they possess certain special requisites requisites however so closely connected with their degree of general advancement that any variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2460,4788-94904-0003,that they should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the functions which it imposes on them the willingness of the people to accept representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler or a foreign nation or nations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2461,4788-94904-0004,who have gained power over the country are disposed to offer it the boon to individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant since if no other objection can be made to their enterprise than that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2462,4788-94904-0005,they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at when opinion is really adverse its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2463,4788-94904-0006,the contrary case is not indeed unexampled there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2464,4788-94904-0007,whether monarchical or popular in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made indifference to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2465,4788-94904-0008,rather than positive opposition are the obstacles to be expected these however are as fatal and may be as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion it being easier in most cases to change the direction of an active feeling than to create one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2466,4788-94904-0009,in a state previously passive when a people have no sufficient value for and attachment to a representative constitution they have next to no chance of retaining it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2467,4788-94904-0010,and is in direct contact with the public to it principally the hopes and fears of individuals are directed and by it both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2468,4788-94904-0011,unless therefore the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive has always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2469,4788-94904-0012,and is sure to be well supported in doing so representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of their being endangered if too little valued for this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2470,4788-94904-0013,they seldom obtain a footing at all and if they do are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government or any party leader who can muster force for a coup de main is willing to run some small risk for absolute power,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2471,4788-94904-0014,these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2472,4788-94904-0015,when nobody or only some small fraction feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion the electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their private interest or the interest of their locality,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2473,4788-94904-0016,or of some one with whom they are connected as adherents or dependents the small class who in this state of public feeling gain the command of the representative body for the most part use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune if the executive is weak,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2474,4788-94904-0017,the country is distracted by mere struggles for place if strong it makes itself despotic at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives or such of them as are capable of giving trouble by a share of the spoil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2475,4788-94904-0018,and the only fruit produced by national representation is that in addition to those who really govern there is an assembly quartered on the public and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are interested is at all likely to be removed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2476,4788-94904-0019,when however the evil stops here the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which though not an invariable are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2477,4788-94904-0020,that the place hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly though they contribute little or nothing directly to good government nor even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2478,4788-94904-0021,which exists in that country this benefit however is entirely dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary king if instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler these selfish and sordid factions struggled for the chief place itself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2479,4788-94904-0022,they would certainly as in spanish america keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war a despotism not even legal but of illegal violence would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2480,4788-94904-0023,and the name and forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from attaining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2481,4788-94904-0024,there are others in which it possibly might exist but in which some other form of government would be preferable these are principally when the people in order to advance in civilization have some lesson to learn some habit not yet acquired,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2482,4788-94904-0025,to the acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an impediment the most obvious of these cases is the one already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization that of obedience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2483,4788-94904-0026,a race who have been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2484,4788-94904-0027,a representative assembly drawn from among themselves would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination it would refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose on their savage independence any improving restraint,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2485,4788-94904-0028,a military leader is the only superior to whom they will submit except occasionally some prophet supposed to be inspired from above or conjurer regarded as possessing miraculous power these may exercise a temporary ascendancy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2486,4788-94904-0029,but as it is merely personal it rarely effects any change in the general habits of the people unless the prophet like mohammed is also a military chief and goes forth the armed apostle of a new religion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2487,4788-94904-0030,or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified by extreme passiveness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2488,4788-94904-0031,and ready submission to tyranny if a people thus prostrated by character and circumstances could obtain representative institutions they would inevitably choose their tyrants as their representatives and the yoke would be made heavier on them by the contrivance which,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2489,4788-94904-0032,might be expected to lighten it on the contrary many a people has gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central authority whose position has made it the rival and has ended by making it the master of the local despots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2490,4788-94904-0033,even when the king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief feudatories the great advantage which he derived from being but one has been recognized by french historians to him the eyes of all the locally oppressed were turned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2491,4788-94904-0034,he was the object of hope and reliance throughout the kingdom while each local potentate was only powerful within a more or less confined space at his hands refuge and protection were sought from every part of the country against first one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2492,4788-94904-0035,then another of the immediate oppressors his progress to ascendancy was slow but it resulted from successively taking advantage of opportunities which offered themselves only to him it was therefore sure and in proportion as it was accomplished,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2493,4788-94904-0036,it abated in the oppressed portion of the community the habit of submitting to oppression the king's interest lay in encouraging all partial attempts on the part of the serfs to emancipate themselves from their masters and place themselves in immediate subordination to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2494,4788-94904-0037,under his protection numerous communities were formed which knew no one above them but the king,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2495,4788-94904-0038,and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation in this manner a central power despotic in principle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2496,4788-94904-0039,though generally much restricted in practice was mainly instrumental in carrying the people through a necessary stage of improvement which representative government if real would most likely have prevented them from entering upon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2503,4788-294466-0006,they're nice boys aren't they mary said i've always wished i had a brother and i do believe jerry is going to be just like one aloud dora replied i have noticed that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2504,4788-294466-0007,oh mary how blind you are dreamily the younger girl was saying that's because we were playmates when we were little so very long ago oh my how ancient we are dora said teasingly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2505,4788-294466-0008,please remember that you are only one year younger than i am and i refuse to be called elderly mary smiled faintly but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist a wonderfully pretty wistful little girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2506,4788-294466-0009,when she spoke she said it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have my mother met dad in bisbee where he was a mining engineer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2507,4788-294466-0010,and jerry's mother taught a little desert school over near the newcomb ranch she didn't teach long though for that very first vacation she married jerry's cowboy father after that mother and missus newcomb were good friends naturally being brides and neighbors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2508,4788-294466-0011,when jerry and i were little we were playmates i spent days at the ranch sometimes her sweet face was very sad as she ended with until mother died when i was eight then you came east to boarding school and became like a sister to me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2509,4788-294466-0012,far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2510,4788-294466-0013,it was very still not a sound was to be heard now and then a rabbit darted past silently how peaceful this hour is on the desert mary began glancing at her friend who was riding so close at her side,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2511,4788-294466-0014,noticing that dora was deep in thought she asked lightly won't you say it out loud why of course i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loon's rock house because he had to do the milking mary replied simply,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2512,4788-294466-0015,dora nodded so he said then she hastened to add oh don't think i'm inferring that jerry told an untruth but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glanced up startled dora bellman she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2513,4788-294466-0016,i don't believe he will tell us about that i acted so like a scare cat all the time we were there he won't ever take us there again and he probably won't tell us the story either then i'll find it out some other way dora declared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2514,4788-294466-0017,i'm crazy about mysteries as you know and if there really is one about that rock house i want to try to solve it she said no more about it just then as they had reached the old ghost town of gleeson,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2515,4788-294466-0018,in the long ago days when the town had been teeming with life picturesque looking miners and ranchers had sat there tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns today the chairs were empty an old man shriveled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2516,4788-294466-0019,gray bearded unkempt but with kind gray eyes deep sunken under shaggy brows stood in the open door he smiled out at them in a friendly way then beckoned with a bony finger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2517,4788-294466-0020,i do believe mister harvey has a letter for us dora said the old man had shuffled into the dark well of his store a moment later he reappeared with several letters and a newspaper good,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2518,4788-294466-0021,dora exclaimed as she rode close to the porch thanks a lot she called brightly up to the old man who was handing the packet down over the sagging wooden rail his friendly toothless smile was directed at the smaller girl,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2519,4788-294466-0022,he said mis farley yer nurse woman came down ter mail some letters a spell back then before mary could reply he continued in his shrill wavering voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2522,4788-294466-0025,bustin broncs mary smiled in appreciation of the old man's joke no jerry won't expect dick to do that right at first he's official fence mender just at present dora defended the absent boy mister harvey,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2524,4788-294466-0027,some with broken windows and doors others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls the only sign of life was in three small adobes where poor mexican families lived broken windows in two of the houses were stuffed with rags,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2525,4788-294466-0028,a bright black eyed mexican boy of about ten ran out to the road as the girls approached come on emanuel mary sang down to him you may put up our horses and earn a dime the small boy's white teeth flashed in a delighted grin,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2526,4788-294466-0029,his brown feet raced so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square two storied adobe near the mountains emanuel was there to lead their horses around back mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flower edged walk,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2527,4788-294466-0030,its broad porch and adobe pillars here her mother had come as a bride here mary had been born eight happy years they had spent together before her mother died after mary had been taken east to school her father had returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2528,4788-294466-0031,then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom she asked eagerly may i tell dad an adventure we've had missus farley middle aged kind faced shook her head smiling down at the girl not tonight please won't tomorrow do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2529,4788-91208-0000,it looks big and important and it makes a great noise even people a long way up in the scale of civilization are in the habit of taking these attributes perhaps not as the essential ones of leadership but at all events as those by which a leader may be recognized,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2530,4788-91208-0001,the pointsman moves a handle and the foaming giant that would it may be have sped on to his destruction and that of the passive crew who follow in his rear is shunted to another line running in a different direction and to a more desirable goal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2531,4788-91208-0002,the great intellectual pointsman of our age the man who has done more than any other of this generation to give direction to the thought of his contemporaries has passed away and we are left to measure the loss to humanity by the result of his labors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2532,4788-91208-0003,mister mill's achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society he is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2533,4788-91208-0004,the structure raised by adam smith malthus and ricardo but raised it at least one story higher his inestimable system of logic was a revolution it hardly needs of course to be said that he owed much to his predecessors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2534,4788-91208-0005,that he borrowed from whewell much of his classification from brown the chief lines of his theory of causation from sir john herschel the main principles of the inductive methods those who think this a disparagement of his work must have very little conception,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2535,4788-91208-0006,of the mass of original thought that still remains to mister mill's credit the great critical power that could gather valuable truths from so many discordant sources and the wonderful synthetic ability required to weld these and his own contributions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2536,4788-91208-0007,into one organic whole when mister mill commenced his labors the only logic recognized was the syllogistic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2537,4788-91208-0008,in deducing from general propositions other propositions less general it was even asserted confidently that nothing more was to be expected that an inductive logic was impossible this conception of logical science necessitated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2538,4788-91208-0009,some general propositions to start with and these general propositions being ex,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2539,4788-91208-0010,incapable of being proved from other propositions it followed that if they were known to us at all they must be original data of consciousness here was a perfect paradise of question begging the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2540,4788-91208-0011,it could of course be fashioned according to the particular conclusion it was called in to prove thus an artificial ignorance as locke calls it was produced which had the effect of sanctifying prejudice by recognizing so called necessities of thought,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2541,4788-91208-0012,as the only bases of reasoning it is true that outside of the logic of the schools great advances had been made in the rules of scientific investigation but these rules were not only imperfect in themselves but their connection with the law of causation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2542,4788-91208-0013,was but imperfectly realized and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of mister mill altered all this he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars nor from particulars to generals but from particulars to particulars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2543,4788-91208-0014,but are now dead we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal we might surely without any logical inconsequence have concluded at once from those instances that the duke of wellington is mortal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2544,4788-91208-0015,the mortality of john thomas and others is after all the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the duke of wellington not one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a general proposition,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2545,4788-91208-0016,we not only may according to mister mill reason from some particular instances to others but we frequently do so as however the instances which are sufficient to prove one fresh instance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2546,4788-91208-0017,the work of deduction is the interpretation of these formulas and therefore strictly speaking is not inferential at all the real inference was accomplished when the universal proposition was arrived at,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2547,4788-91208-0018,all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic and to induction accordingly mister mill devoted his chief attention for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2548,4788-91208-0019,and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin it was this taken with his theory of the syllogism which worked the great change both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2549,4788-91208-0020,are for the most part devoted to fortifying this position and demolishing beliefs inconsistent with it as a systematic psychologist mister mill has not done so much as either professor bain or mister herbert spencer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2550,4788-91208-0021,the perfection of his method its application and the uprooting of prejudices which stood in its way this was the task to which mister mill applied himself with an ability and success rarely matched and never surpassed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2551,4788-91208-0022,the biggest lion in the path was the doctrine of so called necessary truth this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth and a standard as he was easily able to show,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2552,4788-91208-0023,varying according to the psychological history of the individual such thinkers as doctor whewell and mister herbert spencer had to be met in intellectual combat doctor whewell held not that the inconceivability,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2553,4788-91208-0024,of the contradictory of a proposition is a proof of its truth co equal with experience but that its value transcends experience experience may tell us what is but it is by the impossibility of conceiving it otherwise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2554,4788-91208-0025,in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy mister mill gives battle to this mode of thought after reviewing in an opening chapter the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2555,4788-91208-0026,as mister mill says the name of god is veiled under two extremely abstract phrases infinite and the absolute so profound and friendly a thinker as the late mister grote held this raising of the veil inexpedient but he proved,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2556,4788-91208-0027,by a mistake he fell into the necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete he acknowledged the force of mister mill's argument that the infinite must include a farrago of contradictions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2557,4788-91208-0028,in which these contradictory attributes inhere but it was against a corresponding being the infinite that mister mill was arguing it is this that he calls a,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2558,4788-91208-0029,and regarded as the reductio ad absurdissimum of the transcendental philosophy mister mill's religious tendencies may very well be gathered from a passage in his review of auguste comte a philosopher with whom he agreed on all points,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2624,2989-138035-0060,senor it's my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2625,2989-138035-0061,and if that be so as no doubt it is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2626,2989-138035-0062,but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash i wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2627,2989-138035-0063,for god's sake sancho said don quixote here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2628,2989-138035-0064,one of them was that i was to be let say all i liked so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship's authority and so far it seems to me i have not broken the said article,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2629,2989-138035-0065,and even if it were so i desire you to hold your tongue and come along for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning and not in the heat of the afternoon,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2630,2989-138035-0066,and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots for they were six half wine jars each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2631,2989-138035-0067,they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2632,2989-138035-0068,of over six gallons each and all filled as it proved afterwards with generous wines there were besides piles of the whitest bread like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing floors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2633,2989-138035-0069,there was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick work and two cauldrons full of oil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2634,2989-138035-0070,and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by of cooks and cook maids there were over fifty all clean brisk and blithe in the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking pigs which sewn up there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2635,2989-138035-0071,the spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter and all lay open to view in a great chest,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2636,2989-138035-0072,but abundant enough to feed an army,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2637,2989-138035-0073,contemplated all and everything won his heart the first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2638,2989-138035-0074,get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two and much good may they do you i don't see one said sancho wait a bit said the cook sinner that i am how particular and bashful you are,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2639,2989-138035-0075,and so saying he seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2640,2989-138035-0076,fall to friend and take the edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner time comes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2641,2989-138035-0077,well then said the cook take spoon and all for camacho's wealth and happiness furnish everything,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2642,2989-138035-0078,don quixote was watching the entrance at one end of the arcade of some twelve peasants all in holiday and gala dress,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2643,2989-138028-0000,chapter six of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper one of the most important chapters in the whole history,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2644,2989-138028-0001,but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2645,2989-138028-0002,what answer god will give to your complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer either i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they present every day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2646,2989-138028-0003,and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him whereupon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majesty's court are there no knights there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right there should be,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2647,2989-138028-0004,to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the king's majesty then might not your worship said she be one of those that without stirring a step serve their king and lord in his court,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2648,2989-138028-0005,there must be all sorts in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2649,2989-138028-0006,there is a great difference between one and another for the courtiers without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2650,2989-138028-0007,but we the true knights errant measure the whole earth with our own feet exposed to the sun to the cold to the air to the inclemencies of heaven by day and night on foot and on horseback,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2651,2989-138028-0008,nor do we only know enemies in pictures but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2652,2989-138028-0009,whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing about but i do,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2653,2989-138028-0010,and you must know besides that the true knight errant though he may see ten giants that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them and that go each of them on two tall towers by way of legs and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships and each eye like a great mill wheel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2654,2989-138028-0011,and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2655,2989-138028-0012,wield trenchant blades of damascus steel or clubs studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than once seen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2656,2989-138028-0013,and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second or more properly speaking first kind of knights errant for as we read in their histories,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2657,2989-138028-0014,i would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights errant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2658,2989-138028-0015,for he was the most humble minded and courteous knight of his time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2659,2989-138028-0016,but some there are that might have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for they are not all courteous or mannerly some are ill conditioned scoundrels nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2660,2989-138028-0017,and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2661,2989-138028-0018,god bless me said the niece that you should know so much uncle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2662,2989-138028-0019,and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above all a caballero when you are not one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2663,2989-138028-0020,all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintained them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2664,2989-138028-0021,and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2665,2989-138028-0022,those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2666,2989-138028-0023,for examples of the second sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2667,2989-138028-0024,of countless princes monarchs lords medes assyrians persians greeks and barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2668,2989-138028-0025,for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants and even should we find one it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebeian lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2669,2989-138028-0026,and not by spending as he pleases but by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable well bred courteous gentle mannered and kindly not haughty arrogant or censorious,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2670,2989-138028-0027,but above all by being charitable for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues i have named,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2671,2989-138028-0028,even though he know him not will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood and it would be strange were it not so praise has ever been the reward of virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2672,2989-138028-0029,there are two roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and honours one is that of letters the other that of arms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2673,2989-138028-0030,i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2674,2989-138028-0031,and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills fate ordains reason requires and above all my own inclination favours for knowing as i do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight errantry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2675,2989-138028-0032,i know too the infinite blessings that are attained by it i know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of vice broad and spacious i know their ends and goals are different for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2676,2989-138028-0033,i know as our great castilian poet says that it is by rugged paths like these they go that scale the heights of immortality unreached by those that falter here below,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2677,2989-138028-0034,i can tell you niece replied don quixote if these chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties there would be nothing that i could not do nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands particularly cages and tooth picks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2678,2989-138028-0035,at this moment there came a knocking at the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2679,2989-138028-0036,nothing senor samson said she only that my master is breaking out plainly breaking out whereabouts is he breaking out senora asked samson has any part of his body burst he is only breaking out at the door of his madness she replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2680,2989-138028-0037,so that to bring him round again ever so little cost me more than six hundred eggs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2681,2989-138028-0038,that i can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress housekeeper that is all,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2682,2989-138028-0039,say the prayer of santa apollonia that is if you know it for i will come presently and you will see miracles woe is me cried the housekeeper,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2694,2989-138028-0051,and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2695,2989-138028-0052,and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2697,2989-138028-0054,bene quidem if not we remain friends for if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not lack pigeons and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and a good grievance better than a bad compensation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2699,2989-138028-0056,the arch wag samson came forward and embracing him as he had done before said with a loud voice o flower of knight errantry o shining light of arms o honour and mirror of the spanish nation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2700,2989-138028-0057,may god almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons who would impede or hinder thy third sally may find no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes nor ever accomplish what they most desire and then turning to the housekeeper he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2701,2989-138028-0058,for i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did i not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2702,2989-138028-0059,any longer curbed and checked for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2704,2989-138028-0061,on then my lord don quixote beautiful and brave let your worship and highness set out to day rather than to morrow and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2705,2989-138028-0062,with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight errant's squire but heaven forbid that to gratify my own inclination i should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2706,2989-138028-0063,let this new samson remain in his own country and bringing honour to it bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents for i will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not deign to accompany me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2707,2989-138028-0064,the bread eaten and the company dispersed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2708,2989-138028-0065,who the panzas from whom i am descended were and what is more i know and have learned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2709,2989-138028-0066,no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow which i can't deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take it amiss,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2710,2989-138028-0067,and so there's nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can't be provoked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2711,2989-138028-0068,so i offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally as well and better than all the squires that served knights errant in times past or present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2712,2989-138028-0069,as he was there described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be revoked,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2713,2989-138028-0070,in fine don quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who was now their oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence by which time they could have,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2714,2989-138028-0071,all that was requisite for the journey ready and procure a closed helmet which don quixote said he must by all means take samson offered him one as he knew a friend of his,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2715,2989-138028-0072,poured out on the bachelor were past counting they tore their hair they clawed their faces and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2716,2989-138028-0073,samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2717,2989-138028-0074,with whom he had previously discussed the subject,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2718,2989-138028-0075,his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals and his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2719,7113-86041-0000,rubezahl over all the vast under world the mountain gnome rubezahl was lord and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2720,7113-86041-0001,and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2721,7113-86041-0002,for rubezahl loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2722,7113-86041-0003,and as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things for the first time he came up the great hills were covered with thick forests,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2723,7113-86041-0004,to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills but the next time he ventured above ground what was his surprise to find everything changed the dark woods were hewn down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2724,7113-86041-0005,and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosy looking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2725,7113-86041-0006,came the music of the shepherd's pipe the strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests who without saying by your leave or with your leave,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2726,7113-86041-0007,nor did he wish to interfere with their doings but left them in quiet possession of their homes as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2727,7113-86041-0008,he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man so taking the form of an old field labourer he entered the service of a farmer under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2728,7113-86041-0009,but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful and rubezahl soon left him and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2729,7113-86041-0010,and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away that they too prospered under his care and not one was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well earned wages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2730,7113-86041-0011,so he ran away and went to serve the judge here he upheld the law with might and main and was a terror to thieves and evildoers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2731,7113-86041-0012,down to his underground palace very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind but as time went on he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him and thought he would take another look at the upper world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2732,7113-86041-0013,where stood a charming maiden fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon around her upon the grass lay her young companions as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2733,7113-86041-0014,beyond them flowed a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2734,7113-86041-0015,the sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2735,7113-86041-0016,he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels and a nest of field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2736,7113-86041-0017,when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young man that was the best way and he fell in love with the girl then and there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2737,7113-86041-0018,the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2738,7113-86041-0019,by the brook to rest or to bathe in the cool waters on this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2739,7113-86041-0020,stepping out of his hiding place,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2740,7113-86041-0021,weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting place they stood lost in amazement and almost fancied that they must be dreaming,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2741,7113-86041-0022,the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed flowed in silence now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2742,7113-86041-0023,as the wandering breeze scattered it daisies and forget me nots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2743,7113-86041-0024,were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2744,7113-86041-0025,but at length curiosity prevailed and she and her companions explored to their heart's content,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2745,7113-86041-0026,running hither and thither in high glee and calling merrily to each other at last when they were quite weary the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2746,7113-86041-0027,which certainly did look very inviting and they all went gaily to this new amusement the princess was ready first but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down down down she sank,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2747,7113-86041-0028,and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair loudly did they weep and wail running about the brink of the pool which looked so shallow and so clear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2748,7113-86041-0029,but which had swallowed up their princess before their eyes they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her but in vain they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool and could not keep under water for a second,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2749,7113-86041-0030,they saw at last that there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughter's disappearance and what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2750,7113-86041-0031,the scene of this strange adventure thinking as people will in sorrow that there might be some mistake after all but when he reached the spot behold all was changed again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2751,7113-86041-0032,the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished and so had the marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2752,7113-86041-0033,the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princess's playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2753,7113-86041-0034,sprite or goblin and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2754,7113-86041-0035,they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her father's seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2755,7113-86041-0036,wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he it was told her all about himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2756,7113-86041-0037,and his great underground kingdom and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendour,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2757,7113-86041-0038,on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady which pleased the eye of the princess the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2758,7113-86041-0039,and nightingales sang in every bush as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys sometimes gazing at the moon sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2759,7113-86041-0040,but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome however he soon perceived her melancholy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2760,7113-86041-0041,and in a thousand ways strove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2762,7113-86041-0043,carrots turnips and radishes and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who sat pensive in the shade of the rose bower loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2764,7113-86041-0045,take this little many coloured wand and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see with this he left her and the princess without an instant's delay opened the basket,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2765,7113-86041-0046,this sudden appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2766,7113-86041-0047,and gathered the golden apples from the trees and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2767,7113-86041-0048,the gnome had given to his hoped for bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes veils girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2768,7113-86041-0049,and showed so much taste that nobody,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2769,7113-86041-0050,the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2770,7113-86041-0051,she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand and soon had all her maidens about her and even as she had two tiny radishes to spare,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2771,7113-86041-0052,whose name was beni and now all went cheerfully in the castle the princess gave to each of the maidens her task and never was mistress better served for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2772,7113-86041-0053,they played from morning to night only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2773,7113-86041-0054,while brunhilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2774,7113-86041-0055,take part in the games of the princess till at last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows she shuddered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2775,7113-86041-0056,and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones with bent backs and trembling limbs who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2776,7113-86041-0057,lay the once frolicsome beni with all four feet stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion the horrified princess fled to the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2777,7113-86041-0058,the greatest delight of my lonely hours isn't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your turning the castle into a hospital for the aged give my maidens back their youth and health this very minute or i will never love you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2778,7113-86041-0059,sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will do but do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2779,7113-86041-0060,the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired but as the sap dried up they withered away but never trouble yourself about that dearest one a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2780,7113-86041-0061,and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see the great green patch in the garden will prove you with a more lively company so saying the gnome took himself off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2781,7113-86041-0062,and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2782,7113-86041-0063,to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2783,7113-86041-0064,by the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2784,7113-86041-0065,dear queen of my heart answered he i pray you to forgive my carelessness i promised more than i could perform i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty cellars,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2785,7113-86041-0066,and the fields are bare and desolate for below in the valley winter reigns only here in your presence spring is held fast and wherever your foot is set the gay flowers bloom have patience for a little,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2786,7113-86041-0067,and then without fail you shall have your puppets to play with almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without deigning to answer him the gnome however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2787,7113-86041-0068,and disguising himself as a farmer bought an ass in the nearest market town and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip carrot and radish seed with this he sowed a great field,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2788,7113-86041-0069,and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds thus fostered they grew and flourished marvellously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2789,7113-86041-0070,he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him but that was a mistake for the truth was that another image already filled her heart the young prince ratibor whose lands joined her father's had won the heart of the princess,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2790,7113-86041-0071,looking forward to the coming of their wedding day when the bride's mysterious disappearance took place the sad news drove ratibor distracted and as the days went on and nothing could be heard of the princess he forsook his castle,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2791,7113-86041-0072,and the society of men and spent his days in the wild forests roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks meanwhile the maiden in her gorgeous prison sighed in secret over her grief not wishing to arouse the gnome's suspicions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2792,7113-86041-0073,in her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity and at last she hit upon a plan by this time spring once more reigned in the valley and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2793,7113-86041-0074,for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them conjuring up now this longed for person and now that,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2794,7113-86041-0075,just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another purpose in view one day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover fly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2795,7113-86041-0076,so the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2796,7113-86041-0077,then and there after that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting hop little cricket to ratibor and chirp in his ear that i love him only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2797,7113-86041-0078,but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains so the cricket hopped off gaily determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a long legged stork who was prancing along the same road,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2798,7113-86041-0079,caught him in her cruel beak and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2799,7113-86041-0080,this time she changed the turnip into a magpie flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said she till you come to ratibor my love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2800,7113-86041-0081,and bid him come with horses and men the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley the magpie listened hopped awhile from branch to branch and then darted away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2801,7113-86041-0082,now prince ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief one day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2802,7113-86041-0083,which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever thereupon he caught up a great stone,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2803,7113-86041-0084,but the magpie in the tree who like,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2804,7113-86041-0085,unless he could be for ever chattering,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2805,7113-86041-0086,all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learnt so he soon fluttered away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2806,7113-86041-0087,while the prince hurried back to his castle to gather together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall the princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of escape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2807,7113-86041-0088,she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love and the idea pleased him mightily the next day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2808,7113-86041-0089,as soon as the sun rose she made her appearance decked as a bride in the wonderful robes and jewels which the fond gnome had prepared for her her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle blossoms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2809,7113-86041-0090,and her flowing veil sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2810,7113-86041-0091,your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears why tears beloved one cried the gnome anxiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2811,7113-86041-0092,every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold greatly as i desire your love i do not ask a sacrifice ah cried the false princess why do you misunderstand my tears,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2812,7113-86041-0093,and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2813,7113-86041-0094,ask some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love be it so answered the crafty maiden then give me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2814,7113-86041-0095,that shall be the test of your truth towards me unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2815,7113-86041-0096,he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2816,7113-86041-0097,this time to his great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princess's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2817,7113-86041-0098,pretty looks and words as for the maiden no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2818,7113-86041-0099,which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2819,7113-86041-0100,into the arms of her beloved prince ratibor meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again till his back ached and his head swam and he could no longer put two and two together,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2820,7113-86041-0101,but as he felt tolerably certain of the exact number of turnips in the field big and little together he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be he felt very well satisfied with himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2821,7113-86041-0102,as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her but alas she was no longer there he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2822,7113-86041-0103,but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name but only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2823,7113-86041-0104,echo answered in the marble halls there was neither voice nor footstep then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2824,7113-86041-0105,and soared high into the air and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions furiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2825,7113-86041-0106,and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years but his fury was vain the thunderclouds melted away into a soft mist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2826,7113-86041-0107,and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stole once more through every room with many sighs and lamentations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2827,7113-86041-0108,he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princess's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief all was lonely empty sorrowful,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2828,7113-86041-0109,and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2829,7113-86041-0110,to the depths of his underground kingdom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2830,5390-24512-0000,for although the jewish family of the herods reigned over judea they only held their throne under the roman emperor this the jews could not endure they longed to be a free and independent nation once again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2831,5390-24512-0001,when our messiah comes he will be a great warrior they said he will utterly destroy all our enemies he will make jerusalem the greatest and richest city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2832,5390-24512-0002,had jesus of nazareth been willing to become their earthly king and to lead the nation against the romans the jews would probably have followed him to a man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2833,5390-24512-0003,the saviour sought to heal it he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centurion and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesar's,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2834,5390-24512-0004,showed them the right attitude in which to regard the roman rule,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2835,5390-24512-0005,the roman government had no quarrel with him thine own nation hath delivered thee unto me,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2836,5390-24512-0006,had not the jews prevented it if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend they cried,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2837,5390-24512-0007,to crucify jesus of nazareth and to free barabbas but in choosing the rebel barabbas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2838,5390-24512-0008,as their hero the nation started on their downward road as the story of the forty years which followed the saviour's crucifixion clearly shows for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2839,5390-24512-0009,and the history of those years is one long list of terrible risings and massacres while cities were ruined villages wrapped in flames and men women and children perished with hunger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2840,5390-24512-0010,yet the keener the suffering the more desperate the jews became their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2841,5390-24512-0011,then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not matthew,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2842,5390-24512-0012,yet no sooner did a daring rebel or murderer gather a band of robbers around him and begin to kill and plunder than multitudes of jews cried the christ or messiah has come,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2843,5390-24512-0013,where the roman soldiers were quartered and cried out to the garrison within that their lives should be spared if they would lay down their weapons the roman soldiers hesitated but the jews promised most faithfully to keep their word,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2844,5390-24512-0014,the romans believed them and opened their gates but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man as they died the roman soldiers whom not even death could terrify,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2845,5390-24512-0015,lifted up their hands to heaven as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2846,5390-24512-0016,and he sent a great army against jerusalem the jews shut the gates of their city and so began the awful siege of jerusalem and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2847,5390-24512-0017,he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2848,5390-24512-0018,as one by one their defences fell and the end drew near then food failed in the city men fought like demons in the streets for a tiny loaf of barley bread so frantic were the people with hunger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2849,5390-24512-0019,that mothers even snatched the bread from their own children's mouths look over the walls o people of jerusalem the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2850,5390-24512-0020,hard merciless as was the roman general even he grew sick with horror at last and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews promising them their lives if they would give up the city,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2851,5390-24512-0021,but a furious madness had possessed the people and they refused to yield josephus pleaded in vain he was not a christian but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2852,5390-24512-0022,ah my countrymen he cried we did nothing without god in the past but now you are fighting against him had god judged you worthy of freedom he would have punished the romans as he did the assyrians long ago,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2853,5390-24512-0023,even a jew who had no faith in jesus christ could see plainly that the ancient power and glory of his nation had gone at last the end came the first wall fell,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2854,5390-24512-0024,which still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sunbeams struck full on its golden roof then redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2855,5390-24512-0025,pillars fell beams crumbled to ashes while round the altar of sacrifice the people of jerusalem lay heaped together slain in such numbers in the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2856,5390-24512-0026,and the golden candlestick and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen rome alas for the holy city over which the saviour of the world had stood and wept forty years before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2857,5390-24512-0027,knowing the suffering that lay before her these jews are dangerous we must not allow them to rebuild their city or to become a separate people again as a nation they must cease to exist,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2858,5390-24512-0028,so the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own they have indeed been led away captive into all nations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2859,5390-24512-0029,exactly as the lord foretold there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers and is the property of the turkish nation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2860,5390-24512-0030,the jews were now no longer a nation they had become merely a body of people led by their rabbis or teachers of the law but they were still the people of the book,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2861,5390-24512-0031,they allowed the jewish teachers to continue the synagogue services in other parts of palestine and to teach in their colleges the most famous jewish college of these days was at tiberius on the shores of the sea of galilee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2862,5390-24512-0032,over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often and beside whose shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy a great and beautiful college it was with broad terraced gardens,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2863,5390-24512-0033,so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible as we have seen the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god just as it stood they had begun even in our lord's day,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2864,5390-24512-0034,that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud explanation the law of moses is like salt but the talmud is balmy spice they would say,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2865,5390-24512-0035,yet although they heeded so little the true meaning of god's book they guarded its words more and more carefully and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict indeed my son an old teacher would say to his pupil,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2866,5390-24512-0036,before you copy a single word you must wash your body all over and clothe yourself in full jewish dress preparing your mind with solemn thoughts the parchment you write upon must be made from the skins of clean animals only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2917,5390-30102-0003,a young man of position in the city but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing one of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage when away from her frivolous mother,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2918,5390-30102-0004,and the inconsequent home environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency one thing was indisputable however,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2920,5390-30102-0006,and while she would have been more lovable without any pretence or sham she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was patsy and beth thought they knew her,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2922,5390-30102-0008,an extensive course of light literature not void of detective stories had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to scent a mystery in the history of captain wegg,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2925,5390-30102-0011,it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at millville and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detective,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2930,5390-30102-0016,the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word why unless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible in the fifth place there was old hucks and his blind wife to be considered,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2931,5390-30102-0017,what did they know about their old master's secret history what tragic memories lurked beneath the man's perpetual smile and the woman's composed and sightless face surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2932,5390-30102-0018,and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery and as instruments to the end there were several people available who could be of use to her mc nutt the agent who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell old hucks and his wife,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2933,5390-30102-0019,and ethel thompson the school teacher there might be others but one or another of these four must know the truth and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2934,5390-30102-0020,when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs louise said to him i've been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness that's true he replied,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2937,5390-30102-0023,but he turned without a word to harness the horse louise stood watching him your fingers are quite nimble thomas considering the fact that you were once a sailor she said but sailors have to be nimble miss he returned,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

2940,5390-30102-0026,dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle john stood awaiting his niece,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2941,5390-30102-0027,i understand dan well i don't returned uncle john in his whimsical way as he mounted to the seat beside her i don't understand how he's happened to live since the landing of columbus or what he's good for,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2942,5390-30102-0028,or why someone don't knock him on the head dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2943,5390-30102-0029,do you know where the thompsons live inquired uncle john no whoa dan that was the best thing the nag did he knew how to whoa thomas called uncle john turning in his seat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2944,5390-30102-0030,and at the summons old hucks came from the barn and approached them how do you get to miss thompson's place miss ethel's another fleeting expression of surprise yes we're going over to thank her for her kindness to us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2945,5390-30102-0031,thompson's stammered hucks glancing up at them with his bright elusive smile well we're going anyhow growled mister merrick,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2946,1743-142912-0000,and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2947,1743-142912-0001,he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of chebec's did you say your fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way that's what i said replied chebec he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2948,1743-142912-0002,the rest of us always feel safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2949,1743-142912-0003,at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2950,1743-142912-0004,of course peter couldn't be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2951,1743-142912-0005,and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2952,1743-142912-0006,a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2953,1743-142912-0007,he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2954,1743-142912-0008,he wasn't afraid and he intended that everybody should know it especially redtail it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling redtail a robber and every other bad name he could think of,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2955,1743-142912-0009,all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2956,1743-142912-0010,scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2957,1743-142912-0011,peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the flycatchers there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2958,1743-142912-0012,scrapper's slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2959,1743-142912-0013,and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebec's did when he caught a fly but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2960,1743-142912-0014,it reminded peter that he had often heard scrapper called the bee martin and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2961,1743-142912-0015,there wouldn't be any honey if i did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2962,1743-142912-0016,those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that don't,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2963,1743-142912-0017,i'm one of farmer brown's best friends if he did but know it you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have i'd like to know who it is,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2964,1743-142912-0018,there's a fly way over there beyond that old apple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2965,1743-142912-0019,but if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrapper's bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught that fly and it had tasted good,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2966,1743-142912-0020,are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2967,1743-142912-0021,turning away toward the green meadows instead peter didn't wait for scrapper to return,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2968,1743-142912-0022,just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard some one called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2969,1743-142912-0023,every way but the right way look up over your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2970,1743-142912-0024,it was cresty the great crested flycatcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2971,1743-142912-0025,his throat and breast were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2972,1743-142912-0026,you seem to be in a hurry so don't let me detain you peter said cresty before peter could find his tongue i just want to ask one little favor of you what is it asked peter who,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2973,1743-142912-0027,if in your roaming about you run across an old cast off suit of mister black snake or of any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said cresty a a,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2974,1743-142912-0028,a what stammered peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied cresty somewhat impatiently now don't forget peter i've got to go house hunting but you'll find me there or hereabouts if it happens that you find one of those,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2975,1743-142912-0029,cast off snake suits before peter could say another word cresty had flown away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch and then towards jenny wren's house,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2976,1743-142912-0030,he just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny wren could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered lipperty lipperty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2977,1743-142912-0031,jenny called peter jenny wren jenny wren no one answered him he could hear mister wren singing in another tree but he couldn't see him jenny jenny wren jenny wren called peter again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2978,1743-142912-0032,this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2979,1743-142912-0033,didn't i peter rabbit didn't i didn't i you certainly did jenny you certainly did and i'm sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing but i just didn't know who else to go to,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2980,1743-142912-0034,go to for what snapped jenny wren what is it you've come to me for snake skins replied peter snake skins snake skins shrieked jenny wren,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2981,1743-142912-0035,you don't understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to know is why should cresty the flycatcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2982,1743-142912-0036,he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2983,1743-142914-0000,he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2984,1743-142914-0001,i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was one of the first birds to arrive and i've neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2985,1743-142914-0002,off he started lipperty lipperty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2986,1743-142914-0003,bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground was soft in places quite muddy peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2987,1743-142914-0004,from right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2988,1743-142914-0005,he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2989,1743-142914-0006,he scared me for a second then you are even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but longbill didn't peter turned quickly there was missus woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2990,1743-142914-0007,i didn't mean to scare him apologized peter i really didn't mean to do you think he was really very much scared,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2991,1743-142914-0008,i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2992,1743-142914-0009,i am glad it is no one but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it you'll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2993,1743-142914-0010,certainly i'll excuse you replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be longbill was making such a good meal of but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2994,1743-142914-0011,longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion peter had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2995,1743-142914-0012,he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2996,1743-142914-0013,his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it was his head that made him look queer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2997,1743-142914-0014,his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly longbill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2998,1743-142914-0015,then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2999,1743-142914-0016,for the first time peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes exclaimed peter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3000,1743-142914-0017,and was there a worm in every one asked peter his eyes very wide with interest longbill nodded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3001,1743-142914-0018,peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3002,1743-142914-0019,while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3003,1743-142914-0020,and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in asked peter longbill chuckled,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3004,1743-142914-0021,longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all that's the way i get them said he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3005,1743-142914-0022,i think there is one right under my feet now watch me get him longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3006,1743-142914-0023,that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all it's wonderful sighed peter i don't suppose any one else can find hidden worms that way my cousin jack snipe can replied longbill promptly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3007,1743-142914-0024,he feeds the same way i do only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3008,1743-142914-0025,now i must be running along i'm ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get so peter said good by and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3009,1743-142914-0026,there was a little pebbly beach running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long slender bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3010,1743-142914-0027,every few steps he would stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3011,1743-142914-0028,it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peter's peter greeted him joyously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3012,1743-142914-0029,before peter could say another word teeter came running towards him and it was plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something don't move peter rabbit don't move he cried why not demanded peter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3013,1743-142914-0030,just then missus teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3014,1743-142914-0031,missus teeter stood up and stepped aside then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for a lining four white eggs with big dark blotches on them,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3015,1743-142914-0032,they looked so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but for missus teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps missus teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3016,1743-142914-0033,it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it he wouldn't have known she was there,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3017,1743-142914-0034,my he exclaimed i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me said he i'm so thankful i didn't i don't see how you dare lay them in the open like this,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3018,1743-142913-0000,with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old briar patch on his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3019,1743-142913-0001,he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying pee wee pee wee pee wee peter chuckled happily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3020,1743-142913-0002,he usually is one of the last of the flycatcher family to arrive i didn't expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3021,1743-142913-0003,it didn't take peter long to find pewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw pewee fly out and make the same kind of a little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3022,1743-142913-0004,it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone pee wee pee wee pee wee,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3023,1743-142913-0005,but he wasn't sad as peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger than his cousin chebec but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3024,1743-142913-0006,the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing two whitish bars and he noticed that pewee's wings were longer than his tail which wasn't the case with chebec,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3025,1743-142913-0007,but no one could ever mistake pewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over aren't you here early asked peter pewee nodded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3026,1743-142913-0008,that is something i don't often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call you wood pewee pewee chuckled happily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3027,1743-142913-0009,it is so quiet and restful that i love it missus pewee and i are very retiring we do not like too many near neighbors you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while will you asked peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3028,1743-142913-0010,come as often as you like replied pewee the oftener the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the flycatcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3029,1743-142913-0011,that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3030,1743-142913-0012,but most of all peter thought about that queer request of cresty's and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mister black snake,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3031,1743-142913-0013,it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mister sun had kicked his bedclothes off,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3032,1743-142913-0014,jenny wren was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way and that way in that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3033,1743-142913-0015,then as peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest said she why they want it goodness knows but,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3034,1743-142913-0016,perhaps they think it will scare robbers away as for me i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that cresty and his wife are a handsome couple,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3035,1743-142913-0017,and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugh by the way where does cresty build asked peter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3036,1743-142913-0018,in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite as surprised as he felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny wren,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3037,1743-142913-0019,where are your eyes peter did you ever see a flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didn't wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3038,1743-142913-0020,there is downy the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute that's good i like to see that it means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3039,1743-142913-0021,i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3040,1743-142913-0022,the older it is the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3041,1743-142913-0023,winsome bluebird stupid snapped jenny wren peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and skimmer the tree swallow added jenny that's so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3042,1743-142913-0024,i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny wren nodded yank yank the nuthatch uses an old house i'm told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3043,1743-142913-0025,tommy tit the chickadee sometimes uses an old house then again he and missus chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3044,1743-142913-0026,then there are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl peter looked surprised i didn't suppose they nested in holes in trees he exclaimed they certainly do more's the pity snapped jenny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3045,1743-142913-0027,it would be a good thing for the rest of us if they didn't nest at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them killy always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3046,1743-142913-0028,spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine i've talked quite enough for one morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3047,1743-142913-0029,jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well what is it now she demanded have you got two homes asked peter goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3048,1743-142913-0030,one is all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mister wren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree it seems to me that he has carried enough in there to build two or three nests,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3049,8238-274553-0000,i'll have none o them ned knowles the baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family every member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3050,8238-274553-0001,was more or less remarkable for talent of some description the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which tieck a scion of the house has given a vivid,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3051,8238-274553-0002,threw a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental conformation in later days this insight grew more clear,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3052,8238-274553-0003,which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty fifth of june i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3053,8238-274553-0004,no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3054,8238-274553-0005,but letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3055,8238-274553-0006,manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3056,8238-274553-0007,that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung then of no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3057,8238-274553-0008,he might have been fifteen or fifty,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3058,8238-274553-0009,he was by no means a handsome man perhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3059,8238-274553-0010,after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features conveying so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3060,8238-274553-0011,solemnity and repose it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3061,8238-274553-0012,the study and the business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3062,8238-274553-0013,i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3063,8238-274553-0014,ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practical the old bull dog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused the ghost of heraclitus or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3064,8238-274553-0015,this too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3065,8238-274553-0016,lay in that consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self possession,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3066,8238-274553-0017,in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3067,8238-274553-0018,which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3068,8238-274553-0019,the adroitness too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3069,8238-274553-0020,from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual mystific escape,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3070,8238-274553-0021,my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3071,8238-274553-0022,with the memory of the baron ritzner von jung,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3072,8238-274553-0023,lay like an incubus upon the university,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3073,8238-274553-0024,during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3074,8238-274553-0025,and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor an eloquence,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3075,8238-274553-0026,an impressiveness and an affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even myself who well knew him to be at heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3076,8238-274553-0027,a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3077,8238-274553-0028,looking around me during a pause in the baron's discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of coleridge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3078,8238-274553-0029,except perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3079,8238-274553-0030,and i believe for some logical talent as a duellist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3080,8238-274553-0031,but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he rode to the death to ritzner,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3081,8238-274553-0032,ever upon the lookout for the grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification of this however i was not aware,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3082,8238-274553-0033,i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r and giving his reasons in detail,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3083,8238-274553-0034,to these the baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3084,8238-274553-0035,your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3085,8238-274553-0036,i would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman as hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were turned upon the baron,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3086,8238-274553-0037,then excessively red then dropping his pocket handkerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no one else at the table,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3087,8238-274553-0038,it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood erect,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3088,8238-274553-0039,for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadaverously white,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3089,8238-274553-0040,for a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3090,8238-274553-0041,the language you have thought proper to employ,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3091,8238-274553-0042,in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3092,8238-274553-0043,is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3093,8238-274553-0044,you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to consider for an instant,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3094,8238-274553-0045,this being done there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3095,8238-274553-0046,while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite hermann,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3096,8238-274553-0047,striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and ritzner took their departure,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3097,8238-274553-0048,as hermann went out the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3098,8238-274553-0049,and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar character,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3099,8238-274553-0050,after a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello and entertained me for a long time,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3104,8238-274553-0055,from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3106,8238-274553-0057,although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3108,8238-274553-0059,having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which i carried to hermann sir through our common friend mister p i have received your note of this evening,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3109,8238-274553-0060,upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3110,8238-274553-0061,i have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3111,8238-274553-0062,the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient i am assured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3112,8238-274553-0063,to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation with sentiments of profound respect your most obedient servant von jung,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3113,8238-274553-0064,hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self complacency,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3114,8238-274553-0065,et per se having finished reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3115,8238-274553-0066,to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3116,8238-274553-0067,he seemed to receive hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duelli lex scripta et non,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3117,8238-274553-0068,he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my surprise,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3118,8238-274553-0069,he now explained the mystery,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3119,8238-274553-0070,and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3120,8238-274553-0071,when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in hermann's way,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3121,8238-274553-0072,two or three weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3122,8238-274553-0073,and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit upon this hint he proceeded,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3123,8238-274553-0074,hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3124,8238-283452-0000,introduction the humorous ghost is distinctly a modern character in early literature wraiths took themselves very seriously,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3125,8238-283452-0001,and insisted on a proper show of respectful fear on the part of those whom they honored by haunting a mortal was expected to rise when a ghost entered the room and in case he was slow about it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3126,8238-283452-0002,his spine gave notice of what etiquette demanded in the event of outdoor apparition if a man failed to bare his head in awe the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3127,8238-283452-0003,in that her locks being long and pinned up are less easily moved which may explain the fact if it be a fact that in fiction women have shown themselves more self possessed,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3128,8238-283452-0004,while the feminine can be seen through by another woman and thus disarmed the majority of the comic apparitions curiously enough are masculine you don't often find women wraithed in smiles,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3129,8238-283452-0005,and have chivalrously spared the gentler shades and there are very few funny child ghosts you might almost say none in comparison with the number of grown ups,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3130,8238-283452-0006,the number of ghost children of any or all types is small proportionately perhaps because it seems an unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3131,8238-283452-0007,there are a few instances as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later but very few ancient ghosts were a long faced lot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3132,8238-283452-0008,since any living person however senile would be thought juvenile compared with a timeless spook but in these days of individualism and radical liberalism spooks as well as mortals are expanding their personalities,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3133,8238-283452-0009,and indulging in greater freedom a ghost can call his shade his own now and exhibit any mood he pleases even young female wraiths demanding latchkeys refuse to obey the frowning face of the clock,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3134,8238-283452-0010,to make the ghost of missus grundy turn a shade paler in horror nowadays haunters have more fun and freedom than the haunted in fact it's money in one's pocket these days to be dead for ghosts have no rent problems,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3135,8238-283452-0011,manifestly death has compensations not connected with the consolations of religion the marvel is that apparitions were so long in realizing their possibilities in improving their advantages,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3136,8238-283452-0012,the specters in classic and medieval literature were malarial vaporous beings without energy to do anything but threaten,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3137,8238-283452-0013,at best a revenant could only rattle a rusty skeleton or shake a moldy shroud or clank a chain but as mortals cowered before his demonstrations he didn't worry,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3138,8238-283452-0014,the up to date ghost keeps his skeleton in a garage or some place where it is cleaned and oiled and kept in good working order the modern wraith has sold his sheet to the old clo'es man and dresses as in life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3139,8238-283452-0015,he knows that there's no weapon no threat in horror to be compared with ridicule think what a solemn creature the gothic ghost was,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3140,8238-283452-0016,how little originality and initiative he showed and how dependent he was on his own atmosphere for thrills his sole appeal was to the spinal column the ghost of to day touches the funny bone as well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3141,8238-283452-0017,many americans there are to day who would court being haunted by the captain and crew of richard middleton's ghost ship that landed in a turnip field and dispensed drink till they demoralized the denizens of village and graveyard alike,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3142,8238-283452-0018,after that show of spirits the turnips in that field tasted of rum long after the ghost ship had sailed away into the blue the modern spook is possessed not only of humor but of a caustic satire as well,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3143,8238-283452-0019,his jest is likely to have more than one point to it and he can haunt so insidiously can make himself so at home in his host's study or bedroom that a man actually welcomes a chat with him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3144,8238-283452-0020,a ghost moreover that towered and swelled at every hackneyed phrase till finally he filled the room and burst after the young man proposed to his admired one and made subsequent remarks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3145,8238-283452-0021,ghosts not only have appallingly long memories but they possess a mean advantage over the living in that they have once been mortal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3146,8238-283452-0022,the modern humorous ghost satirizes everything from the old fashioned specter he's very fond of taking pot shots at him to the latest psychic manifestations,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3147,8238-283452-0023,he laughs at ghosts that aren't experts in efficiency haunting and he has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of specters he loves to shake the lugubrious terrors of the past before you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3148,8238-283452-0024,and uses the old thrills only to show what dead batteries they come from his really electrical effects are his own inventions he needs no dungeon keeps and monkish cells to play about in not he,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3149,8238-283452-0025,he demands no rag nor bone nor clank of chain of his old equipment to start on his career he can start up a moving picture show of his own as in ruth mc enery stuart's the haunted photograph,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3150,8238-283452-0026,and demonstrate a new kind of apparition the ghost story of to day gives you spinal sensations with a difference as in the immortal transferred ghost by frank r stockton,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3151,8238-283452-0027,where the suitor on the moonlit porch attempting to tell his fair one that he dotes on her sees the ghost of her ferocious uncle who isn't dead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3152,8238-283452-0028,kicking his heels against the railing and hears his admonition that he'd better hurry up as the live uncle is coming in sight,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3153,8238-283452-0029,has never been a ghost nor used a wooden leg but a terrifying leg acy while you do believe in it the new ghost has a more nimble and versatile tongue as well as wit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3154,8238-283452-0030,in the older fiction and drama apparitions spoke seldom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3155,8238-283452-0031,and ghosts like kings in drama were of a dignity and must preserve it in their speech or perhaps the authors were doubtful as to the dialogue of shades,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3156,8238-283452-0032,and compromised on a few stately ejaculations as being safely phantasmal speaking parts but compare that usage with the rude freedom of some modern spooks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3157,8238-283452-0033,think of having always and always to speak a dead language the humorous ghost is not only modern but he is distinctively american there are ghosts of all nationalities naturally,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3158,8238-283452-0034,but the spook that provides a joke on his host or on himself is yankee in origin and development the dry humor the comic sense of the incongruous the willingness to laugh at himself as at others,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3159,8238-283452-0035,and are preserved in their true flavor i don't assert of course,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3160,8238-283452-0036,the french and english selections in this volume are sufficient to prove the contrary,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3161,8238-283452-0037,there are various english stories of whimsical haunting some of actual spooks and some of the hoax type hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in british as in american literature,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3162,8238-283452-0038,of the early specimens of the really amusing ghost that is an actual revenant is the ghost baby in blackwood's which shows originality and humor yet is too diffuse for printing here,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3163,8238-283452-0039,in that we have a conventional young bachelor engaged to a charming girl who is entangled in social complications and made to suffer mental torment because without his consent,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3164,8238-283452-0040,till the phantom couple take a liking to each other and decide to let the living bury their dead this is suggestive of brander matthews's earlier and cleverer story of a spectral courtship in the rival ghosts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3165,8238-283452-0041,medieval and later literature gave us many instances of a love affair or marriage between one spirit and one mortal,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3167,8238-283452-0043,this travesty on the conventional traditions of the wraith is preposterously delightful one of the cleverest ghost stories in our language zangwill has written engagingly of spooks,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3168,8238-283452-0044,frank r stockton gave his to funny spooks with a riotous and laughing pen the spirit in his transferred ghost is impudently deathless and has called up a train of subsequent haunters,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3169,8238-283452-0045,john kendrick bangs has made the darker regions seem comfortable and homelike for us and has created ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward to being one or more,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3184,5456-62014-0012,here the old woman rose and threw on a handful of lightwood which blazed up with a great sputtering and in the strong light she stood before the fire enacting the part of the scared owl for the delighted yet half startled children,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3190,5456-62014-0018,he teck dat time too,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3191,5456-24741-0000,the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3192,5456-24741-0001,proof all the modes in which any given body is affected,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3193,5456-24741-0002,wherefore their idea also necessarily,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3194,5456-24741-0003,therefore the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3195,5456-24741-0004,hence it follows first that the human mind perceives the nature of a variety of bodies together with the nature of its own,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3196,5456-24741-0005,it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3197,5456-24741-0006,in other words it will have the idea which does not exclude but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3198,5456-24741-0007,will regard the external body as actually existing,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3199,5456-24741-0008,corollary the mind is able to regard as present external bodies by which the human body has once been affected even though they be no longer in existence or present,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3200,5456-24741-0009,by which the human body has once been affected be no longer in existence the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3201,5456-24741-0010,note we thus see how it comes about,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3202,5456-24741-0011,the latter indicates rather the disposition of paul's body than the nature of peter and therefore while this disposition of paul's body lasts paul's mind will regard peter as present to itself even though he no longer exists further to retain the usual phraseology,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3203,5456-24741-0012,the modifications of the human body of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us we will call the images of things though they do not recall the figure of things when the mind regards bodies in this fashion we say that it imagines,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3204,5456-24741-0013,looked at in themselves do not contain error the mind does not err in the mere act of imagining but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3205,5456-24741-0014,which association arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications affectiones of the human body i say first it is an association of those ideas only,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3206,5456-24741-0015,ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3207,5456-24741-0016,those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies i say secondly,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3208,5456-24741-0017,in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3209,5456-24741-0018,whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3210,5456-24741-0019,and hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of one thing should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum an apple,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3211,5456-24741-0020,a roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3212,5456-24741-0021,that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3213,5456-24741-0022,or the human mind perceives those modifications,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3214,5456-24741-0023,the human body itself and as actually existing therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3215,5456-24741-0024,following in god in the same manner and being referred to god in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the human body proof,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3216,5456-62043-0000,a bully boat and a brag captain a story of steamboat life on the mississippi by sol smith does any one remember the caravan she was what would now be considered a slow boat then eighteen twenty seven,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3217,5456-62043-0001,she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera her regular trips from new orleans to natchez were usually made in from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3218,5456-62043-0002,a voyage from new orleans to vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the falls louisville i have never learned if she did,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3219,5456-62043-0003,she must have had a time of it it was my fate to take passage in this boat the captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag we had been out a little more than five days,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3220,5456-62043-0004,and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of natchez on the next day our wood was getting low and night coming on the pilot on duty above the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the captain who went it strong on three kings,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3221,5456-62043-0005,sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3222,5456-62043-0006,which he said was situated right round yonder point but muttered the captain i don't much like to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there's no other chance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3223,5456-62043-0007,and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized wood pile hallo colonel how d'ye sell your wood this time a yellow faced old gentleman,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3224,5456-62043-0008,with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of copperas colored linsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3225,5456-62043-0009,and a pipe in his mouth casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening our spring line answered why capting we must charge you three and a quarter this time the d l replied the captain,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3226,5456-62043-0010,what's the odd quarter for i should like to know you only charged me three as i went down why captaing drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of leer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3227,5456-62043-0011,wood's riz since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop going down,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3228,5456-62043-0012,and there's no other woodyard for nine miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fooel why well well interrupted the captain we'll take a few cords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of brag,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3229,5456-62043-0013,in about half an hour we felt the caravan commence paddling again supper was over,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3230,5456-62043-0014,situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3231,5456-62043-0015,how does that wood burn inquired the captain of the mate who was looking on at the game tisn't of much account i reckon answered the mate it's cottonwood and most of it green at that well thompson three aces again stranger,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3232,5456-62043-0016,thompson i say we'd better take three or four cords at the next woodyard it can't be more than six miles from here two aces and a bragger with the age,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3352,1088-134318-0009,bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3353,1088-134318-0010,muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3354,1088-134318-0011,yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3355,1088-134318-0012,yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3356,1088-134318-0013,then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3357,1088-134318-0014,he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3358,1088-134318-0015,fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3359,1088-134318-0016,no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3360,1088-134318-0017,and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial i suppose your cheque will be honoured all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3361,1088-134318-0018,damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3362,1088-134318-0019,always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3363,1088-134318-0020,at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3364,1088-134318-0021,until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3365,1088-129236-0000,every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments each of its joys ripens into a new want nature uncontainable flowing forelooking,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3366,1088-129236-0001,in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one which is the enchantment of human life,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3367,1088-129236-0002,unites him to his race pledges him to the domestic and civic relations carries him with new sympathy into nature enhances the power of the senses opens the imagination adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3368,1088-129236-0003,establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society the natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3369,1088-129236-0004,one must not be too old the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3370,1088-129236-0005,and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable censors i shall appeal to my seniors,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3371,1088-129236-0006,for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3372,1088-129236-0007,glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women upon the universal heart of all and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3373,1088-129236-0008,only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3374,1088-129236-0009,and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3375,1088-129236-0010,which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3376,1088-129236-0011,dwell care and canker and fear with thought with the ideal is immortal hilarity the rose of joy round it all the muses sing but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of to day and yesterday,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3377,1088-129236-0012,the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3378,1088-129236-0013,and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life like any passage betraying affection between two parties perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion and we are no longer strangers,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3379,1088-129236-0014,it is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic the rude village boy teases the girls about the school house door but to day he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3380,1088-129236-0015,he holds her books to help her and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough but one alone distances him,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3381,1088-129236-0016,for persons are love's world and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature aught derogatory to the social instincts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3382,1088-129236-0017,yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3383,1088-129236-0018,that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3384,1088-129236-0019,no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain which created all things anew which was the dawn in him of music poetry and art which made the face of nature radiant with purple light,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3385,1088-129236-0020,the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3386,1088-129236-0021,when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends though best and purest can give him for the figures the motions,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3387,1088-129236-0022,the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enamelled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone where'er thou art,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3388,1088-129236-0023,thy loving heart in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3389,1088-129236-0024,all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3390,1088-129236-0025,the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3391,1088-129236-0026,a midnight bell a passing groan these are the sounds we feed upon behold there in the wood the fine madman he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights he dilates he is twice a man,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3392,1088-129236-0027,he walks with arms akimbo he soliloquizes he accosts the grass and the trees he feels the blood of the violet the clover and the lily in his veins and he talks with the brook that wets his foot,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3393,1088-129236-0028,the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion who cannot write well under any other circumstances,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3394,1088-129236-0029,the like force has the passion over all his nature it expands the sentiment it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3395,1088-129236-0030,into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world so only it have the countenance of the beloved object in giving him to another it still more gives him to himself,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3396,3240-131232-0000,then i think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of mississippi weeks or months before may eleventh eighteen ninety four no i don't look for it and inevitably find it or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up indefinitely,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3397,3240-131232-0001,but may after a while be shaken down by storms,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3398,3240-131232-0002,so then that the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different origins from different worlds perhaps have entered a region of suspension over this earth wafting near each other long duration,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3399,3240-131232-0003,final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance with hail or that hailstones too when large are phenomena of suspension of long duration that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could become so great only in falling from the clouds,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3400,3240-131232-0004,long duration other indications of long duration i think of a region somewhere above this earth's surface in which gravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the distance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3401,3240-131232-0005,quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from a magnet theoretically the attraction of a magnet should decrease with the square of the distance but the falling off is found to be almost abrupt at a short distance,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3402,3240-131232-0006,horses and barns and elephants and flies and dodoes moas and pterodactyls leaves from modern trees and leaves of the carboniferous era all however tending to disintegrate into homogeneous looking muds or dusts,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3403,3240-131232-0007,red or black or yellow treasure troves for the palaeontologists and for the archaeologists accumulations of centuries cyclones of egypt greece and assyria fishes dried and hard there a short time others there long enough to putrefy,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3404,3240-131232-0008,but the omnipresence of heterogeneity or living fishes also ponds of fresh water oceans of salt water as to the law of gravitation i prefer to take one simple stand,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3405,3240-131232-0009,orthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces gravitation is one of these forces all other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness irrespective of distance as well as of attraction,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3406,3240-131232-0010,but newtonian gravitation admits attraction only then newtonian gravitation can be only one third acceptable even to the orthodox or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of forces or still simpler here are the data,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3407,3240-131232-0011,though it harmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary source and of course with other data too is inadequate to account for two peculiarities of the falls of frogs that never has a fall of tadpoles been reported,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3425,3240-131232-0029,rather strictly localized or in a space of two blocks and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found they were crawling on sidewalks in yards and in streets and in masses,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3427,3240-131232-0031,in the streets of memphis january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven why that's sensible that's the common sense that has been against us from the first it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3430,3240-131232-0034,again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3509,3240-131231-0072,the fish were all dead and indeed stiff and hard when picked up immediately after the occurrence by all of which i mean that we have only begun to pile up our data of things that fall from a stationary source overhead,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3510,3240-131231-0073,we'll have to take up the subject from many approaches before our acceptance which seems quite as rigorously arrived at as ever has been a belief can emerge from the accursed i don't know how much the horse and the barn will help us to emerge,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

3520,3240-131231-0083,there must have been very limited selection there is no record of the fall of other objects but there is no attempt in the review to specify a whirlwind these strangely associated things were remarkably separated they fell eight miles apart,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3521,3240-131231-0084,then as if there were real reasoning they must have been high to fall with such divergence or one of them must have been carried partly horizontally eight miles farther than the other but either supposition argues for power more than that of a local whirl or gust,[0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
