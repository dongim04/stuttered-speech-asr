103-1240-0001.flac, that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
103-1240-0002.flac,for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
103-1240-0003.flac, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own
103-1240-0004.flac,but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
103-1240-0005.flac, helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
103-1240-0006.flac, as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
103-1240-0007.flac, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
103-1240-0008.flac,the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
103-1240-0009.flac, missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
103-1240-0011.flac, and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
103-1240-0012.flac, had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
103-1240-0014.flac, and her afternoon's enjoyment adamant was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
103-1240-0015.flac,if he'd run out of turnip's seat he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
103-1240-0016.flac,yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
103-1240-0019.flac, barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
103-1240-0020.flac, bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure
103-1240-0021.flac,they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
103-1240-0022.flac, set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
103-1240-0023.flac,one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
103-1240-0024.flac,or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
103-1240-0025.flac,once you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
103-1240-0026.flac,and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
103-1240-0028.flac, yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
103-1240-0029.flac,how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
103-1240-0030.flac, thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
103-1240-0032.flac, marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
103-1240-0033.flac, matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
103-1240-0034.flac, she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
103-1240-0036.flac, marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
103-1240-0037.flac, what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
103-1240-0038.flac, missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
103-1240-0039.flac, so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
103-1240-0040.flac,there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
103-1240-0041.flac,they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
103-1240-0043.flac, old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
103-1240-0044.flac,so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
103-1240-0045.flac, well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
103-1240-0046.flac, nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
103-1240-0047.flac, and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what
103-1240-0048.flac, this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
103-1240-0049.flac,it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
103-1240-0050.flac, and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
103-1240-0051.flac,only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla
103-1240-0052.flac, as if poisoning welles were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wondered missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she you wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
103-1240-0053.flac, missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
103-1240-0054.flac,and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
103-1240-0055.flac,it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather
103-1240-0056.flac,it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
103-1241-0000.flac,chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
103-1241-0002.flac, matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
103-1241-0003.flac,he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
103-1241-0004.flac, and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
103-1241-0005.flac,he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
103-1241-0006.flac, matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
103-1241-0007.flac, and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
103-1241-0008.flac,the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
103-1241-0009.flac, she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled
103-1241-0010.flac,guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
103-1241-0011.flac, i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain
103-1241-0012.flac,maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
103-1241-0013.flac,and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
103-1241-0014.flac, a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
103-1241-0015.flac,her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
103-1241-0016.flac, might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
103-1241-0017.flac,was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
103-1241-0018.flac, i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
103-1241-0019.flac, i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night
103-1241-0020.flac,i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
103-1241-0021.flac, matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
103-1241-0023.flac,it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
103-1241-0024.flac, we've got to drive a long piece haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough
103-1241-0025.flac,it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
103-1241-0026.flac,they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
103-1241-0028.flac, i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
103-1241-0029.flac,the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
103-1241-0030.flac,isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
103-1241-0031.flac, i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular
103-1241-0032.flac,but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
103-1241-0034.flac, but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagine that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worthwhile
103-1241-0035.flac, and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
103-1241-0036.flac, she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
103-1241-0037.flac, oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
103-1241-0038.flac, and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
103-1241-0039.flac, and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew
103-1241-0041.flac, was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
103-1241-0042.flac,he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different
103-1241-0043.flac,and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
1088-129236-0000.flac, every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments each of its joys ripens into a new want nature uncontainable flowing forelooking
1088-129236-0001.flac, in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one which is the enchantment of human life
1088-129236-0002.flac, unites him to his race pledges him to the domestic and civic relations carries him with new sympathy into nature enhances the power of the senses opens the imagination adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes
1088-129236-0003.flac,establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society the natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience
1088-129236-0004.flac,one must not be too old the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom
1088-129236-0005.flac,and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable censors i shall appeal to my seniors
1088-129236-0006.flac,for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old
1088-129236-0007.flac, glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women upon the universal heart of all and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames
1088-129236-0008.flac,only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden
1088-129236-0009.flac, and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured
1088-129236-0010.flac,which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name
1088-129236-0011.flac,dwell care and canker and fear with thought with the ideal is immortal hilarity the rose of joy round it all the muses sing but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of to day and yesterday
1088-129236-0012.flac,the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment
1088-129236-0013.flac,and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life like any passage betraying affection between two parties perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion and we are no longer strangers
1088-129236-0014.flac,it is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic the rude village boy teases the girls about the school house door but to day he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel
1088-129236-0015.flac,he holds her books to help her and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough but one alone distances him
1088-129236-0016.flac,for persons are love's world and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature aught derogatory to the social instincts
1088-129236-0017.flac,yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience
1088-129236-0018.flac, that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances
1088-129236-0019.flac,no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain which created all things anew which was the dawn in him of music poetry and art which made the face of nature radiant with purple light
1088-129236-0020.flac,the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory
1088-129236-0021.flac,when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends though best and purest can give him for the figures the motions
1088-129236-0022.flac,the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enamelled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone where'er thou art
1088-129236-0023.flac, thy loving heart in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love
1088-129236-0024.flac,all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on
1088-129236-0025.flac,the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes
1088-129236-0026.flac,a midnight bell a passing groan these are the sounds we feed upon behold there in the wood the fine madman he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights he dilates he is twice a man

1088-134315-0006.flac,if he expected her to give him any encouragement to proceed he was disappointed probably he required no such encouragement for in the presence of his social inferiors he was somewhat monopolizing cut a man's flesh and it heals he said
1088-134315-0007.flac,whip a man and the memory of it passes frighten him fill him with a sense of foreboding and apprehension and let him believe that something dreadful is going to happen either to himself or to someone he loves better the latter

1088-134315-0010.flac,what would justify the use of such an awful weapon she asked it is amply justified to secure an end he said blandly for example i want something i cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means
1088-134315-0011.flac,if i can buy it well and good if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me so much the better if i can obtain it by any merit i possess i utilize that merit
1088-134315-0012.flac,providing always that i can secure my object in the time otherwise he shrugged his shoulders i see she said nodding her head quickly i suppose that is how blackmailers feel he frowned
1088-134315-0013.flac,that is a word i never use nor do i like to hear it employed he said blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money
1088-134315-0014.flac, and according to your argument they are also justified it is a matter of plane he said airily viewed from my standpoint they are sordid criminals the sort of person that t x meets i presume in the course of his daily work
1088-134315-0015.flac, t x he went on somewhat oracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
1088-134315-0016.flac,he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person said the girl coldly i am paying you three pounds a week i think he said
1088-134315-0017.flac, i intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably thank you said the girl quietly but i am already being paid quite sufficient she left him a little astonished and not a little ruffled
1088-134315-0018.flac, to refuse the favours of remington kara was by him regarded as something of an affront
1088-134315-0019.flac, he rang the bell this time for his valet fisher he said i am expecting a visit from a gentleman named gathercole a one armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes
1088-134315-0020.flac,detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him
1088-134315-0021.flac,he will probably be interested if you take him into the library very good sir said the urbane fisher will you change before you go out kara shook his head i think i will go as i am he said get me my fur coat this beastly cold kills me
1088-134315-0022.flac,he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street keep my fire going put all my private letters in my bedroom and see that miss holland has her lunch fisher followed him to his car wrapped the fur rug about his legs
1088-134315-0023.flac, close the door carefully and return to the house
1088-134315-0024.flac,that he should return to kara's study and set the papers in order was natural and proper that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers in kara's desk might be excused on the score of diligence since he was to some extent in the confidence of his employer
1088-134315-0025.flac, kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point in his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as fred and on more occasions than one and for no apparent reason had tipped his servant over and above his salary
1088-134315-0026.flac, mister fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon kara's cheque book which told him that on the previous day the greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank
1088-134315-0027.flac,this interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of kara's correspondence
1088-134315-0028.flac,answering letters appealing for charitable donations and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great he replenished the fire asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest
1088-134315-0029.flac,this time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations the safe he did not attempt to touch but there was a small bureau in which kara would have placed his private correspondence of the morning this however yielded no result
1088-134315-0030.flac,rum cove said fisher he paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework he lifted it gingerly
1088-134315-0031.flac,there was a little knob for the purpose and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself rum cove he said again and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up left the room closing the door softly behind him
1088-134315-0032.flac,he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown and began to descend the stairs to the hall he was less than half way down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him there's a gentleman who wants to see mister kara she said here is his card
1088-134315-0033.flac,fisher took the card from the salver and read mister george gathercole junior travellers club i'll see this gentleman he said with a sudden brisk interest he found the visitor standing in the hall
1088-134315-0034.flac,he was a man who would have attracted attention if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance he was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check he had a top hat glossy and obviously new at the back of his head
1088-134315-0035.flac, a pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture fisher who was an observer of some discernment noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit large black boots
1088-134315-0036.flac,and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
1088-134315-0037.flac, either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the other's sleeve and he received a shock for the forearm was clearly an artificial one it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck
1088-134315-0038.flac, and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat where is kara growled the stranger
1088-134315-0039.flac, he told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently what dog am i that i should wait till six
1088-134315-0040.flac,six o'clock eh you will tell mister kara that i called give me those books but i assure you sir stammered fisher give me those books roared the other
1088-134315-0041.flac,deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket crooked the elbow by some quick manipulation and thrust the books which the valet most reluctantly handed to him back to the place from whence he had taken them tell mister kara i will call at my own time
1088-134315-0042.flac, good morning to you if you would only wait sir pleaded the agonized fisher wait be hanged snarled the other i've waited three years i tell you tell mister kara to expect me when he sees me he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him
1088-134315-0043.flac,fisher went back to the library the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up i am afraid miss holland i've got myself into very serious trouble what is that fisher asked the girl
1088-134315-0044.flac, mister gathercole said the girl quickly fisher nodded yes miss i couldn't get him to stay though she pursed her lips thoughtfully mister kara will be very cross but i don't see how you can help it i wish you had called me
1088-134315-0045.flac,at six o'clock miss the man replied there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered shall i ring up for a messenger no i don't think that would be advisable you had better take it yourself
1088-134315-0046.flac,she handed him the letter and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription
1088-134315-0047.flac,special service department scotland yard whitehall he put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change large as the house was kara did not employ a regular staff of servants a maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff
1088-134315-0048.flac,the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid serving maid and housekeeper in one miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon
1088-134315-0049.flac,but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her she heard the soft thud of the front door closing and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street she watched fisher until he was out of sight
1088-134315-0050.flac,the maid who was also cook arose up as the girl entered it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen miss she smiled i'm afraid you're rather lonely missus beale said the girl sympathetically lonely miss cried the maid
1088-134315-0051.flac, i fairly get the creeps sitting here hour after hour it's that door that gives me the hump she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood that's mister kara's wine cellar nobody's been in it but him
1088-134315-0052.flac, i know he goes in sometimes because i tried a dodge that my brother who's a policeman taught me i stretched a bit of white cotton across it an it was broke the next morning mister kara keeps some of his private papers in there said the girl quietly he has told me so himself
1088-134315-0053.flac, said the woman doubtfully i wish he'd brick it up the same as he has the lower cellar i get the horrors sittin here at night expectin the door to open an the ghost of the mad lord to come out him that was killed in africa miss holland laughed i want you to go out now she said
1088-134315-0054.flac,the girl ascended to the upper floor again she watched from the window the disappearing figure once out of sight miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness from her bag she produced a small purse and opened it
1088-134315-0055.flac, in that case was a new steel key
1088-134315-0056.flac,in two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents it was a large safe of the usual type there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box
1088-134315-0057.flac, an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected she returned the papers to the drawer pushed it to and locked it she gave her attention to the second drawer her hand shook a little as she pulled it open
1088-134315-0058.flac,it was a square case covered in red morocco leather she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry at last she said aloud and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face
1088-134318-0000.flac,chapter twelve kara lay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
1088-134318-0001.flac, it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasant's cabin on the hillside outside durazzo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kara's whim all that life held for a man
1088-134318-0002.flac,to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
1088-134318-0003.flac,to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
1088-134318-0004.flac,he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
1088-134318-0005.flac,he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pezara and
1088-134318-0006.flac,had t x returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions
1088-134318-0007.flac,kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
1088-134318-0008.flac,yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock
1088-134318-0009.flac, bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway
1088-134318-0010.flac, muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
1088-134318-0011.flac, yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
1088-134318-0012.flac, yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor
1088-134318-0013.flac,then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
1088-134318-0014.flac,he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
1088-134318-0015.flac, fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
1088-134318-0016.flac,no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
1088-134318-0017.flac,and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial i suppose your cheque will be honoured all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
1088-134318-0018.flac,damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
1088-134318-0019.flac, always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you
1088-134318-0020.flac,at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
1088-134318-0021.flac,until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
1502-122615-0000.flac,pope's iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear the hurons are dogs
1502-122615-0001.flac,the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior tremble the gray head and the sagamore are safe
1502-122615-0002.flac,go uncas and the open hand are now strangers it is enough
1502-122615-0003.flac,but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh
1502-122615-0004.flac,the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the lodge and exhibited the figure of uncas
1502-122615-0005.flac,after this termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran
1502-122615-0006.flac,he retraced his steps to the council lodge resolved to seek and question david in order to put an end to his doubts on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution
1502-122615-0007.flac,though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far the terrible scene that had just occurred
1502-122615-0008.flac, proved favorable to his views and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage without seeming to hesitate
1502-122615-0009.flac,he walked into the lodge and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that though uncas still remained where he had left him
1502-122615-0010.flac, david had not reappeared no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway
1502-122615-0011.flac,in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition
1502-122615-0012.flac,he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent resolution his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed
1502-122615-0013.flac,he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him my canada father does not forget his children said the chief
1502-122615-0014.flac,i thank him an evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men can the cunning stranger frighten him away heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the indians
1502-122615-0015.flac,in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal
1502-122615-0016.flac, that would have given him more satisfaction aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character however he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery spirits differ
1502-122615-0017.flac,the huron was content with the assurance and resuming his pipe he awaited the proper moment to move the impatient heyward inwardly execrating the cold customs of the savages
1502-122615-0018.flac,equal to that maintained by the chief who was in truth a near relative of the afflicted woman the minutes lingered and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in empiricism when the huron laid aside his pipe
1502-122615-0019.flac,and drew his robe across his breast as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid just then a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door and stalking silently among the attentive group
1502-122615-0020.flac,he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua
1502-122615-0021.flac, several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again
1502-122615-0022.flac, drew his tomahawk from his girdle and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle
1502-122615-0023.flac, ten minutes which appeared so many ages to duncan might have passed in this manner and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke
1502-122615-0024.flac,has my friend found the moose the young men stagger under their burdens returned magua let reed that bends go on the hunting path he will meet them a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name
1502-122615-0025.flac,as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant the smoke wreathed above their heads in little eddies
1502-122615-0026.flac, leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes
1502-122615-0027.flac,the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth
1502-122615-0028.flac, suffer their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white headed savage
1502-122615-0029.flac, like most around him for more than a minute his look too was on the ground but trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention
1502-122615-0030.flac,then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence it was a lie he said i had no son he who was called by that name is forgotten
1502-122615-0031.flac,the wicked chippewas cheated my squaw
1502-122615-0032.flac,he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself i have done the speaker who was the father of the recreant young indian looked round and about him
1502-122615-0033.flac,the expression of his eye contradicted his figurative and boastful language
1502-122615-0034.flac,standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as if sickening at the gaze of men and veiling his face in his blanket he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking
1502-122615-0035.flac, in the privacy of his own abode the sympathy of one like himself aged forlorn and childless the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects in character
1502-122615-0036.flac, suffered him to depart in silence then with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men
1502-122615-0037.flac,but who has ever found a huron asleep the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed the delawares of the lakes
1502-122615-0038.flac, not so they who wear the petticoats of squaws on their own river one of them has been passing the tribe did my young men take his scalp
1502-122619-0000.flac,brief i pray for you for you see tis a busy time with me much ado about nothing the tribe or rather half tribe of delawares
1502-122619-0001.flac, could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks
1502-122619-0002.flac,though they had seen fit with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of their ally
1502-122619-0003.flac, in various ways it was the prevalent opinion however
1502-122619-0004.flac, that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity
1502-122619-0005.flac,that their hatchets were dull and time was necessary to sharpen them the politic captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy
1502-122619-0006.flac,on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people
1502-122619-0007.flac,the women ran from lodge to lodge
1502-122619-0008.flac,a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends the warriors were lounging in groups
1502-122619-0009.flac,the instruments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges but none departed here and there a warrior was examining his arms with an attention that is rarely bestowed on the implements
1502-122619-0010.flac,when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously
1502-122619-0011.flac, as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village
1502-122619-0012.flac,he was without arms and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance when in full view of the delawares he stopped and made a gesture of amity
1502-122619-0013.flac, by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall impressively on his breast
1502-122619-0014.flac, fortified by these assurances the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace
1502-122619-0015.flac,he made as he advanced many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice the women however like one who deemed their favor in the present enterprise of no importance
1502-122619-0016.flac,his reception was grave silent and wary the warriors in front stepped aside opening the way to their most approved orator by the action
1502-122619-0017.flac,one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines the wise huron is welcome said the delaware
1502-122619-0018.flac, composed of cracked corn and beans it is much used also by the whites by corn is meant maise
1502-122619-0019.flac,he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist they once more exchanged friendly salutations
1502-122619-0020.flac,then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge and share his morning meal the invitation was accepted and the two warriors attended by three or four of the old men walked calmly away
1502-122619-0021.flac, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short and frugal repast that followed
1502-122619-0022.flac, and related entirely to the events of the hunt in which magua had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts
1502-122619-0023.flac,notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware
1502-122619-0024.flac,is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children
1502-122619-0025.flac,when was it ever otherwise returned magua he calls my people most beloved the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued
1502-122619-0026.flac,the tomahawks of your young men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yengeese are dead and the delawares are our neighbors
1502-122619-0027.flac,the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand and remained silent then magua as if recalled to such a recollection by the allusion to the massacre demanded
1502-122619-0028.flac,does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open let her be sent to my squaws if she gives trouble to my brother
1502-122619-0029.flac,she is welcome returned the chief of the latter nation still more emphatically the baffled magua continued silent several minutes apparently indifferent however to the repulse he had received
1502-122619-0030.flac,and this his opening effort to regain position of corra do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their huns he at length continued
1502-122619-0031.flac, it is well justice is the master of a red skin why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers
1502-122619-0032.flac, good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time
1502-122619-0033.flac,to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares before he added have there not been strange moccasins in the woods have not my brothers scented the feet of white men
1502-122619-0034.flac,let my canada father come returned the other evasively his children are ready to see him when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams the hurons say too he is welcome
1502-122619-0035.flac,but the yengeese have long arms and legs that never tire
1502-122619-0036.flac,it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said magua once more shifting his ground
1502-122619-0037.flac, and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry
1502-122619-0038.flac,in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors one of whom was his host he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors
1502-122619-0039.flac,compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity
1502-122619-0040.flac,so aptly mingled with praise in the eyes of those he addressed this well judged and politic stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results
1502-122619-0041.flac,my brother is a wise chief he is welcome the hurons love their friends the delawares returned magua why should they not they are colored by the same sun and their just men will hunt in the same grounds after death
1502-122619-0042.flac,the red skins should be friends and look with open eyes on the white men has not my brother scented spies in the woods the delaware whose name in english signified hard heart
1502-122619-0043.flac, an appellation that the french had translated into le coeur dur forgot that obduracy of purpose
1502-122619-0044.flac,would the yengeese send their women as spies did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle he told no lie the yengeese have sent out their scouts
1502-122619-0045.flac,then they fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends their minds are turned from their canada father this insinuation was a home thrust
1502-122619-0046.flac, would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist the recent defection of the tribe had as they well knew themselves subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies
1502-122619-0047.flac,and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee
1502-122619-0048.flac, that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements their distant villages their hunting grounds
1502-122619-0049.flac, together with a material part of their physical force were actually within the limits of the french territory accordingly this alarming annunciation was received as magua intended
1502-122619-0050.flac, with manifest disapprobation if not with alarm
1502-122619-0051.flac,he will see no change it is true my young men did not go out on the war path they had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white chief
1502-122619-0052.flac, will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the camp of his children
1502-122619-0053.flac,that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delawares go my great canada father is not a fool
1502-122619-0054.flac,la longue carabine the delaware warriors started at the well known name betraying by their amazement that they now learned for the first time one so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power
1502-122619-0055.flac,what does my brother mean demanded le coeur dur in a tone that by its wonder far exceeded the usual apathy of his race a huron never lies returned magua coldly
1502-122619-0056.flac,a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in
1502-122619-0057.flac,the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated the women suspended their labors to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors
1502-122619-0058.flac,the boys deserted their sports and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the temerity of their hated foe
1502-122619-0059.flac,in short every occupation was abandoned for the time and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge after their own peculiar manner in an open expression of feeling
1502-122619-0060.flac,the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment
1502-122619-0061.flac, magua had not only maintained his seat but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge
1502-122619-0062.flac, and apparently as unconcerned as if he had no interest in the result
1502-122619-0063.flac, escaped his vigilant eyes
1502-122619-0064.flac,he anticipated every measure on which they decided and it might almost be said
1502-122619-0065.flac,and formal assemblage of the nation as such meetings were rare and only called on occasions of the last importance the subtle huron who still sat apart
1502-122619-0066.flac,now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue
1502-122619-0067.flac, in front of the encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect it might have been half an hour before each individual including even the women and children was in his place
1502-122619-0068.flac,the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain
1502-122619-0069.flac,its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls
1502-122619-0070.flac,standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious discussion
1502-122619-0071.flac,until such a one chose to make some movement no deeds in arms no natural gifts nor any renown as an orator
1502-122619-0072.flac, on the present occasion the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak was silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause
1502-122619-0073.flac, that always preceded a conference but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally an eye was raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
1502-122619-0074.flac,and three men issuing from it slowly approached the place of consultation they were all aged even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached but one in the center who leaned on his companions for support
1502-122619-0075.flac,had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain his frame which had once been tall and erect like the cedar was now bending under the pressure of more than a century
1502-122619-0076.flac,the elastic light step of an indian was gone and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground
1502-122619-0077.flac,his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders
1502-122619-0078.flac,since they had last been shorn the dress of this patriarch for such considering his vast age in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people he might very properly be termed
1502-122619-0079.flac,was rich and imposing though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe his robe was of the finest skins which had been deprived of their fur
1502-122619-0080.flac, of various deeds in arms done in former ages his bosom was loaded with medals some in massive silver and one or two even in gold
1502-122619-0081.flac,he also wore armlets and cinctures above the ankles of the latter precious metal
1502-122619-0082.flac, in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks his tomahawk was nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure
1502-122619-0083.flac, which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided
1502-122619-0084.flac, was whispered from mouth to mouth magua had often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware
1502-122619-0085.flac, with the great spirit and which has since transmitted his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his ancient territory
1502-122619-0086.flac,the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out a little from the throng
1502-122619-0087.flac, whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes
1502-122619-0088.flac,the americans sometimes called their tutelar saint tamenay a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced
1502-122619-0089.flac,the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions
1502-122619-0090.flac,with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father
1502-122619-0091.flac,who belongs rather to another world than to this was received by his people after a suitable and decent pause
1502-122619-0092.flac, and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person
1502-122619-0093.flac,so just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness
1502-122619-0094.flac, the chiefs drew back again to their several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment
1502-122619-0095.flac, arose left the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning
1502-122619-0096.flac,escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment the crowd opened in a lane and when the party had re entered
198-126831-0000.flac, friday was a comfortable day in the household of king everybody was in good humour the story girl sparkled through several tales that ranged from the afrites and jinns of eastern myth through the piping days of chivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlisle workaday folks
198-126831-0001.flac,she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silk envelope the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of palestine disguised as a page gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a caronso
198-126831-0002.flac,with a highwayman on a moonlit heath and buskirk's girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated
198-126831-0003.flac,cessily and sara ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine
198-126831-0004.flac,chancing accidentally i vow to overhear certain of these secrets i learned that sara ray had named an apple for johnny price and cecily true's you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love
198-126831-0005.flac,while cecily admitted that willy fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her if you love me as i love you no knife can cut our love in two but sara ray never you breathe this to a living soul
198-126831-0006.flac,cecily how old must we be before we can have a real beau but sara always denied it so i am inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself paddy distinguished himself by catching a rat
198-126831-0007.flac,and being intolerably conceited about it until sara ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears then pat sneaked abjectly off his tail drooping
198-126831-0008.flac,very few cats have and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon pettie had a finer taste the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking
198-126831-0009.flac,the story girl would box his ears with her fist and say bless your gray heart paddy you're a good sort of old rascal and pat would purr his satisfaction i used to take a handful of the skin on his back shake him gently and say
198-126831-0010.flac,pat you've forgotten more than any human being ever knew and i vow paddy would lick his chops with delight but to be called a sweet cat oh sara sara
198-126831-0011.flac, felicity tried and had the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe a gorgeous compound
198-126831-0012.flac,the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked aunt janet's thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse uncle roger ate three slices of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist
198-126831-0013.flac,the poor man meant it as a compliment but felicity who knew uncle blare was an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasn't
198-126831-0014.flac, i'd like to sighed too sighed felicity but we'd come home tired and with all the milking to do you boys better go alone peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger you can all go
198-126831-0015.flac, i have an idea that a raspberry pie for to morrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her
198-126831-0016.flac, a pretty walk through a world of green whispering boughs and spice sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight the raspberries were plentiful
198-126831-0017.flac, then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies and the story girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glen where a fair white lady dwelt
198-126831-0018.flac, who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright and if you drank of the cup with her said the story girl her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us you were never seen in the world again you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with a fairy bride
198-126831-0019.flac, i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward said the story girl dreamily and i think there is a way of getting there too if we could only find it
198-126831-0020.flac,one bitter day when they seek it
198-126831-0021.flac,and that is the tragedy of life on that day the gates of edan are shut behind them and age of gold is over henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again
198-126831-0022.flac,they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles the world calls them its singers and poets and artists and story tellers
198-126831-0023.flac,as we sat there the awkward man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side he did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods
198-126831-0024.flac,he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed the story girl kissed her fingertips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her
198-126831-0025.flac, you'd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him they say it's pitiful to see him i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl
198-126831-0026.flac, if i put it off any longer it will be too late i'm growing so fast aunt olivia says i'll have to wear ankle skirts next summer if i begin to look grown up he'll get frightened of me and then i'll never find out the golden milestone mystery
198-126831-0027.flac, do you think he'll ever tell you who alice is i asked i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature but she would tell us nothing more when the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward
198-126831-0028.flac, and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights off to the west was the dothel dole glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets
198-126831-0029.flac, and i got back about fifteen minutes ago i set down on the front door steps for a moment and all at once i heard a bell ringing in the house eight times i tell you i was scared i made a bolt for the orchard and you won't catch me going near the house to your uncle roger comes home
198-126831-0030.flac,there we stood in a huddle demoralized group oh what an eerie place that orchard was what shadows what noises
198-126831-0031.flac, well here's the key go and see for yourself said peter felicity had no intention of going and seeing i think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex you ought to be braver than girls
198-126831-0032.flac, somebody killed or something like that you know nothing like that ever happened in our family the kings have always been respectable perhaps it is emily
198-126831-0033.flac, king's ghost whispered phelix she never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the story girl oh oh children isn't there something under uncle alice tree we peered fearfully through the gloom there was something something that wavered and fluttered advanced retreated
198-126831-0034.flac, that's only my old apron said felicity i hung it there to day when i was looking for that white hen's nest oh what shall we do uncle roger may not be back for hours i can't believe there's anything in the house maybe it's only peg bowen suggested dan
198-126831-0035.flac, there was not a great deal of comfort in this we were almost as much afraid of peg bowen as we would be of any spectral visitant peter scoffed at the idea peg bowen wasn't in the house before your uncle roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards he said
198-126831-0036.flac,no it isn't peg bowen it's something that walks i know a story about a ghost said the story girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes
198-126831-0037.flac, don't cried cecily hysterically don't you go on don't you say another word i can't bear it don't you the story girl didn't but she had said enough
198-126831-0038.flac, all at once something leaped from the bow of a tree and alighted before us we split the air with the simultaneously shriek
198-126831-0039.flac,he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps
198-126831-0040.flac, he was a strange fruit of animal a questing beast presently the moon rose but this only made matters worse the shadows had been still before now they moved entanced as the night wind tossed the bows the old house with its dreadful secret
198-126831-0041.flac,was white and clear against the dark background of spruces we were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew the family ghost only appears in daylight said the story girl
198-126831-0042.flac,i know he'll laugh at us awful but it's better to be laughed at than scared like this uncle roger did not come until nearly ten never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in the lane
198-126831-0043.flac, we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door he stared at us in the moonlight
198-126831-0044.flac, there's no use asking the meaning of this i suppose said uncle roger with the calm of despair i've gave up trying to fathom you young ones peter where's the key what yarn have you been telling
198-126831-0045.flac, uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door as he did so clear and sweet rang out ten bell like chimes
198-126831-0046.flac,we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation we thought he never would stop
198-126831-0047.flac, and now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn
198-126831-0048.flac, i was so frightened i wouldn't mind if he'd laugh once and have it done with it
198-126831-0049.flac, i shall tell it too i don't care if the joke is as much on myself as any one a story is a story no matter who it's on but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown ups always do it i never will when i'm grown up i'll remember better
198-126831-0050.flac,it's all peter's fault said felicity i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing
198-126831-0051.flac,it don't sound a bit like other clocks
198-126831-0052.flac, i wouldn't have said the story girl honestly i thought it was a bell when i heard it and the door opened too let us be fair felicity
198-126831-0053.flac,but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that the best sauce were full of peace
198-129977-0000.flac, eleanor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction
198-129977-0001.flac, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring
198-129977-0002.flac,but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one
198-129977-0003.flac,he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlor dro open
198-129977-0004.flac,as you are not yet ready for breakfast
198-129977-0005.flac,this was a subject which ensured marianne's attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes
198-129977-0006.flac,when edward interrupted her by saying you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars
198-129977-0007.flac,which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country
198-129977-0008.flac, the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber
198-129977-0009.flac, i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
198-129977-0010.flac, i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel
198-129977-0011.flac,and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery
198-129977-0012.flac, is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself
198-129977-0013.flac,because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning unconvinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel
198-129977-0014.flac, but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing
198-129977-0015.flac, i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower
198-129977-0016.flac, marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister
198-129977-0017.flac, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention she was sitting by edward and then taking his tea from missus dashwood his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plate of hair in the center very conspicuous on one of his fingers
198-129977-0018.flac,but i should have thought her hair had been darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his
198-129977-0019.flac, he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister's hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise
198-129977-0020.flac,that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself
198-129977-0021.flac,she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt
198-129977-0022.flac,that it was exactly the shade of her own edward's embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said
198-129977-0023.flac,before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and missus jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest with the assistance of his mother in law sir john was not long in discovering
198-129977-0024.flac, that the name of ferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung
198-129977-0025.flac, but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on market's instruction extended sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to sign in the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening
198-129977-0026.flac,on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both you must drink tea with us to night said he
198-129977-0027.flac, missus jennings enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she and that will tempt you miss marianne a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure
198-129977-0028.flac, what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again this and marianne's blushing gave new suspicions to edward
198-129977-0029.flac,and who is willoughby said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting she gave him a brief reply
198-129977-0030.flac, edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
198-129977-0031.flac,what do you mean shall i tell you certainly well then i guess that mister willoughby hunts marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment's silence said
198-129977-0032.flac, hope i am sure you will like him
198-209-0000.flac, missus allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
198-209-0001.flac, catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilney's lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house
198-209-0002.flac,and missus allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful to milsom street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven
198-209-0003.flac, tripping lightly through the church yard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number
198-209-0004.flac, and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said that he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home and too much offended to admit her
198-209-0005.flac,and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there
198-209-0006.flac,at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom kathron believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgreens buildings
198-209-0007.flac, catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness
198-209-0008.flac, to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety leave nor to what rigors of ruinus in retrain it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbold she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night
198-209-0009.flac,for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second
198-209-0010.flac,to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilney's appeared to play or police her she feared that amongst the many perfection of the family a fondness replace was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage
198-209-0011.flac,on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mister henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention
198-209-0012.flac,every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play
198-209-0013.flac,his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes
198-209-0014.flac, and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence
198-209-0015.flac,to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct
198-209-0016.flac,or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat but his father remained
198-209-0017.flac,and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared
198-209-0018.flac, you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it missus allen did not they tell me that mister tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you
198-209-0019.flac,my dear you tumble my gown was missus allen's reply her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance
198-209-0020.flac,and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
198-209-0021.flac, but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mister thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now missus allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mister thorpe would only have stopped
198-209-0022.flac,i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sister's concern regret
198-209-0023.flac, and dependence on catherine's honour oh do not say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted
198-209-0024.flac,perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father
198-209-0025.flac,and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you
198-209-0026.flac, and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mister tilney
198-209-0027.flac,why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence me i take offence
198-209-0028.flac,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time
198-209-0029.flac, and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box
198-209-0030.flac,she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other
198-209-0031.flac, was engaged in conversation with general tilney
198-209-0032.flac,what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mister thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry
198-209-0033.flac, as she pointed them out to her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man
198-209-0034.flac,when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had traveled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking
198-209-0035.flac, in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with general tilney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you
198-209-0036.flac,no him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first
198-209-0037.flac,the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew
198-209-0038.flac, lowering his voice well done general said i i am quite of your mind
2007-132570-0000.flac,what were they disputing then said emily no ma'amselle nor fighting but almost as good for i believe there was not one of the signors sober
2007-132570-0001.flac, and what is more not one of those fine ladies sober either i thought when i saw them first that all those fine silks and fine veils why ma'amselle their veils were worked with silver
2007-132570-0002.flac, and fine trimmings boded no good i guessed what they were good god exclaimed emily what will become of me
2007-132570-0003.flac, if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken signors
2007-132570-0004.flac, and across the great hall and up the marble stair case and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle and i am in the corridor in a minute are you so says he and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way
2007-132570-0005.flac, well says i if you think there is danger then go with me and guard me i am never afraid when you are by what says he when i am scarcely recovered of one wound shall i put myself in the way of getting another
2007-132570-0006.flac,no no says he i will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage and up the marble stair case and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle for you shall stay here annette you shall not go out of this room to night so
2007-132570-0007.flac, well well said emily impatiently and anxious to inquire on another subject
2007-132570-0008.flac, yes he did indeed ma'amselle notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary
2007-132570-0009.flac, and he mistook ludovico's hall for old carlo's
2007-132570-0010.flac,so we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room but the signor was as cunning as the best of us and kept calling out at the door
2007-132570-0011.flac,come forth my valorous signor steward just then old carlo opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand for as soon as the signor saw him
2007-132570-0012.flac, he was as tame as could be and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his basket all this i saw through the key hole well annette said ludovico jeeringly shall i let you out now
2007-132570-0013.flac, interrupted emily quite wearied by this story do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice
2007-132570-0014.flac,but it is expected back to night or to morrow and i shall know then perhaps emily enquired if she had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners ah ma'amselle said annette archly
2007-132570-0015.flac,now i dare say you are thinking of monsieur valancourt and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state and that he has met with some of our people and is taken captive
2007-132570-0016.flac, oh lord how glad i should be if it was so would you indeed be glad said emily in a tone of mournful reproach to be sure i should
2007-132570-0017.flac, ma'am replied annette and would not you be glad too to see signor valancourt i don't know any chevalier i like better i have a very great regard for the signor truly
2007-132570-0018.flac,you regard for him cannot be doubted said emily since you wished to see him a prisoner why no ma'amselle not a prisoner either but one must be glad to see him you know and it was only the other night i dreamt
2007-132570-0019.flac, and then it was gone and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls so they helped one another up again as fast as they could you would not believe ma'amselle though i shewed you the very cannon where it used to appear
2007-132570-0020.flac, and are you indeed so simple annette said emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories credit them ma'amselle why
2007-132570-0021.flac, all the world could not persuade me out of them reberto and subation in half a dozen more of them went into fits to be sure there was no occasion for that i said myself there was no need of that
2007-132570-0022.flac,for says i when the enemy comes what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down in fits all of a row the enemy won't be so civil perhaps as to walk off like the ghost and leave them to help one another up
2007-132570-0023.flac,but will fall too cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men no no says i there is reason in all things
2007-132570-0024.flac,being because it is no business of mine to look gruff and fight battles emily endeavoured to correct the superstitious weakness of annette though she could not entirely subdue her own to which the latter only replied
2007-132570-0025.flac, nay ma'amselle you will believe nothing you are almost as bad as the signor himself who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret this was a hard
2007-132570-0026.flac,but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so than you have ma'am emily looked displeased and made no reply as she mused upon the recollected appearance which had lately so much alarmed her and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself
2007-132570-0027.flac, opposite to her casement she was for a moment inclined to believe it was valancourt whom she had seen yet if it was he why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so and if he was a prisoner in the castle
2007-132570-0028.flac, and he could be here in no other character how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart
2007-132570-0029.flac, were the same or if they were whether this was valancourt she however desired that annette would endeavour to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names oh dear ma'amselle said annette i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about
2007-132570-0030.flac,the ladies as they call themselves who are lately come to udolpho why that signora livona that the signor brought to see my late lady at venice is his mistress now and was little better then i dare say and ludovico says
2007-132570-0031.flac, but pray be secret ma'am that his excellenza introduced her only to impose upon the world that had begun to make free with her character so when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal
2007-132570-0032.flac,but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady's death too
2007-132570-0033.flac,but she cannot hear them now poor soul said i emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desire to net to go and make inquiry concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle
2007-132570-0034.flac,but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name or that of monsieur valancourt now i think of it ma'amselle said annette i do believe there are prisoners for i overheard one of the signor's men yesterday
2007-132570-0035.flac, and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellency to catch up men and they were as good booties any other because of the ransoms
2007-132570-0036.flac,because said he we don't go shares there this information heightened emily's impatience to know more and annette immediately departed on her inquiry the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations
2007-132570-0037.flac,the possibility that valancourt was near her revived her fortitude and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoni requiring her attendance in the cedar parlour
2007-132570-0038.flac, which she obeyed with trembling and on her way thither endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of valancourt montoni was alone i sent for you said he to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions
2007-132570-0039.flac,i will condescend to advise where i may command
2007-132570-0040.flac,if i have no right in these estates sir said emily of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them if the lands are yours by law you certainly may possess them without my interference or my consent
2007-132570-0041.flac, i will have no more argument said montoni with a look that made her tremble what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby but i will be trifled with no longer
2007-132570-0042.flac,let the recollection of your aunt's sufferings in consequence of her folly and obstinacy teach you a lesson sign the papers emily's resolution was for a moment awed she shrunk at the recollections he revived
2007-132570-0043.flac,and from the vengeance he threatened but then the image of valancourt who so long had loved her and who was now perhaps so near her came to her heart and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always
2007-132570-0044.flac,from her infancy regarded an act of injustice inspired her with a noble though imprudent courage sign the papers said montoni more impatiently than before never sir
2007-132570-0045.flac, replied emily that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right montoni turned pale with anger while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech
2007-132570-0046.flac,then all my vengeance falls upon you he exclaimed with an horrible oath and think not it shall be delayed
2007-132570-0047.flac, you have dared to question my right now dare to question my power i have a punishment which you think not of it is terrible this night this very night this
2007-132570-0048.flac, night repeated another voice montoni paused and turned half round but seeming to recollect himself he proceeded in a lower tone you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly
2007-132570-0049.flac,yet this it appears has not been sufficient to detour you
2007-132570-0050.flac,i could make you tremble at the bareest sidle he was interrupted by a groan which seemed rise from underneath the chamber they were in and as he threw a glance round it impatience and rage flashed from his eyes
2007-132570-0051.flac,yet something like a shade of fear passed over his countenance emily sat down in a chair near the door for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her but montoni paused scarcely an instant and commanding his features
2007-132570-0052.flac, resumed his discourse in a lower yet sterner voice i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me
2007-132570-0053.flac, i could tell you that when once my resolution is taken but i am talking to a baby let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples i could recite the recital could not now benefit you
2007-132570-0054.flac,for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition it would not now appease my indignation i will have vengeance as well as justice another groan filled the pause which montoni made
2007-132570-0055.flac, leave the room instantly said he seeming not to notice this strange occurrence without power to implore his pity she rose to go but found that she could not support herself awe and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair
2007-132570-0056.flac, quit my presence cried montoni this affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation did you hear nothing signor said emily trembling and still unable to leave the room
2007-132570-0057.flac,i heard my own voice rejoined montoni sternly and nothing else
2007-132570-0058.flac, obey my order repeated montoni and for these fool's tricks i will soon discover by whom they are practised emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her
2007-132570-0059.flac,but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence passed to the ramparts as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement emily saw a party of montoni's troops winding down a distant mountain
2007-132570-0060.flac, whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were perhaps bringing to the castle at length having reached her apartment she threw herself upon the couch overcome with the new horrors of her situation
2007-149877-0000.flac, on this particular evening he dined at rector's a restaurant of some local fame which occupied a basement at clark and monroe streets thereafter he visited the resort of fitzgerald and moy's in adams street opposite the imposing federal building
2007-149877-0001.flac,there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars one of which he lighted this to him represented in part high life a fair sample of what the whole must be
2007-149877-0002.flac, drouet was not a drinker in excess he was not a moneyed man he only craved the best as his mind conceived it and such doing seemed him a part of the best
2007-149877-0003.flac, rector's with its polished marble walls and floor its profusion of lights its show of china and silverware and above all its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go
2007-149877-0004.flac,he loved fine clothes good eating and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men when dining it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that joseph jefferson was wont to come to this same place
2007-149877-0005.flac,or that henry e dixie a well known performer of the day was then only a few tables off at rector's he could always obtain this satisfaction for there one could encounter politicians brokers actors
2007-149877-0006.flac, some rich young rounders of the town all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation that's so and so over there was a common remark of these gentlemen among themselves
2007-149877-0007.flac, particularly among those who had not yet reached but hoped to do so the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented you don't say so would be the reply why
2007-149877-0008.flac,why he's manager of the grand opera house when these things would fall upon drouet's ears he would straighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort if he had any vanity this augmented it
2007-149877-0009.flac,the floors were of brightly coloured tiles the walls a composition of rich dark polished wood which reflected the light and coloured stucco work which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance
2007-149877-0010.flac,the long bar was a blaze of lights polished wood work coloured and cut glassware and many fancy bottles
2007-149877-0011.flac, with rich screens fancy wines and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country at rector's drouet had met mister g w hurstwood manager of fitzgerald and moy's
2007-149877-0012.flac,he had been pointed out as a very successful and well known man about town hurstwood looked the part for besides being slightly under forty he had a good stout constitution an active manner and a solid substantial air
2007-149877-0013.flac, which was composed in part of his fine clothes his clean linen his jewels and above all his own sense of his importance drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing
2007-149877-0014.flac, and was glad not only to meet him but to visit the adams street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind he was shrewd and clever in many little things
2007-149877-0015.flac, and capable of creating a good impression his managerial position was fairly important a kind of stewardship which was imposing but lacked financial control he had risen by perseverance and industry
2007-149877-0016.flac,the chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the owners
2007-149877-0017.flac,and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in for the most part he lounged about dressed in excellent tailored suits of imported goods a solitaire ring a fine blue diamond in his tie a striking vest of some new pattern
2007-149877-0018.flac, and a watch chain of solid gold which held a charm of rich design and a watch of the latest make and engraving he knew by name and could greet personally with a well old fellow
2007-149877-0019.flac, hundreds of actors merchants politicians and the general run of successful characters about town and it was part of his success to do so he had a finely graduated scale of informalty and friendship which improved from that how do you do
2007-149877-0020.flac,who by long frequenting of the place became aware of his position to the why old man how are you which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly there was a class however
2007-149877-0021.flac, too rich too famous or too successful with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address and with these he was professionally tactful assuming a grave and dignified attitude paying them the deference which would win their good feeling
2007-149877-0022.flac, without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions there were in the last place a few good followers neither rich nor poor famous nor yet remarkably successful with whom he was friendly on the score of good fellowship
2007-149877-0023.flac, these were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously
2007-149877-0024.flac, to go to the races the theatres the sporting entertainments at some of the clubs he kept a horse and neat trap had his wife and two children who were well established in a neat house on the north side near lincoln park
2007-149877-0025.flac, and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great american upper class the first grade below the luxuriously rich
2007-149877-0026.flac,the latter's genial nature and dressy appearance pleased him he knew that drouet was only a travelling salesman and not one of many years at that but the firm of bartlett caryoe and company
2007-149877-0027.flac, hurstwood knew caryoe quite well having drunk a glass now and then with him in company with several others when the conversation was general
2007-149877-0028.flac, a moderate sense of humour and could tell a good story when the occasion required he could talk races with hurstwood
2007-149877-0029.flac,and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited and so managed to make himself almost invariably agreeable to night he was particularly so since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon
2007-149877-0030.flac, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected and his trip marked out for the next six weeks why hello charley old man
2007-149877-0031.flac,how goes it the room was crowded drouet shook hands beaming good nature and they strolled towards the bar all right i haven't seen you in six weeks when did you get in
2007-149877-0032.flac, Friday said drouet had a fine trip glad of it said hurstwood his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make believe that usually dwelt in them what are you going to take he added as the barkeeper in snowy jacket and tie
2007-149877-0033.flac, leaned toward them from behind the bar old pepper said drouet a little of the same for me put in hurstwood how long are you in town this time inquired hurstwood only until wednesday i'm going up to saint paul
2007-149877-0034.flac, george evans was in here saturday and said he saw you in milwaukee last week yes i saw george returned drouet great old boy isn't he we had quite a time there together
2007-149877-0035.flac, as was considered proper and hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer what's become of caryoe remarked hurstwood i haven't seen him around here in two weeks
2007-149877-0036.flac, barely comes down to the office now just one boy hasn't he asked hurstwood yes and a swift bacer laughed ruey
2007-149877-0037.flac,no he can't injure that any i guess hurstwood was standing his coat open his thumbs in his pocket the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness he was the picture of fastidious comfort
2007-149877-0038.flac, to one not inclined to drink and gifted with a more serious turn of mind such a bubbling chattering glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly a strange commentary on nature and life
2007-149877-0039.flac,here come the moths in endless procession to bask in the light of the flame such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds
2007-149877-0040.flac,it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save formalities where the sharp eared may hear and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst
2007-149877-0041.flac, nevertheless the fact that here men gather here chatter here love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires
2007-149877-0042.flac,the many friends he met here dropped in because they craved
2007-149877-0043.flac,the company the glow the atmosphere which they found one might take it after all as an augur of the better social order for the things which they satisfied here though sensory were not evil
2007-149877-0044.flac,no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber the worst effect of such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the material minded and ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis
2007-149877-0045.flac, in the last analysis that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations but rather of the innate trend of the mind that such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed
2007-149877-0046.flac, could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of liquor
2007-149877-0047.flac,and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber
2007-149877-0048.flac,the dressy greedy company the small self interested palaver the disorganized aimless wandering mental action which it represents the love of light and show and finery which to one outside
2007-149877-0049.flac, under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing under the stars and sweeping night winds what a lamp flower it must bloom a
2007-149877-0050.flac, insect infested rose of pleasure see that fellow coming in there said hurstwood glancing at a gentleman just entering arrayed in a high hat and prince albert coat his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating
2007-149877-0051.flac,no where said drouet
2007-149877-0052.flac, said hurstwood indicating the direction by a cast of his eye the man with the silk hat oh yes said drouet now affecting not to see who is he that's jules wallace the spiritualist
2007-149877-0053.flac,drouet followed him with his eyes much interested doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits does he said drouet i
2007-149877-0054.flac, returned hurstwood he's got the money all right and a little twinkle passed over his eyes i don't go much on those things do you
2007-149877-0055.flac, well you never can tell said hurstwood there may be something to it i wouldn't bother about it myself though by the way he added are you going anywhere to night the hole in the ground
2007-149877-0056.flac, said drouet mentioning the popular farce at the time well you'd better be going it's half draught already any drew out as watch the crowd was already thinning out considerably
2007-149877-0057.flac, some bound for the theatres some to their clubs and some to that most fascinating of all the pleasures for the type of man there represented at least the ladies yes i will said drouet
2007-149877-0058.flac,come around after the show i have something i want to show you said hurstwood sure said drouet elated you haven't anything on hand for the night have you added hurstwood not a thing well come round then
2007-149877-0059.flac, i struck a little peach coming in on the train friday remarked drouet by way of parting by george that's so i must go and call on her before i go away oh never mind her hurstwood remarked
2007-149877-0060.flac, say she was a little dandy i tell you
2007-149877-0061.flac, twelve o'clock said hurstwood that's right
2289-152253-0000.flac,the huns had a famous king named atilla he was only twenty one years old when he became their king but although he was young he was very brave and ambitious and he wanted to be a great and powerful king not far from attila's palace
2289-152253-0001.flac,there was a great rocky cave in the mountains in this cave lived a strange man called the hermit of the rocks
2289-152253-0002.flac,he was very old with wrinkled face and long gray hair and beard many persons believed that he was a fortune teller so people often went to him to inquire what was to happen to them
2289-152253-0003.flac,one day shortly after he became king attila went to the cave to get his fortune told wise man said he look into the future and tell me what is before me in the path of life the hermit thought for a few moments and then said
2289-152253-0004.flac,o king i see you a famous conqueror the master of many nations i see you going from country to country defeating armies and destroying cities until men call you the fear of the world you heap up vast riches
2289-152253-0005.flac,but he was young and full of spirit and very soon he remembered only what had been said to him about his becoming a great and famous conqueror and began to prepare for war he gathered together the best men
2289-152253-0006.flac,from the various tribes of his people and trained them into a great army of good soldiers two about this time one of the king's shepherds while taking care of cattle in the fields
2289-152253-0007.flac, noticed blood dripping from the foot of one of the oxen the shepherd followed the streak of blood through the grass and at last found the sharp point of a sword sticking out of the earth he dug out the weapon carried it to the palace
2289-152253-0008.flac,as long as i fight with the sword of tiew as soon as his army was ready he marched with it into countries which belonged to rome he defeated the romans in several great battles and captured many of their cities
2289-152253-0009.flac,the roman emperor theodosis had to ask for terms of peace until it agreed that there should be peace but soon afterwards he found out that theodosis had formed a plot to murder him
2289-152253-0010.flac,he was so enraged at this that he again began war
2289-152253-0011.flac,and at last the emperor had to give him a large sum of money
2289-152253-0012.flac,this made peace but the peace did not last long in a few years attila appeared at the head of an army of seven hundred thousand men with this great force he marched across germany and into gaul
2289-152253-0013.flac,he attacked and destroyed towns and killed the inhabitants without mercy the people had such dread of him that he was called the scourge of god and the fear of the world three
2289-152253-0014.flac,attila and his terrible huns marched through gaul until they came to the city of orleans here the people bravely resisted the invaders they shut their gates and defended themselves in every way they could
2289-152253-0015.flac,in those times all towns of any great size were surrounded by strong walls there was war constantly going on
2289-152253-0016.flac,who lived by robbing their neighbors so the towns and castles in which there was
2289-152253-0017.flac, were not safe without high in strong walls until it tried to take orleans but soon after he began to attack the walls he saw a great army at a distance coming towards the city
2289-152253-0018.flac,the army which attilled a saw was an army of three hundred thousand romans and visigoths it was led by a roman general
2289-152253-0019.flac,the visigoths after the death of
2289-152253-0020.flac,had settled in parts of gaul and their king had now agreed to join the romans against the common enemy the terrible huns so the great army of the romans and visigoths
2289-152253-0021.flac, Thorismond the son of theodoric
2289-152253-0022.flac,when his father was killed and now he led them on to fight they were all eager to have revenge for the death of their king so they fought like lions and swept across the plain with great fury the huns were soon beaten on every side
2289-152253-0023.flac,and attila himself fled to his camp it was the first time he had ever been defeated thorismond the conqueror was lifted upon his shield on the battle field and hailed as king of the visigoths
2289-152253-0024.flac,when attila reached his camp he had all his baggage and wagons gathered in a great heap he intended to set fire to it and jump into the flames if the romans should come there to attack him
2289-152253-0025.flac,here i will perish in the flames he cried rather than surrender to my enemies
2289-152253-0026.flac, very soon however he was again on the war path this time he invaded italy
2289-152253-0027.flac,and they had no army strong enough to send against him rome would have been again destroyed if it had not been for pope leo
2289-152253-0028.flac,and persuaded him not to attack the city it is said that the barbarian king
2289-152253-0029.flac,they enclosed his body in three coffins one of gold one of silver and one of iron
2289-152253-0030.flac,when the funeral was over they killed the slaves who had dug the grave
2289-152254-0000.flac,when he was but twenty one years of age he was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very ordinary person like most of the vandals he was a cruel and cunning man but he had a great ability in many ways
2289-152254-0001.flac,but a plot was formed against him
2289-152254-0002.flac, and that he was going to make war against rome at the same time he wrote secretly to count boniface and told him that if he came to rome the empress would put him to death boniface believed this story
2289-152254-0003.flac,he also sent a letter to genseric inviting him to come to africa with an army genseric was greatly delighted to receive the invitation from boniface he had long wanted to attack rome and take from her some of the rich countries she had conquered
2289-152254-0004.flac,and marched into other parts of the coast and captured towns and cities by this time boniface had learned all about the wicked plot of aetius he now regretted having invited the vandals to africa and tried to induce them to return to spain
2289-152254-0005.flac,but genseric sternly refused never he said shall i go back to spain until i am master of africa then cried boniface i will drive you back soon after there was a battle between the romans and vandals and the romans were defeated
2289-152254-0006.flac,they were also defeated in several other battles at last they had to flee for safety to two or three towns which the vandals had not yet taken one of these towns was hippo genseric captured this town
2289-152254-0007.flac, destroyed valuable property a great many of the natives of africa joined the army of genseric they had for a long time been ill treated by the romans and were glad to see them defeated
2289-152254-0008.flac,he built great fleets and sailed over the mediterranean capturing trading vessels for many years he plundered towns along the coasts
2289-152254-0009.flac,after ruling several years found an attinion had just been murdered by roman noble named maximus who had at once made himself emperor when the messenger entered the room where jen seric was he said great king
2289-152254-0010.flac,i bring you a message from the empress eudoxia she begs your help she and her two beautiful daughters are in danger in rome she wishes you to protect them against maximus she invites you to come with an army to rome and take the city
2289-152254-0011.flac,she and her friends will help you as much as they can with a cry of joy genseric sprang to his feet and exclaimed tell the empress that i accept her invitation i shall set out for rome immediately
2289-152254-0012.flac,i shall set out for rome immediately i shall protect eudoxia and her friends genseric then got ready a fleet and a great army and sailed across the mediterranean
2289-152254-0013.flac, to the mouth of the tiber when the emperor maximus heard that the vandals were coming he prepared to flee from the city and he advised the senate to do the same the people were so angry at this
2289-152254-0014.flac,it was only forty five years since alaric had been there
2289-152254-0015.flac,but since then rome had become again grand and wealthy so there was plenty for genseric and his vandals to carry away they spent fourteen days in the work of plunder they sacked the temples
2289-152254-0016.flac, and public buildings and private houses
2289-152254-0017.flac, some years after the capture of rome by genseric there was a roman emperor named ma jo'ri an he was a good ruler and a brave man the vandals still continued to attack and plunder cities in italy
2289-152254-0018.flac, and other countries belonging to rome and majorian resolved to punish them so he got together a great army and built a fleet of three hundred ships to carry his troops to carthage
2289-152254-0019.flac,but he first marched his men across the alps through gaul and down to the seaport of carthagena in spain where his fleet was stationed he took this route because he expected to add to his forces
2289-152254-0020.flac,as he went along before sailing with his army for carthage he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people the vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was generally believed
2289-152254-0021.flac, and entertained him hospitably not knowing that he was the emperor majorian of course peace was not made the emperor left carthage after having got as much information as he could
2289-152254-0022.flac, bunch and serek did not wait for the roman fleet to come to attack him in his capital when he got word that it was in the bay of carthagena he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single bay burned or sank nearly all the roman ships
2289-152254-0023.flac,after this the vandals became more than ever the terror of the mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it every year their ships went round the coasts from asia minor to spain attacking and plundering cities on their way
2289-152254-0024.flac, and carrying off prisoners all the efforts of the romans failed to put stop to these ravages the emperor leo who ruled over the eastern division of the empire fitted out a great fleet at constantinople
2289-152254-0025.flac, to make another attempt to suppress the pirates there were more than a thousand ships in this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men
2289-152254-0026.flac,the brother of emperor leo's wife basilicus sailed with his ships to africa and landed the army not far from carthage genseric asked for a truce for five days to consider terms of peace and the truce was granted
2289-152254-0027.flac,but the cunning vandal was not thinking of peace he only wanted time to carry out a plan he had made to destroy the roman fleet one dark night during the truce he filled the largest of his ships
2289-152254-0028.flac,in among the roman ships towing behind them large boats filled with material that would easily burn these boats were set on fire and floated against the roman vessels which also were soon on fire the flames quickly spread
2289-152254-0029.flac, and in a very short time a great part of the roman fleet was destroyed basilicus fled with as many ships as he could save and returned to constantinople this was the last attempt of the romans to conquer the vandals
2289-152257-0000.flac, in the time of clovus the country now called bulgeria wasn't habited by goths one day a poor shepherd boy about sixteen years of age left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of constantinople which was many miles away
2289-152257-0001.flac,but he was determined to go even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live on fruits that he could gather by the way he was a bright clever boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village but was now eager to go out into the world
2289-152257-0002.flac, to seek his fortune some years before this boy's uncle who was named justin had gone to constantinople and joined the roman army he was so brave and so good a soldier that he soon came to be
2289-152257-0003.flac, commander of the imperial guard which attended the emperor the poor shepherd boy had heard of the success of his uncle and this was the reason why he resolved to set out for the big city so he started down the mountain
2289-152257-0004.flac, and trudged along the valley in high hope feeling certain that he would reach the end of his journey in safety
2289-152257-0005.flac,and to cross rivers and high hills but at last one afternoon and midsummer he walked through the main gate of constant nubble proud and happy that he had accomplished his purpose he had no trouble in finding his uncle justin
2289-152257-0006.flac, and gave him the best education that could be had in the city
2289-152257-0007.flac, richly dressed he was well liked at the emperor's court and was respected by everybody on account of his learning two one day a great change came for both uncle and nephew the emperor died
2289-152257-0008.flac, in ruling the empire justinus agreed to this proposal for he was now old and in feeble health and not able himself to attend to the important affairs of government
2289-152257-0009.flac,justinian reigned for nearly forty years and did so many important things that he was afterwards called justinian the great he had many wars during his reign but he himself did not take part in them
2289-152257-0010.flac,he was fortunate enough however to have two great generals to lead his armies one of them was named belisarius and the other narses belisarius was one of the greatest soldiers that ever lived
2289-152257-0011.flac, he gained wonderful victories for justinian and conquered some of the old roman provinces that had been lost for many years the victories of these two generals largely helped to make the reign of justinian remarkable in history
2289-152257-0012.flac, that were carried on a fleet of six hundred ships it took this fleet three months to make the voyage from constantinople to africa the same voyage may now be made in a very few days but in the time of belisarius there were no steamships
2289-152257-0013.flac,and nothing was known of the power of steam of foremoting machinery the ships or galleys were sailing vessels and when there was no wind they could make no progress except by rowing when belisarius reached africa
2289-152257-0014.flac,he left five men as a guard in each vessel and with the body of his army he marched for some days along the coast the people received him in a friendly way for they had grown tired of the rule of the vandals
2289-152257-0015.flac, and preferred to be under the government of the romans about ten miles from carthage he met a large army led by the brother of gelimer a battle immediately took place and the vandals were utterly defeated
2289-152257-0016.flac,gelimer gave himself up to belisarius who took him to constantinople justinian set apart an estate for him to live upon and the conquered king passed the rest of his life in peaceful retirement
2289-152257-0017.flac,after conquering the vandals justinian resolved to conquer italy which was then held by the ostrogoths a large army was got together and put under the command of belisarius and narses who immediately set out for italy

2289-152257-0024.flac,for a long time the roman laws had been difficult to understand there was a vast number of them and different writers differed widely as to what the laws really were and what they meant justinian employed a great lawyer named
2289-152257-0025.flac,terbonian to collect and simplify the principal laws the collection which he made was called the code of justinian it still exists and is the model according to which most of the countries of the europe have made their laws

2289-152257-0027.flac, and a hard worker he often worked or studied all day and all night without eating or sleeping
2289-152258-0000.flac,a great number of people in asia and africa and much of those in turkey in europe professed the mohammedan religion they are called mohammedans muslims or muslims
2289-152258-0001.flac,and the proper name for their religion is islam which means obedience or submission

2289-152258-0004.flac,and he soon became a skillful camel driver mohammed was very faithful and honest in all his work he always spoke the truth and never broke a promise i have given my promise he would say and i must keep it
2289-152258-0005.flac,that people gave him the name of el amin which means the truthful at this time he was only sixteen years of age but the rich traders had so much confidence in him that they gave him important business to attend to and trusted him with large sums of money
2289-152258-0006.flac,and sold there the goods carried by the camels
2289-152258-0007.flac, and faithfully paid over to the owners of the goods the money he had received mohammed had no school education he could neither read nor write but he was not ignorant he knew well how to do the work intrusted to him and
2289-152258-0008.flac,this woman was a widow who was carrying on the business left her by her husband as soon as the camel driver saw mohammed he stopped him and said my mistress wishes to see you before noon i think she intends to engage you to take charge of her caravans
2289-152258-0009.flac,as quickly as possible he went to the house of khadijah for he was well pleased at the thought of being employed in so important a service
2289-152258-0010.flac,she said i have heard much of you among the traders
2289-152258-0011.flac,are you willing to take charge of my caravans and give your whole time and service to me mohammed was delighted
2289-152258-0012.flac,khadijah then engaged him as the manager of her business and he served her well and faithfully she thought a great deal of him
2289-152258-0013.flac,and soon they came to love one another and were married as he was now the husband of a rich woman he did not need to work very hard he still continued to attend to his wife's business but he did not make so many journeys as before
2289-152258-0014.flac,and christianity but he was not satisfied with either of them
2289-152258-0015.flac, worshiped idols very few of them were christians
2289-152258-0016.flac,in a cave on mount hurrah near mecca he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious meditation he declared that while praying in his cave he often had visions of god and heaven
2289-152258-0017.flac,he said that many times the angel gabriel appeared to him and revealed to him the religion which he afterward taught his followers as he himself could not write he committed to memory all that the angel told him and had it written in a book
2289-152258-0018.flac,this book is called the koran which means like our own word bible the book
2289-152258-0019.flac,three when mohammed returned home after the angel had first spoken to him he told his wife of what he had seen and heard she at once believed and so became a convert to the new religion
2289-152258-0020.flac,she fell upon her knees at the feet of her husband and cried out there is but one god mohammed is god's prophet mohammed then told the story to other members of his family some of them believed and became his first followers
2289-152258-0021.flac, soon afterwards he began to preach to the people he spoke in the market and other public places
2289-152258-0022.flac, laughed at what he told them but some poor people and a few slaves believed him and adopted the new religion others said he was a dreamer and a fool mohammed however paid no heed to the insults he received
2289-152258-0023.flac,he went on telling about the appearance of gaybrill and preaching the doctrines which he said the angel had ordered him to teach the people
2289-152258-0024.flac,at such times his face grew pale as death his eyes became red and staring he spoke and allowed voice and his body trembled violently then he would tell what he had seen in his vision
2289-152258-0025.flac, people came from distant parts of arabia and from neighboring countries to hear him one day six of the chief men of medina
2289-152258-0026.flac,about this time mohammed's uncle and wife died and he had then hardly any friends in mecca he therefore resolved to leave that city and go to medina numbers of the people there believed his doctrines
2289-152258-0027.flac,and wished him to come and live among them so he secretly left his native town and fled from his enemies with a few faithful companions he made his escape to medina
2289-152258-0028.flac, that mohammed fled from mecca this event is very important in the mohammedan history it is called the flight of the prophet or the hejira
2289-152258-0029.flac,the remainder of his life a splendid church was built for him in medina it was called a mosque and all mohammedan churches or places of worship
2289-152258-0030.flac,he gained many victories he marched against mecca with an army of ten thousand men and the city surrendered with little resistance the people then joined his religion and destroyed their idols
2289-152258-0031.flac,he was buried in the mosque in which he had held religious services for so many years
2289-152258-0032.flac, that the body still lies in the coffin in the same state as when it was first buried
2289-152258-0033.flac, that the coffin of mohammed rests somewhere between heaven and earth suspended in the air but this fable was invented by enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion
2289-152258-0034.flac,every mussulman is bound by his religion to make a visit or pilgrimage to mecca at least once in his life
2289-152258-0035.flac,of the mosque and chanting in a loud voice such words as these come to prayer come to prayer there is no god but god he giveth life and he dieth not i praise his perfection god is great in mecca
2289-152258-0036.flac, there is a mosque called the great mosque it is a large enclosure in the form of a quadrangle or square
2289-152258-0037.flac, and its wall at one corner is the celebrated black stone moslems regard this stone with the greatest reverence they say that it came down from heaven it is said to have been once white
2289-152258-0038.flac,but has become dark from being wept upon and touched by so many millions of pilgrims it really is reddish brown in color before the time of mohammed the ka'a ba was a pagan temple
2289-152258-0039.flac,but when he took possession of mecca he made the old temple the center of worship for his own religion after mohammed died a person was appointed to be his successor as head of the muslim church
2289-152258-0040.flac,and this title has been born ever since by the religious chief of the mohammedans in modern times the sultans or rulers of turkey
2836-5354-0000.flac, nearly a year went by lady isabel carlyle had spent it on the continent that refuge for such fugitives now moving about from place to place with her companion now stationary and alone quite half the time
2836-5354-0001.flac,taking one absence with the other he had been away from her chiefly in paris pursuing his own course and his own pleasure how fared it with lady isabel just as it must be expected to fare and does fare
2836-5354-0002.flac,when a high principled gentlewoman falls from her pedestal never had she experienced a moment's calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion
2836-5354-0003.flac,when instead of the garden of roses it had been her persuader's pleasure to promise her she would fall into but which in truth she had barely glanced at for that had not been her moving motive
2836-5354-0004.flac,she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror from which there was never more any escape never more never more the very instant the very night of her departure she awoke to what she had done the guilt
2836-5354-0005.flac, whose aspect had been shunned in the prospective assumed at once its true frightful color the blackness of darkness and a lively remorse a never dying anguish took possession of her soul forever oh reader believe me
2836-5354-0006.flac, lady wife mother should you ever be tempted to abandon your home so will you awake whatever trials may be the lot of your married life though they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature
2836-5354-0007.flac,the endurance of woman to bear resolve to bear them fall down upon your knees and pray to be enabled to bear them pray for patience pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape bear unto death
2836-5354-0008.flac,rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience for be assured that the alternative if you do rush on to it will be found worse than death poor thing poor lady isabel she had sacrificed husband children
2836-5354-0009.flac, reputation home all that makes life of value to woman she had forfeited her duty to god had deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison
2836-5354-0010.flac,but the instant the step was irrevocable the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance set in even in the first days of her departure in the fleeting moments of abandonment when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience
2836-5354-0011.flac,it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings and she knew that her whole future existence whether spent with that man or without him would be a dark course of gnawing retribution nearly a year went by save some six or eight weeks
2836-5354-0012.flac, furnished in the vicinity of the place grenette a windy old house it was full of doors and windows chimneys and cupboards and he said he should remain there lady isabel remonstrated
2836-5354-0013.flac,she wished to go farther on where they might get quicker news from england but her will now was as nothing she was looking like the ghost of her former self talk of her having looked ill when she took that voyage over the water with mister carlyle you should have seen her now
2836-5354-0014.flac, misery marks the countenance worse than sickness her face was white and worn her hands were thin her eyes were sunken and surrounded by a black circle care was digging caves for them
2836-5354-0015.flac, a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health she knew better knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart it was very late for breakfast but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day
2836-5354-0016.flac, languidly she took her seat at the table just as captain levison's servant a frenchman whom he had engaged in paris entered the room with two letters point de gazette pierre
2836-5354-0017.flac, and all the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket but he was only obeying the orders of his master it had been captain levison's recent pleasure that the newspapers should not be seen by lady isabel until he had over looked them
2836-5354-0018.flac,you will speedily gather his motive pierre departed toward captain levison's room and lady isabel took up the letters and examined their superscription with interest it was known to her that mister carlyle had not lost a moment
2836-5354-0019.flac, in seeking a divorce and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected she was anxious for it anxious that captain levison should render her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child
2836-5354-0020.flac, little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation any more than he had made it to others who had gone before her she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself
2836-5354-0021.flac,the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest slovens in domestic privacy he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy and she as apathetically answered to it pierre says there are some letters he began
2836-5354-0022.flac,last out a whole ten months you are in a greigious error complements the very opposite to honey and sweetness have generally supervamed long before try it if you don't believe me two letters she continued
2836-5354-0023.flac,and they are both in the same handwriting your solicitors i believe up went his hand at the last word and he made a sort of grab at the letters stalked to the farthest window opened it and glanced over its contents sir
2836-5354-0024.flac, we beg to inform you that the suit carlyle vs carlyle is at an end the divorce was pronounced without opposition according to your request we hasten to forward you the earliest intimation of the fact we are sir faithfully yours moss and grab
2836-5354-0025.flac,it was over then and all claim to the name of carlyle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabel forever captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket is there any news she asked
2836-5354-0026.flac,news of the divorce i mean tush was the response of captain levison as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a far off affair
2836-5354-0027.flac, sir after sending off our last dated to day we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison your grand uncle he expired this afternoon in town where he had come for the benefit of medical advice
2836-5354-0028.flac,we have much pleasure in congratulating you upon your accession to the title and estates and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you
2836-5354-0029.flac, on your favoring us with instructions and we remain sir most faithfully yours moss and grab sir francis levison bart the outside of the letter was superscribed as the other f levison esquire
2836-5354-0030.flac,at last thank the pigs was the gentleman's euphonious expression as he tossed the letter open on the breakfast table the divorce is granted feverishly uttered lady isabel he made no reply but seated himself to breakfast
2836-5354-0031.flac, you may drop that odious title isabel which has stuck to me too long i own a better now what one pray you can look and see lady isabel took up the letter and read it sir francis swallowed down his coffee and rang the
2836-5354-0032.flac, table hand bell the only bell you generally meet with in france pierre answered it put me up a change of things said he in french i start for england in an hour it is very well pierre responded and departed to do it
2836-5354-0033.flac,lady isabel waited till the man was gone and then spoke a faint flush of emotion in her cheeks you do not mean what you say you will not leave me yet i cannot do otherwise he answered there's a mountain of business to be attended to
2836-5354-0034.flac, besides i should not choose for the old man's funeral to take place without me
2836-5354-0035.flac,you might not be back in time in time for what oh how can you ask she rejoined in a sharp tone of reproach you know too well in time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear i shall chance it
2836-5354-0036.flac,couilly observed sir francis chance it chance the legitimacy of the child you must assure that before all things
2836-5354-0037.flac,now don't put yourself in a fever isabel how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you it does no good is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england have you no pity for your child she urged in agitation
2836-5354-0038.flac,nothing can repair the injury if you once suffer it to come upon him he will be a by word amidst men throughout his life you had better have written to the law lords to urge on the divorce he returned i cannot help the delay
2836-5354-0039.flac,there has been no delay quite the contrary but it may be expected hourly now you are worrying yourself for nothing isabel i shall be back in time he quitted the room as he spoke and lady isabel remained in it the image of despair
2836-5354-0040.flac,nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed
2836-5354-0041.flac, where is pierre miladi asked
2836-5354-0042.flac, scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and the tray when sir francis levison appeared equipped for traveling good bye isabel said he without further circumlocution or ceremony
2836-5354-0043.flac, lady isabel excited beyond all self control slipped the bolt to the door and half leaning against it half leaning at his feet held up her hand in supplication francis have you any consideration left for me any in the world
2836-5354-0044.flac,how can he be so alarmed isabel of course i have he continued in a peevish though kind tone as he took hold of her hands to raise her no not yet i will remain here until you say you will wait another day or two
2836-5354-0045.flac,you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us the instant news of the divorce shall arrive
2836-5354-0046.flac,you will wait i cannot wait he replied his tone changing to one of determination it is useless to urge it he broke from her and left the room and in another minute had left the house pierre attending him a feeling amounting to a conviction
2836-5354-0047.flac, and white and sleety and sloppy the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets were unusually black and the people crept along especially dismal close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom
2836-5354-0048.flac, full of windows and doors and draughts with its wide hearth and its wide chimney into which we could put four or five of our english ones shivered lady isabel vane she had an invalid cap on and a thick woolen invalid shawl
2836-5354-0049.flac, and she shook and shivered perpetually though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and the crackling logs
2836-5354-0050.flac,she had had a long illness terminating in a low fever
2836-5354-0051.flac, that miladi would soon get about if she would only rouse herself she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it
2836-5354-0052.flac,had he come who is it she asked of the nurse miladi it is monsieur and pierre is with him i have begged miladi often and often not to fret for monsieur would surely come miladi see i am right
2836-5354-0053.flac,the girl departed closing the door and lady isabel sat looking at it schooling her patience another moment and it was flung open sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in she waved him off begging him
2836-5354-0054.flac, in a subdued quiet tone not to draw too near as any little excitement made her faint now he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot as he explained that he really could not get away from town before
2836-5355-0000.flac, settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction to speak and act let there be plain truth between us at this center view if there never has been before i don't understand you make it truth unglossed over
2836-5355-0001.flac, she pursued bending her eyes determinately upon him it must be with all my heart returned sir francis it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind
2836-5355-0002.flac,when you left in july you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage you know what i mean when i say in time but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise he interrupted but no sooner had i set my foot in london
2836-5355-0003.flac, than i found myself overwhelmed with business and away from it i could not get even now i can only remain with you a couple of days for i must hasten back to town you are breaking faith already she said after hearing him calmly to the end
2836-5355-0004.flac,your words are not words of truth but of deceit you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage
2836-5355-0005.flac, what fancies you do take up uttered francis levison some time subsequent to your departure she quietly went on one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets
2836-5355-0006.flac, i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning of your departure it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced she spoke so quietly so apparently without feeling or passion that sir francis was agreeably astonished
2836-5355-0007.flac,he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask but he was an ill tempered man and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now lady isabel continued
2836-5355-0008.flac,it would have been better to have undeceived me then to have told me that the hopes i was cherishing for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain i did not judge so he replied the excited state you then appeared to be in
2836-5355-0009.flac, would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it you deem that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time
2836-5355-0010.flac,well isabel you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks but her voice sounded calm as before
2836-5355-0011.flac,when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed
2836-5355-0012.flac, and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed he did not take the trouble to look at it i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy he resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words
2836-5355-0013.flac,and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay interrupted lady isabel you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife were you to propose to do so this day
2836-5355-0014.flac,and bring a clergyman into the room to perform the ceremony it would be futile the injury to the child can never be repaired and for myself i cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you
2836-5355-0015.flac,if you have taken this aversion to me it cannot be helped he coldly said inwardly congratulating himself let us not doubt at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation
2836-5355-0016.flac,she shook her head all the reparation in your power to make all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin it and the effects must lie upon me forever oh sin was the derisive exclamation
2836-5355-0017.flac, you ladies should think of that beforehand yes she sadly answered may heaven help all to do so who may be tempted as i was if you mean that as a reproach to me it's rather out of place chafed sir francis
2836-5355-0018.flac, whose fits of ill temper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger toward your husband
2836-5355-0019.flac, quite true was her reply and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabel if it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse it is of no consequence to smooth over facts
2836-5355-0020.flac,i do not understand what you would imply she said drawing her shawl round her with a fresh shiver how on the wrong scent with regard to your husband and that hare girl you were blindly outrageously jealous of him go on
2836-5355-0021.flac,and i say i think you are on the wrong scent i do not believe mister carlyle ever thought of the girl in that way what do you mean she gasped they had a secret between them not of love a secret of business and those interviews they had together
2836-5355-0022.flac,her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and not alone her face was more flush than it had been throughout the interview he spoke quietly now quite in an equal tone of reasoning it was his way when the ill temper was upon him
2836-5355-0023.flac,and the calmer he spoke the more cutting were his words he need not have told her this what was the secret she inquired in a low tone nay i can't explain all they did not take me into their confidence they did not even take you
2836-5355-0024.flac, and carlyle was acting in it under the rose for missus hare she could not seek out carlyle herself so she sent the young lady that's all i know how did you know it i had reason to think so
2836-5355-0025.flac, what reason i must request you to tell me i overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings and so gathered my information you told a different tale to me sir francis was her remark
2836-5355-0026.flac,as she turned her indignant eyes toward him sir francis laughed all stratagems are fair in love and war she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb
2836-5355-0027.flac,over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle what have you named that young article there the name which ought to have been his by inheritance
2836-5355-0028.flac,was her icy answer let's see how old is he now he was born on the last day of august sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes
2836-5355-0029.flac,who is he like isabel my handsome self were he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided
2836-5355-0030.flac, outwardly into calmness again what else reported sir francis you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me
2836-5355-0031.flac,she made no reply sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child returned to the fire and stood a few moments with his back to it is my room prepared for me do you know he presently asked no it is not she quietly rejoined
2836-5355-0032.flac,these apartments are mine now they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation will you be so obliging i am not strong as to hand me that writing case sir francis walked to the table she indicated
2836-5355-0033.flac, which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writing case from it gave it to her she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow unlocked the case and took from it some bank notes
2836-5355-0034.flac, i received these from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so
2836-5355-0035.flac,allow me to return them to you count them return them to me for what inquired sir francis in amazement i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long take them
2836-5355-0036.flac,if it be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so he said i must confess i think it may be the wisest course as things have come to this pass for a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable
2836-5355-0037.flac, remember though that it is your doing not mine but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel a sum we will fix upon the amount amicably
2836-5355-0038.flac, i beg of you to cease she passionately interrupted what do you take me for take you for why how can you live you have no fortune you must receive assistance from some one i will not receive it from you if the whole world denied me
2836-5355-0039.flac, sarcastically rejoined sir francis generous man a flush deep and painful died her cheeks i should have said my late husband you need not have reminded me of the mistake
2836-5355-0040.flac,if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child he at any rate falls to my share i shall give you a few hundred a year with him she beat her hands before her as if beating off the man and his words
2836-5355-0041.flac, whom do you take me for what do you take me for she repeated rising in her bitter mortification if you have put me beyond the pale of the world i am still lord mount severn's daughter you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as
2836-5355-0042.flac,don't i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it
2836-5355-0043.flac,resumed sir francis in a little time you may probably wish to recall it in which case a line addressed to me at my banker's will lady isabel drew herself up put away those notes if you please she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence
2836-5355-0044.flac, he took out his pocket book and placed the bank notes within it your clothes
2836-5355-0045.flac,you will have the goodness to order pierre to take away this afternoon and now sir francis i believe that is all we will part to remain mortal enemies from hen's forth is that to be it to be strangers she replied correcting him
2836-5355-0046.flac, i wish you a good day so you will not even shake hands with me isabel i would prefer not and thus they parted sir francis left the room but not immediately the house he went into a distant apartment
2836-5355-0047.flac, and calling the servants before him there were but two gave them each a year's wages in advance
2836-5355-0048.flac,then he paid a visit to the landlord and handed him likewise a year's rent in advance making the same remark after that he ordered dinner at a hotel and the same night he and pierre departed on their journey home again
2836-5355-0049.flac, sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks
2836-5355-0050.flac,into an adjoining room when lady isabel lay down to rest she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep than she had known of late also into a dream she thought she was back at east lynne not back in one sense
2836-5355-0051.flac, but that she seemed never to have gone away from it walking in the flower garden with mister carlyle while the three children played on the lawn her arm was within her husband's and he was relating something to her what the news was she could not remember afterward
2836-5355-0052.flac, excepting that it was connected with the office and old mister dill and that mister carlyle laughed when he told it they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter she awoke
2836-5355-0053.flac, alas it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her this last child the ill fated little being in the cradle beside her
289-121652-0000.flac, none of us whether children or adults needs an introduction to mother goose those things which are earliest impressed upon our minds cling to them most tenaciously the snatches sung in the nursery are never forgotten
289-121652-0001.flac,nor are they ever recalled without bringing back with them myriads of slumbering feelings and half forgotten images we hear the sweet low voice of the mother singing soft lullabies to her darling
289-121652-0002.flac,and see the kindly wrinkled face of the grandmother as she croons the old ditties to quiet our restless spirits one generation is linked to another by the everlasting spirit of song
289-121652-0003.flac,the ballads of the nursery follow us from childhood to old age and they are readily brought from memories recesses at any time to amuse our children or our grandchildren the collection of jingles we know and love as the melodies of mother goose
289-121652-0004.flac, are evidently drawn from a variety of sources while they are taken altogether a happy union of rhyme wit
289-121652-0005.flac,the research after the author of each individual verse would indeed be hopeless it would be folly to suppose them all the composition of uneducated old nurses for many of them contain much reflection wit and melody
289-121652-0006.flac,it is said that shelley wrote pussy cat mew and dean swift little bo peep and these assertions are as difficult to disprove as to prove some of the older verses however
289-121652-0007.flac, are doubtless offshoots from ancient folk lore songs and have descended to us through many centuries the connection of mother goose with the rhymes which bear her name is difficult to determine and in fact three countries claim her for their own
289-121652-0008.flac,france england and america about the year sixteen fifty there appeared in circulation in london a small book named rhymes of the nursery or lulla byes for children
289-121652-0009.flac,which contained many of the identical pieces that have been handed down to us but the name of mother goose was evidently not then known in this edition were the rhymes of little jack homer old king cole mistress mary sing a song o sixpence
289-121652-0010.flac,and little boy blue in sixteen ninety seven charles perrault published in france
289-121652-0011.flac,although parot's tails differ materially from those we now know under this title they comprised the sleeping beauty the fairy little red riding hood blue beard pussing boots
289-121652-0012.flac, rakeh with the tuft senderrella and little thumb eight stories and all on the cover of the book was depicted an old lady holding in her hand a de staff
289-121652-0013.flac,america bases her claim to mother goose upon the following statement made by the late john fleet eliot a descendant of thomas fleet the printer at the beginning of the eighteenth century there lived in boston a lady named eliza goose
289-121652-0014.flac, written also vergoose and vertigoose who belonged to a wealthy family her eldest daughter elizabeth goose or vertigoose
289-121652-0015.flac,and in due time gave birth to a son like most mothers in law in our day the importance of missus goose increased with the appearance of her grandchild and poor mister fleet half distracted with her endless nursery ditties finding all other means fail
289-121652-0016.flac, tried what ridicule could effect and actually printed a book under the title songs of the nursery or mother goose's melodies for children on the title page was the picture of a goose with a very long neck and a mouth wide open and below this
289-121652-0017.flac, printed by tea fleet at his printing house in pudding lane seventeen nineteen price two coppers mister william a wheeler the editor of hurd and howton's elaborate edition of mother goose eighteen seventy reiterated this assertion
289-121652-0018.flac,and a writer in the boston transcript of june seventeenth eighteen sixty four says fleet's book was partly a reprint of an english collection of songs barclay's and the new title was doubtless a compliment by the printer to his mother in law goose for her contributions
289-121652-0019.flac,she was the mother of sixteen children and a typical old woman who lived in a shoe we may take it to be true that fleet's wife was of the vergoose family and that the name was often contracted to goose
289-121652-0020.flac,but the rest of the story is unsupported by any evidence whatever in fact all that mister eliot knew of it was the statement of the late edward a crowninshield of boston that he had seen fleet's edition in the library of the american antiquarian society
289-121652-0021.flac, repeated researches at worcester having failed to bring to light this supposed copy and no record of it appearing on any catalogue there we may dismiss the entire story with the supposition that mister eliot misunderstood the remarks made to him
289-121652-0022.flac,indeed as mister william h wit more points out in his clever monograph upon mother goose albany eighteen eighty nine it is very doubtful whether in seventeen nineteen
289-121652-0023.flac,boston children at that date says mister witmore or fed upon gospel food and it seems extremely improbable that an edition could have been sold
289-121652-0024.flac, is of about the same date as boston's there lived in a town in sussex about the year seventeen o four an old woman named martha gooch she was a capital nurse and in great demand to care for newly born babies therefore
289-121652-0025.flac,through long years of service as nurse she came to be called mother gooch this good woman had one peculiarity she was accustomed to croon queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges and these rhymes
289-121652-0026.flac, seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them that they began to call her mother goose in division the term being derived from queen goosefoot the mother of charlemagne the old nurse paid no attention to our critics
289-121652-0027.flac,but continued to sing her rhymes as before for however much grown people might laugh at her the children seemed to enjoy them very much and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses
289-121652-0028.flac,at one time mistress gooch was nursing a child of mister ronald barclay a physician residing in the town and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them in time he wrote them all down and made a book of them
289-121652-0029.flac,which it is said was printed by john whirlington and son in the strand london in seventeen twelve under the name of ye melodious rhymes of mother goose but even this story of martha gooch
289-121652-0030.flac, is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence the earliest english edition of mother goose's melodies that is absolutely authentic was issued by john newbury of london about the year seventeen sixty and the first authentic american edition
289-121652-0031.flac, in seventeen eighty five none of the earlier editions however contained all the rhymes so well known at the present day since every decade has added its quota to the mass of jingles attributed to mother goose
289-121652-0032.flac,some of the earlier verses have become entirely obsolete and it is well they have for many were crude and silly and others were coarse it is simply a result of the greater refinement of modern civilization
289-121652-0033.flac, that they have been relegated to oblivion while the real gems of the collection will doubtless live and grow in popular favour for many ages
289-121652-0034.flac,it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth or a living eliza goose martha gooch or the mere oye of perrault the songs that cluster around her name are what we love
289-121652-0035.flac,and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does mother goose herself many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves telling their story tersely but completely there are others which are but bare suggestions
289-121652-0036.flac, leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story perhaps therein may lie part of their charm but however that may be i have thought the children might like the stories told at greater length that they may dwell the longer upon their favorite heroes and heroines
289-121652-0037.flac, for that reason i have written this book in making the stories i have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes and my hope is that the little ones will like them and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations
289-121652-0038.flac, l frank baum chicago illinois
289-121665-0000.flac,and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills and each morning the mother took her crook
289-121665-0001.flac,and started out with her sheep that they might feed upon the tender juicy grasses with which the hills abounded the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side
289-121665-0002.flac,upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the ewes and lambs so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient shepherdess so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage little bo peep as she was called
289-121665-0003.flac,decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself she was a little mite of a child with flowing nut brown locks and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths she wore a light gray frock
289-121665-0004.flac, fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair all the shepherds and shepherdesses upon the hills both young and old soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed
289-121665-0005.flac,and there were many willing hands to aid her if which was not often she needed their assistance bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and
289-121665-0006.flac, laying aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her aged mother one day while thus occupied
289-121665-0007.flac, good morning little boat paper and looking up the girl saw women standing near her and leaning upon on a short stick she was bent nearly double by weight of many years her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as cold
289-121665-0008.flac,deep wrinkles seamed her face and hands while her nose and chin were so pointed that they nearly met she was not pleasant to look upon but bo peep had learned to be polite to the aged so she answered sweetly
289-121665-0009.flac, good morning mother can i do anything for you no dearie returned the woman in a cracked voice but i will sit by your side and rest for a time the girl made room on the mound beside her
289-121665-0010.flac,and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy fingers sew up the seams of the new frock she was making by and by the woman asked why do you come out here to sew because i am a shepherdess replied the girl
289-121665-0011.flac,but where is your crook on the grass beside me and where are your sheep bo peep looked up and could not see them they must have strayed over the top of the hill she said and i will go and seek them
289-121665-0012.flac,do not be in a hurry croaked the old woman they will return presently without your troubling to find them do you think so aspo peep of course do not the sheep know you
289-121665-0013.flac, oh yes they know me every one and do not you know the sheep i can call every one by name said bo peep confidently for though i am so young a shepherdess i am fond of my sheep and know all about them
289-121665-0014.flac,the old woman chuckled softly as if the answer amused her and replied no one knows all about anything my dear but i know all about my sheep protested little bo peep do you indeed
289-121665-0015.flac,then you are wiser than most people and if you know all about them you also know they will come home of their own accord and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual
289-121665-0016.flac, oh said little bo peep in surprise do they wag their tails i never noticed that indeed exclaimed the old woman then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep
289-121665-0017.flac,perhaps you have never noticed their tails at all no answered bo peep thoughtfully i do n't know that i ever have the woman laughed so hard at this reply
289-121665-0018.flac,that she began to cough and this made the girl remember that her flock had strayed away i really must go and find my sheep she said rising to her feet and then i shall be sure to notice their tails and see if they wag them sit still my child
289-121665-0019.flac,said the old woman i am going over the hill top myself and i will send the sheep back to you so she got upon her feet and began climbing the hill and the girl heard her saying as she walked away little bo peep has lost her sheep
289-121665-0020.flac,and does n't know where to find em but leave em alone and they ll come home all wagging their tails behind em little bo peep sat still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hill side and disappear over the top by and by she thought
289-121665-0021.flac,very soon i shall see the sheep coming back but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance soon the head of the little shepherdess began to nod
289-121665-0022.flac,little bo peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleating but when she awoke she found it a joke for still they were a fleeting the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill
289-121665-0023.flac,but as it was now time for luncheon she opened her little basket and ate of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring near by
289-121665-0024.flac,she decided she would not wait any longer so up she took her little crook determined for to find them and began climbing the hill when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about
289-121665-0025.flac,only a green valley and another hill beyond now really alarmed for the safety of her charge bo peep hurried into the valley and up the farther hill side panting and tired she reached the summit and pausing breathlessly
289-121665-0026.flac, gazed below her quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her tront flock looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle shepherdess bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them
289-121665-0027.flac,but when she came near she stopped in amazement and held up her little hands with a pretty expression of dismay she had found them indeed but it made her heart bleed
289-121665-0028.flac,nothing was left to eat sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be and little bo peep was so heartbroken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly
289-121665-0029.flac,but after awhile the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lambkins so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her
289-121665-0030.flac,so you have found your sheep dearie she said in her cracked voice yes replied little bo peep with difficulty repressing a sob but look mother they've all left their tails behind them why so they have exclaimed the old woman
289-121665-0031.flac,and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her what do you suppose has become of their tails asked the girl oh some one has probably cut them off they make nice tippets in winter time you know
289-121665-0032.flac,and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep and so driving them before her she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost tails
289-121665-0033.flac,but soon the sun began to sink over the hill tops and she knew she must take her sheep home before night overtook them she did not tell her mother of her misfortune for she feared the old shepherdess would scold her
289-121665-0034.flac,and bo peep had fully decided to seek for the tails and find them before she related the story of their loss to anyone each day for many days after that little bo peep wandered about the hills seeking the tails of her sheep
289-121665-0035.flac,and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious but there is an end to all troubles no matter how severe they may seem to be and it happened one day as bo peep did stray unto a meadow hard by
289-121665-0036.flac,the little shepherdess was overjoyed at this discovery and reaching up her crook she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock but how to fasten them onto her sheep again was the question
289-121665-0037.flac, and after pondering the matter for a time she became discouraged and thinking she was no better off than before the tails were found she began to weep and to bewail her misfortune but amidst her tears she bethought herself of her needle and thread
289-121665-0038.flac,why she exclaimed smiling again i can sew them on of course then she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran o'er hill and dale oh and tried what she could as a shepherdess should to tack to each sheep its tail oh
289-121665-0039.flac,but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail and ran away from her and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met
289-121665-0040.flac, came hobbling to her side and asked what are you doing with my cat tails your cat tails replied bo peep in surprise what do you mean why these tails are all cut from white pussycats and i put them on the tree to dry
289-121665-0041.flac,what are you doing with them i thought they belonged to my sheep answered bo peep sorrowfully
289-121665-0042.flac,i must hunt until i find those that belong to my sheep my dear said the old woman i have been deceiving you you said you knew all about your sheep and i wanted to teach you a lesson for however wise we may be
289-121665-0043.flac,no one in this world knows all about anything sheep do not have long tails there is only a little stump to answer for a tail neither do rabbits have tails nor bears nor many other animals
289-121665-0044.flac, and if you have been observing you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found
289-121665-0045.flac,so now little one run away home and try to be more thoughtful in the future your sheep will never miss the tails
289-121665-0046.flac, and now little bo peep no more did weep my tale of tails ends here
2893-139310-0000.flac,the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was glowing
2893-139310-0001.flac,a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre
2893-139310-0002.flac,behind the man was a girl in a silvery gray robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
2893-139310-0003.flac,a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch
2893-139310-0004.flac,and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly
2893-139310-0005.flac,he grasped the arm of this shouting person tell me he cried who am i who am i the others came nearer to hear his words
2893-139310-0006.flac,his eyes searched their faces they have told him nothing cried the girl tell me tell me cried graham you are the master of the earth you are owner of the world
2893-139310-0007.flac,he did not believe he heard a right he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i've been awake three days of prisoner three days
2893-139310-0008.flac,it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me
2893-139310-0009.flac, councillors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference
2893-139310-0010.flac,because you are the atlas sire who are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name the sounds from the hall had died into a silence
2893-139310-0011.flac,threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted
2893-139310-0012.flac, the people in the little room could not hear each other shout graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him
2893-139310-0013.flac,but who is ostrog he said
2893-139310-0014.flac,our leader in your name in my name
2893-139310-0015.flac, why is he not here he has deputed us i am his brother his half brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent
2893-139310-0016.flac,he's at the wind vane offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannized at last even in my name my name master
2893-139310-0017.flac,the young man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder
2893-139310-0018.flac,no one expected you to wake they were cunning damned tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotise you kill you again the hall dominated everything ostrog is at the wind vane offices ready
2893-139310-0019.flac,even now there is a rumour of fighting beginning the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him ostrog has it planned trust him we have our organisations ready we shall seize the flying stages
2893-139310-0020.flac,even now he may be doing that then this public theatre bawled the man in yellow is only a contingent we have five myriads of drilled men we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a leader
2893-139310-0021.flac,massed in the inaudible it is now or never the council is rocking they cannot trust even their drilled men hear the people calling to you graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds
2893-139310-0022.flac,now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism
2893-139310-0023.flac, on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
2893-139310-0024.flac, monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him
2893-139310-0025.flac,but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him
2893-139310-0026.flac,and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were bawling for order silence
2893-139310-0027.flac, a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth
2893-139310-0028.flac, he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed
2893-139310-0029.flac,but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of
2893-139310-0030.flac, lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman just ticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song
2893-139310-0031.flac,the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music music like the music of an organ
2893-139310-0032.flac, full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating time tramp tramp he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically
2893-139310-0033.flac, the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred him emboldened him the hall opened to him
2893-139310-0034.flac,wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtly folding mantle hung from his shoulders
2893-139310-0035.flac,he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant she became to him flushed an eager as she was an embodiment of the song
2893-139310-0036.flac,he emerged in the alcove again incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting guided by lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people
2893-139310-0037.flac,the hall was a vast and intricate space galleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity
2893-139310-0038.flac,the whole multitude was swaying in congested masses individual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him momentarily and lost definition again close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by three men
2893-139310-0039.flac,her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff next this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind shouted a hairless face a great cavity of toothless mouth a voice called
2893-139310-0040.flac,ostrog all his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song the multitude were beating time with their feet marking time tramp tramp tramp the green weapons waved
2893-139310-0041.flac, flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage remarking in front of him passing towards a great archway shouting to the council tramp tramp tramp he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled
2893-139310-0042.flac, march his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward they were no longer marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp tramp in that host
2893-139310-0043.flac, were bearded men old men youths fluttering robed bare armed women girls men and women of the new age rich robes grey rags fluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant blue
2893-139310-0044.flac,a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right he perceived a blue clad negro a shrivelled woman in yellow then a group of tall fair haired white faced blue clad men pushed theatrically past him he noted two chinamen
2893-139310-0045.flac,a tall sallow dark haired shining eyed youth white clad from top to toe clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down again and receded looking backward heads shoulders
2893-139310-0046.flac, hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there eyes met his and passed and vanished men gesticulated to him shouted inaudible personal things
2893-139310-0047.flac,most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly white and disease was there and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean men and women of the new age strange and incredible meeting as the broad stream passed before him to the right
2893-139310-0048.flac,tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people tramp tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages men and women
2893-139310-0049.flac, mingled in the ranks tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was tramping the garments waved onward the faces poured by more abundantly tramp tramp tramp tramp
2893-139310-0050.flac,at lincoln's pressure he turned toward the archway walking unconsciously in that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it the multitude the gesture and song all moved in that direction
2893-139310-0051.flac,the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet he was aware of a path before him of a suite about him of guards and dignities and lincoln on his right hand
2893-139310-0052.flac,attendance intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left before him when the backs of the guards in black three and three and three he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway
2893-139310-0053.flac,with the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up to him he did not know whither he went he did not want to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall
2893-139322-0000.flac,chapter twenty one the under side from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufactures was done
2893-139322-0001.flac,on their way the platform crossed the tems twice and passed in the broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid
2893-139322-0002.flac,the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights a string of black barges passed seaward manned by blue clad men
2893-139322-0003.flac,the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labour department was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks
2893-139322-0004.flac, struck graham most vividly one lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut
2893-139322-0005.flac,and blotted out the picture presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared
2893-139322-0006.flac,the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuit making place of the potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers
2893-139322-0007.flac,the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation
2893-139322-0008.flac,but wherever there was work it was being done by slow moving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the workplaces and the orange clad labour police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls
2893-139322-0009.flac,the voluntary vigours of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter day workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen
2893-139322-0010.flac,who were directing their labours the burly labourers of the old victorian times had followed that dray horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine
2893-139322-0011.flac,the latter day labourer male as well as female was essentially a machine minder and feeder a servant and attendant or an artist under direction the women in comparison with those graham remembered
2893-139322-0012.flac,whereas a class distinctly plain and flat chested two hundred years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion two hundred years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of femen and beauty and vigor from the blue canvas myriads
2893-139322-0013.flac, to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendours and delights and at last
2893-139322-0014.flac,to the youth and as he and peace to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of mainly nourished souls in the young cities of graham's former life the newly aggregated laboring mass
2893-139322-0015.flac, had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a high morality now it was differentiating into an instinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own even with a dialect of its own
2893-139322-0016.flac,they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits
2893-139322-0017.flac,the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways
2893-139322-0018.flac,he came to the warn of the jewelers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree
2893-139322-0019.flac,each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow
2893-139322-0020.flac, had the oddest effect the work was beautifully executed
2893-139322-0021.flac,for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this on coming to work but at night
2893-139322-0022.flac,in spite of every precaution the labour policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby
2893-139322-0023.flac, many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion asano apologised to graham for this offensive sight but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route
2893-139322-0024.flac,this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement she might have done better with herself than that said asano
2893-139322-0025.flac, graham made some indignant comments but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years
2893-139322-0026.flac, and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen three barges smothered in floury dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar
2893-139322-0027.flac, by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white washed wall
2893-139322-0028.flac,every now and then one would stop to cough a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky
2893-139322-0029.flac, their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing stop that shouted one of the policemen but the order was disobeyed
2893-139322-0030.flac,and first one and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp tramp
2893-139322-0031.flac,the policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things
2893-139322-0032.flac,that walk left on graham's mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery
2893-139322-0033.flac,the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pin point lights here was the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery
2893-139322-0034.flac, and here unprecedented reeks everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world
2893-139322-0035.flac,even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation once and again and again a third time
2893-139322-0036.flac, graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again
2893-139322-0037.flac,when he saw a number of blue clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labour police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder
2893-139322-0038.flac,but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms
2893-139322-0039.flac, they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices
2893-139322-0040.flac,then a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran what is happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting
2893-139322-0041.flac, that men yelled to one another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police
2893-139322-0042.flac,he hesitated looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew but how can they know asked asano graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work
2893-139322-0043.flac, and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms toward him bawling again and again in good english this is ostrog's doing ostrog the knave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse
2893-139322-0044.flac,he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream
2893-139322-0045.flac,he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past
2893-139322-0046.flac,the master is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent
2893-139322-0047.flac, he said i might have known the hour has come he thought swiftly what am i to do go back to the council house said asano why should i not appeal the people are here
2893-139322-0048.flac,you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them suppose this is only a rumour
2893-139322-0049.flac,it sounds true said asano let us have the facts said graham
2893-139322-0050.flac,even now the ruins may be impassable graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one and there asano had cost it a labourer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech what did he say as graham
2893-139322-0051.flac, had not someone in the wind vane offices learnt he said a girl a girl not he said a girl he did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins
2893-139322-0052.flac, and then another thing was shouted something that turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements it came like a wind along the street
2952-407-0000.flac, even to day in the courts of certain japanese temples you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose the largest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the jodo sect at hakata in kyushu
2952-407-0001.flac,who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for bell metal but afterwards she much regretted her mirror she remembered things that her mother had told her about it and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her mother but to her mother's mother and grandmother and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected
2952-407-0002.flac,but she had not the money necessary whenever she went to the temple she saw her mirror lying in the court yard behind a railing among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together she knew it by the sho chiku bai in relief on the back of it those three fortunate emblems of pine bamboo and plumflower
2952-407-0003.flac, which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and hide it that she might thereafter treasure it always but the chance did not come and she became very unhappy felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life
2952-407-0004.flac, a saying mystically expressed by the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody
2952-407-0005.flac, evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving she had not presented her offering with all her heart and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to the mirror kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace
2952-407-0006.flac,of course everybody heard of the matter and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt and because of this public exposure of her secret fault the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry and as she could not bear the shame she drowned herself
2952-407-0007.flac,after having written a farewell letter containing these words when i am dead it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell but to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it great wealth will be given by the ghost of me
2952-407-0008.flac,but the bell proved proved to be a good bell and it bravely withstood their assaults nevertheless the people were not easily discouraged day after day at all hours they continued to ring the bell furiously carrying nothing whatever for the protests of the priests
2952-407-0009.flac,so the ringing became an affliction and the priests could not endure it and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp the swamp was deep and swallowed it up and that was the end of the bell
2952-407-0010.flac, or bell of mugen now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied though not described by the verb
2952-407-0011.flac,the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith
2952-407-0012.flac,to compare to liken but the esoteric meaning is to substitute in imagination one object or action for another so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result
2952-407-0013.flac, for example you cannot afford to build a buddhist temple but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple
2952-407-0014.flac, you cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy one volumes of the buddhist texts but you can make a revolving library containing them turn round by pushing it like a windlass
2952-407-0015.flac,so much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazoraeru the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples but for present purposes the following will serve if you should make a little man of straw
2952-407-0016.flac,for the same reason that sister helen made a little man of wax and nail it
2952-407-0017.flac,that would illustrate one signification of nazoraeru or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them
2952-407-0018.flac,the soles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed and will allow him no rest until he returns of his own accord to put himself at your mercy that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazoraeru
2952-407-0019.flac,after the bell had been rolled into the swamp there was of course no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it
2952-407-0020.flac,but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble one of these persons was a woman called umegae
2952-407-0021.flac,while the pair were traveling together kajiwara one day found himself in great straits for want of money and umegae remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it
2952-407-0022.flac, crying out at the same time for three hundred pieces of gold a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping
2952-407-0023.flac,afterwards a song was made about umegae's basin of bronze and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day umegae no cho zwa chit tata itte
2952-407-0024.flac,if by striking upon the wash basin of umegae i could make honorable money come to me
2952-407-0025.flac,became great and many people followed the example of umegae thereby hoping to emulate her luck
2952-407-0026.flac,as it deserves to be answered take therefore this jar so saying she put the jar into his hands and disappeared into his house the happy man rushed to tell his wife the good news he sat down in front of her the covered jar which was heavy
2952-407-0027.flac,and they opened it together and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with
2952-408-0000.flac, jikininki once when muso kokushi
2952-408-0001.flac,for a long time he wandered about helplessly and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night when he perceived on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun one of those little hermitages called
2952-408-0002.flac,which are built for solitary priests it seemed to be in ruinous condition but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest from whom he begged the favor of a night's lodging
2952-408-0003.flac,this the old man harshly refused but he directed muso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining where lodging and food could be obtained muso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages
2952-408-0004.flac,but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man carrying a lighted lantern entered the room respectfully saluted him and said
2952-408-0005.flac,the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village
2952-408-0006.flac, strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village
2952-408-0007.flac,but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death when i came for though i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me i could have performed the service before your departure
2952-408-0008.flac,as it is i shall perform the service after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone
2952-408-0009.flac,then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the joining room having been told of the priest's kind promises came to thank him after which the master of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell
2952-408-0010.flac, by the rule of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are unable to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning
2952-408-0011.flac, all then left the house except the priest who went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp tomyo was burning
2952-408-0012.flac,the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village
2952-408-0013.flac,but when the hush of the night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak
2952-408-0014.flac,he saw that shape lift the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginning at the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body
2952-408-0015.flac,turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered
2952-408-0016.flac,and looked about the room no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverent sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night
2952-408-0017.flac,all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible but the law of our village as i told you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place
2952-408-0018.flac,and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been broken here to four some great misfortune has followed whenever it is obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause
2952-408-0019.flac,then muso told of a dim and awful shape that it entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed
2952-408-0020.flac,what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time muso then inquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked
2952-408-0021.flac,the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village answered muso i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment
2952-408-0022.flac,and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject
2952-408-0023.flac,for it was evident that his kind hosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived
2952-408-0024.flac, and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed
2952-408-0025.flac,you need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter said muso you directed me to the village yonder where i was very kindly treated and i thank you for that favor i can give no man shelter the recluse made answer
2952-408-0026.flac, so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rites only as a matter of business
2952-408-0027.flac,i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and because of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki
2952-408-0028.flac, since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverend sir
2952-408-0029.flac, help me by your prayers i entreat you so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant
2952-410-0000.flac, all the capacities of a daring and skillful soldier
2952-410-0001.flac, but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone and as his heart remained true to his former lord he preferred to give up the world so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest taking the buddhist name of kwairyo
2952-410-0002.flac,as in other years he had laughed at peril so now also he scorned danger
2952-410-0003.flac,so he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside he lay down there and prepared to sleep
2952-410-0004.flac,he had always welcomed discomfort and even a bare rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow his body was iron and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow
2952-410-0005.flac, scarcely had he lain down when a man came along the road carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood this woodcutter halted on seeing kwairyo lying down
2952-410-0006.flac, and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of great surprise what kind of a man can you be good sir that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this there are haunters about here many of them are you not afraid of hairy things
2952-410-0007.flac, my friend cheerfully answered kwairyo i am only a wandering priest a cloud and water guest as folks call it
2952-410-0008.flac,as for lonesome places i like them they are suitable for meditation i am accustomed to sleeping in the open air and i have learned never to be anxious about my life
2952-410-0009.flac, to lie down here this place has a bad name a very bad name but as the proverb has it kunshi ayayuki ni chikayorazu the superior man does not needlessly expose himself to peril
2952-410-0010.flac, and i must assure you sir that it is very dangerous to sleep here therefore although my house is only a wretched thatched hut let me beg of you to come home with me at once in the way of food i have nothing to offer you but there is a roof at least and you can sleep under it without risk
2952-410-0011.flac, accepted this modest offer the woodcutter guided him along a narrow path leading up from the main road through mountain forest it was a rough and dangerous path sometimes skirting precipices sometimes offering nothing but a network of
2952-410-0012.flac, slippery roots for the foot to rest upon sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock but at last kwairyo found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead and he saw before him a small thatched cottage
2952-410-0013.flac,and they must have been taught by some one well acquainted with the rules of propriety then turning to his host the aruji or house master as the others called him kwairyo said
2952-410-0014.flac, from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household i imagine that you have not always been a woodcutter perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes smiling the woodcutter answered sir you are not mistaken
2952-410-0015.flac,though now living as you find me i was once a person of some distinction my story is the story of a ruined life ruined by my own fault i used to be in the service of a daimyo and my rank in that service was not inconsiderable
2952-410-0016.flac, but i loved women and wine too well and under the influence of passion i acted wickedly
2952-410-0017.flac, retribution followed me and i long remained a fugitive in the land now i often pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did and to reestablish the ancestral home but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing
2952-410-0018.flac, kwairyo was pleased by this announcement of good resolve and he said to the aruji my friend i have had occasion to observe that man prone to folly in their youth may in after years become very earnest in right living
2952-410-0019.flac, in the holy sutras it is written that those strongest in wrong doing can become by power of good resolve the strongest in right doing i do not doubt that you have a good heart and i hope that better fortune will come to you
2952-410-0020.flac,to night i shall recite the sutras for your sake and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors with these assurances kwairyo bade the aruji good night and his host showed him to a very small side room where a bed had been made ready
2952-410-0021.flac, then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sutras by the light of a paper lantern until a late hour he continued to read and pray
2952-410-0022.flac,the night was beautiful there was no cloud in the sky there was no wind and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of foliage and glittered on the dews of the garden
2952-410-0023.flac, and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night kwairyo felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household
2952-410-0024.flac,very gently he pushed apart the sliding screens that separated his room from the main apartment and he saw by the light of the lantern five recumbent bodies without heads
2952-410-0025.flac,for one instant he stood bewildered imagining a crime but in another moment he perceived that there was no blood and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut then he thought to himself
2952-410-0026.flac, and remove the body to another place the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck and the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved it will strike itself upon the floor three times bouncing like a ball and bull pantas in great fear
2952-410-0027.flac,and presently die now if these be rokerokubi they mean me no good so i shall be justified in following the instructions of the book he seized the body of the aruji by the feet pulled it to the window and pushed it out
2952-410-0028.flac, gently unbarring the door he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it he heard voices talking in the grove and he went in the direction of the voices stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place
2952-410-0029.flac, then from behind a trunk he caught sight of the heads all five of them flitting about and chatting as they flitted they were eating worms and insects which they found on the ground or among the trees
2952-410-0030.flac,presently the head of the aruji stopped eating and said ah that traveling priest who came to night how fat all his body is when we shall have eaten him our bellies will be well filled i was foolish to talk to him as i did
2952-410-0031.flac,to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing
2952-410-0032.flac, another head the head of a young woman immediately rose up and flitted to the house lightly as a bat after a few minutes it came back and cried out huskily in a tone of great alarm that traveling priest is not in the house he is gone but that is not the worst of the matter
2952-410-0033.flac,he has taken the body of our aruji and i do not know where he has put it at this announcement the head of the aruji distinctly visible in the moonlight assumed a frightful aspect its eyes opened monstrously its hair stood up bristling and its teeth gnashed
2952-410-0034.flac, since my body has been moved to rejoin it is not possible then i must die and all through the work of that priest
2952-410-0035.flac,and there he is behind that tree hiding behind that tree see him the fat coward in the same moment the head of the aruji followed by the other four heads sprang at kwairyo
2952-410-0036.flac,but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree and with that tree he struck the heads as they came knocking them from him with tremendous blows four of them fled away but the head of the aruji though battered again and again desperately continued to bound at the priest
2952-410-0037.flac, and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe kwairyo however as quickly gripped the head by its top knot and repeatedly struck it it did not release its hold but uttered a long moan and thereafter ceased to struggle it was dead
2952-410-0038.flac,but its teeth still held the sleeve and for all his great strength kwairyo could not force open the jaws with the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house and there caught sight of the other four rokuro kubi squatting together
2952-410-0039.flac, with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies but when they perceived him at the back door all screamed the priest the priest and fled through the other doorway out into the woods eastward the sky was brightening day was about to dawn
2952-410-0040.flac,and kwairyo knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all fouled with blood and foam and clay and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself
2952-410-0041.flac,after which he gathered together his few belongings and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey right on he journeyed until he came to suwa
2952-410-0042.flac, seized the priest and took him to jail for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who in the moment of being killed had caught the murderer's sleeve in his teeth as the kwairyo he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him
2952-410-0043.flac, so after having passed a night in prison he was brought before the magistrates of the district then he was ordered to explain how he a priest had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people
2952-410-0044.flac, kwairyo laughed long and loudly at these questions and then he said sirs i did not fasten the head to my sleeve it fastened itself there much against my will and i have not committed any crime for this is not the head of a man it is the head of a goblet
2952-410-0045.flac,but the magistrates did not laugh they judged him to be a hardened criminal and his story an insult to their intelligence therefore without further questioning they decided to order his immediate execution all of them except one
2952-410-0046.flac, a very old man this aged officer had made no remark during the trial but after having heard the opinion of his colleagues he rose up and said let us first examine the head carefully for this i think has not yet been done
2952-410-0047.flac,the old man turned at round and round carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters he called the attention of his colleagues to these and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon
2952-410-0048.flac,on the contrary the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem then said the elder i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth this is the head of a rokuro kubi
2952-410-0049.flac,there are the characters you can see for yourselves that they have not been painted moreover it is well known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the province of kai from very ancient time but you sir he exclaimed turning to kwairyo
2952-410-0050.flac,perhaps you once belonged to the samurai class
2952-410-0051.flac,before becoming a priest i long followed the profession of arms and in those days i never feared man or devil my name then was isogai heidazaemon taketsura of kyushu there may be some among you who remember it
2952-410-0052.flac,at the mention of that name a murmur of admiration filled the court room for there were many present who remembered it and kwairyo immediately found himself among friends instead of judges friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness
2952-410-0053.flac,when kwairyo left sua he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world as for the head he took it with him jok costly insisting that he intended it for a mía gay and now it only remains to tell what became of the head
2952-410-0054.flac,a day or two after leaving suwa kwairyo met with a robber who stopped him in a lonesome place and bade him strip kwairyo at once removed his koromu and offered it to the robber who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve
2952-410-0055.flac,though brave the highwayman was startled he dropped the garment and sprang back then he cried out you
2952-410-0056.flac, kwairyo answered i shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist but i must tell you that this is not the head of a man it is a goblin's head so if you buy it and have any trouble in consequence please to remember that you were not deceived by me
2952-410-0057.flac, what a nice priest you are exclaimed the robber you kill men and jest about it but i am really in earnest here is my robe and here is the money and let me have the head what is the use of joking
2952-410-0058.flac,take the thing said kwairyo i was not joking
2952-410-0059.flac,and he then became afraid that the spirit of the rokuro kubi might give him trouble so he made up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had come and to bury it with its body he found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of kai but nobody was there
2952-410-0060.flac,and he could not discover the body therefore he buried the head by itself in the grove behind the cottage and he had a tombstone set up over the grave and he caused a segaki service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the rokuro kubi
2989-138028-0000.flac, chapter six of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper one of the most important chapters in the whole history
2989-138028-0001.flac,but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home
2989-138028-0002.flac,what answer god will give to your complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer either i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they present every day
2989-138028-0003.flac,and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him where upon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majesty's court are there no knights there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right there should be
2989-138028-0004.flac,to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the king's majesty then might not your worship said she be one of those that without stirring a step serve their king and lord in his court
2989-138028-0005.flac,there must be all sorts in the world
2989-138028-0006.flac,there is a great difference between one and another for the courtiers without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst
2989-138028-0007.flac,but we the true knights errant measure the whole earth with our own feet exposed to the sun to the cold to the air to the inclemencies of heaven by day and night on foot and on horseback
2989-138028-0008.flac,nor do we only know enemies in pictures but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword
2989-138028-0009.flac,whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing about but i do
2989-138028-0010.flac,and you must know besides that the true knight errant though he may see ten giants that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them and that go each of them on two tall towers by way of legs and his arms are like the mass of mighty ships and each eye like a great mill wheel
2989-138028-0011.flac,and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish
2989-138028-0012.flac, wheeled trenchant blades of damascus steel or clubs studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than once seen
2989-138028-0013.flac,and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second or more properly speaking first kind of knights errant for as we read in their histories
2989-138028-0014.flac, i would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights errant
2989-138028-0015.flac,for he was the most humble minded and courteous knight of his time
2989-138028-0016.flac,but some there are that might have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for they are not all courteous or mannerly some are ill conditioned scoundrels nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck
2989-138028-0017.flac,and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen
2989-138028-0018.flac,god bless me said the niece that you should know so much uncle
2989-138028-0019.flac,and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above all a cuba yero when you are not one
2989-138028-0020.flac,all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintained them
2989-138028-0021.flac, and still maintained and uphold the greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended at a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness
2989-138028-0022.flac,those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve
2989-138028-0023.flac,for examples of the second sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it
2989-138028-0024.flac,of countless princes monarchs lords medes assyrians persians greeks and barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing
2989-138028-0025.flac,for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants and even should we find one it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebeian lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
2989-138028-0026.flac,and not by spending as he pleases but by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable well bred courteous gentlemanored and kindly not haughty arrogant or censorous
2989-138028-0027.flac,but above all by being charitable for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues i have named
2989-138028-0028.flac,even though he know him not will fail to recognize and set him down as one of good blood and it would be strange where it not so praise has ever been the reward of virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation
2989-138028-0029.flac,there are two roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and honors one is that of letters the other that of arms
2989-138028-0030.flac,i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road
2989-138028-0031.flac,and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills fate ordains reason requires and above all my own inclination favours for knowing as i do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight errantry
2989-138028-0032.flac,i know too the infinite blessings that are attained by it another the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of vise broad and spacious i know their ends and goals are different for the broad and easy road of vise ends in death
2989-138028-0033.flac,i know as our great castilian poet says that it is by rugged paths like these they go that scale the heights of immortality unreached by those that falter here below
2989-138028-0034.flac,i can tell you niece replied don quixote if these chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties there would be nothing that i could not do nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands particularly cages and tooth picks
2989-138028-0035.flac, at this moment there came a knocking at the door
2989-138028-0036.flac,nothing senor samson said she only that my master is breaking out plainly breaking out whereabouts is he breaking out senora asked samson has any part of his body burst he is only breaking out at the door of his madness she replied
2989-138028-0037.flac,so that to bring him round again ever so little cost me more than six hundred eggs
2989-138028-0038.flac,that i can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress housekeeper that is all
2989-138028-0039.flac,say the prayer of santa apollonia that is if you know it for i will come presently and you will see miracles woe is me cried the housekeeper
2989-138028-0040.flac,that would do if it was the toothache my master had
2989-138028-0041.flac, i know what i am saying mistress housekeeper
2989-138028-0042.flac, replied carrasco and with this the housekeeper retired
2989-138028-0043.flac, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place
2989-138028-0044.flac, once or twice as well as i remember replied sancho
2989-138028-0045.flac,for i know not what i am so focile means
2989-138028-0046.flac,and submit to what i teach thee i would bet said sancho that from the very first you understood me and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders may be so replied don quixote
2989-138028-0047.flac,but to come to the point what does teresa say teresa says
2989-138028-0048.flac,and so say i said don quixote continue sancho my friend go on you talk pearls to day the fact is continued sancho
2989-138028-0049.flac,and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased to give him
2989-138028-0050.flac,and that the same he paid me out of your estate for i don't care to stand on rewards which either come late or ill or never at all god help me with my own
2989-138028-0051.flac, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost
2989-138028-0052.flac,and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs
2989-138028-0053.flac,please to return to my service well and good but to suppose that i am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of knight errantry is all nonsense and so my sancho get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your teresa
2989-138028-0054.flac, bin a quidem but if not we remain friends for if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not lack pigeons and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and a good grievance better than a bad compensation
2989-138028-0055.flac,and in short i mean to say and i do say that if you don't like to come on reward with me and run the same chance that i run god be with you
2989-138028-0056.flac,the arch wag samson came forward and embracing him as he had done before said with a loud voice o flower of knight errantry o shining light of arms o honour and mirror of the spanish nation
2989-138028-0057.flac,may god almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons who would impede or hinder thy third sally may find no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes nor ever accomplish what they most desire and then turning to the housekeeper he said
2989-138028-0058.flac,for i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did i not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit
2989-138028-0059.flac,any longer curbed and checked for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs
2989-138028-0060.flac, of the honour of virgins of the aid of widows and of the support of wives and other matters of this kind appertaining belonging proper and peculiar
2989-138028-0061.flac,on then my lord don quixote beautiful and brave let your worship and highness set out to day rather than to morrow and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose
2989-138028-0062.flac,with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight errand squire but heaven forbid that to gratify my own inclination i should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessels of the sciences and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts
2989-138028-0063.flac,let this new samson remain in his own country and bringing honour to it bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents for i will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not deign to accompany me
2989-138028-0064.flac, the bread eaten and the company dispersed
2989-138028-0065.flac,who the ponses from whom i am descended were and what is more i know and have learned
2989-138028-0066.flac,no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow which i can't deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take it amiss
2989-138028-0067.flac,and so there's nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its cause as still in such a way that it can't be provoked
2989-138028-0068.flac,so i offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally as well and better than all the squires that served knights errant in times past or present
2989-138028-0069.flac,as he was there described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be revoked
2989-138028-0070.flac,in fine don quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who was now their oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence by which time they could have
2989-138028-0071.flac,all that was requisite for the journey ready and procure a closed helmet which don quixote said he must by all means take samson offered him one as he knew a friend of his
2989-138028-0072.flac, poured out on the bachelor were past counting they tore their hair they clawed their faces and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion
2989-138028-0073.flac, samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on
2989-138028-0074.flac,with whom he had previously discussed the subject
2989-138028-0075.flac,his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals and his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former
2989-138035-0000.flac,in which is related the adventure of the enamoured shepherd together with other truly droll incidents don quixote had gone but a short distance beyond don diego's village when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students and a couple of peasants
2989-138035-0001.flac,and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that everyone felt who saw don quixote for the first time and were dying to know who this man so different from ordinary men could be don quixote saluted them and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his
2989-138035-0002.flac, made them an offer of his company and begged them to slacken their pace as their young asses travelled faster than his horse and then to gratify them he told them in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed
2989-138035-0003.flac,which was that of a night errands seeking adventures in all parts of the world he informed them that his own name was don quixote of la monta and that he was called by way of surname the night of the lions all this was greek or jibberish to the peasants
2989-138035-0004.flac,for all that however they regarded him with admiration and respect and one of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed road as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship come with us
2989-138035-0005.flac, who is called par excellence
2989-138035-0006.flac,as the bridegroom is called camacho the rich she is eighteen and he twenty two and they are fairly matched though some knowing ones who have all the pedigries in the world by heart will have it that the family of the fairy quiteria is better than camacho's
2989-138035-0007.flac,but no one minds that now a days for wealth can sold her a great many flaws at any rate come what you as free handed
2989-138035-0008.flac,he has provided dances too not only sore but also bell dancers for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection of few dancers i say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things
2989-138035-0009.flac,nor of the many others i have omitted to mention
2989-138035-0010.flac,and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents
2989-138035-0011.flac,so that the loves of the two children basilio and quiteria
2989-138035-0012.flac,he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich camacho
2989-138035-0013.flac,who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the truth be told ungrudgingly he is the most agile youth we know a mighty thrower of the bar a first rate wrestler and a great ball player he runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat
2989-138035-0014.flac,bowls over the nine pins as if by magic
2989-138035-0015.flac, and above all handles a sword as well as the best
2989-138035-0016.flac,say that to my wife said sancho who had until now listened in silence for she won't hear of anything but each one marrying his equal holding with the proverb each ewe to her like
2989-138035-0017.flac,if all those who love one another were to marry said don quixote it would deprive parents of the right to choose and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased
2989-138035-0018.flac,one would be for choosing her father's servant and another some one she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken bully
2989-138035-0019.flac,and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error
2989-138035-0020.flac,why then should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting place of death more especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed at board and everywhere as the wife is to her husband
2989-138035-0021.flac,he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter rational word and he always goes about moody and dejected talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses he eats little and sleeps little and all he eats is fruit and when he sleeps
2989-138035-0022.flac, if he sleeps at all it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast sometimes he gazes at the sky
2989-138035-0023.flac,that he might be taken for a clothed statue with its drapery stirred by the wind in short he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering that all we who know him
2989-138035-0024.flac, and any one of them or any moment the house may fall i have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all at one time
2989-138035-0025.flac,and tell me is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune no faith and between a woman's yes and no i wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin
2989-138035-0026.flac,for love i have heard say
2989-138035-0027.flac,poverty wealth and blear eyes pearls what art thou driving at sancho curses on thee said don quixote
2989-138035-0028.flac,no one can understand thee but judas himself and i wish he had thee tell me thou animal what dost thou know about nails or wheels or anything else oh if you don't understand me replied sancho it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense
2989-138035-0029.flac,but no matter i understand myself and i know i have not said anything very foolish in what i have said only your worship senor is always gravelling at everything i say nay everything i do
2989-138035-0030.flac,maybe there are toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk that is true said the licentiate for those who have been bred up in the tanneries
2989-138035-0031.flac,and yet they are all toledans pure correct
2989-138035-0032.flac,though they may have been born in majalahonda i say of discrimination because there are many who are not so and discrimination is the grammar of good language if it be accompanied by practice i sirs for my sins have studied canon law at salamanca
2989-138035-0033.flac, where you are now tale look here bachelor cortriolo returned the licentiate you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword if you think it useless it is no idea on my part but an established truth
2989-138035-0034.flac,and these joined with my resolution which is not small will make you confess that i am not mistaken dismount and put in practice your positions and circles and angles and science for i hope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship
2989-138035-0035.flac,who will make me turn my back and that there is not one in the world i will not compel to give ground as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself replied the master of fence
2989-138035-0036.flac,though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you placed your foot the first time i mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword
2989-138035-0037.flac,but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the licentiate's sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset and made him kiss it as if it were a relic though not as devoutly as relics are and ought to be kissed
2989-138035-0038.flac,the end of it was that the licentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short cassock he wore tore the skirts into strips like the tails of a cuttlefish knocked off his hat twice and so completely tired him out
2989-138035-0039.flac,that in vexation anger and rage he took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force that one of the peasants that were there who was a notary and who went for it made an affidavit afterwards that he sent it nearly three quarters of a league
2989-138035-0040.flac,by my faith senor bachelor if your worship takes my advice you will never challenge anyone to fence again only to wrestle and throw the bar for you have the youth and strength for that but as for these fencers as they call them i have heard say
2989-138035-0041.flac,they can put the point of a sword through the eye of a needle i am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey said corchuelo and with having had the truth i was so ignorant of proved to me by experience and getting up he embraced the licentiate
2989-138035-0042.flac,and they were better friends than ever and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword
2989-138035-0043.flac,they resolved to push on so as to reach the village of quiteria to which they all belonged in good time during the remainder of the journey though they licentiate held forth to them on the excellences of the sword with such conclusive arguments and such figures and mathematical proofs
2989-138035-0044.flac,it grew dark but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it they heard too the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments flutes drums
2989-138035-0045.flac, placealtaries pipes
2989-138035-0046.flac, were filled with lights unaffected by the wind for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees the musicians were the life of the wedding wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands some dancing
2989-138035-0047.flac,others singing others playing the various instruments already mentioned
2989-138035-0048.flac, were frisking and gambling all over the metal
2989-138035-0049.flac,even were it under gilded ceilings and so turned aside a little out of the road
2989-138035-0050.flac, as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don diego came back to his mind
2989-138035-0051.flac, wherein an account is given up the wedding of camacho the rich together with the incident of basilio the poor
2989-138035-0052.flac, scarce had the fair aurora given bright phoebus time to dry the liquid pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays when don quixote shaking off sloth from his limbs
2989-138035-0053.flac, sprang to his feet and called to his squire sancho who was still snoring
2989-138035-0054.flac,that without envying or being envied sleepest
2989-138035-0055.flac,to interfere with thy repose ambition breaks not thy rest nor doth this world's empty pomp disturb thee for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass
2989-138035-0056.flac,since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the support of thyself the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom have imposed upon masters the servant sleeps and the master lies awake thinking how he is to feed him advance him and reward him
2989-138035-0057.flac,he awoke at last drowsy and lazy and casting his eyes about in every direction observed there comes if i don't mistake
2989-138035-0058.flac,a wedding that begins with smells like that by my faith ought to be plentiful and unstinting have done thou glutton said don quixote come let us go and witness this bridal and see what the rejected basilio does
2989-138035-0059.flac,let him do what he likes returned sancho be he not poor he would marry quiteria to make a grand match for himself and he without a farthing is there nothing else faith
2989-138035-0060.flac,senor it's my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get
2989-138035-0061.flac,and if that be so as no doubt it is
2989-138035-0062.flac,but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash i wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are
2989-138035-0063.flac,for god's sake sancho said don quixote here
2989-138035-0064.flac,one of them was that i was to be let say all i liked so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship's authority and so far it seems to me i have not broken the said article
2989-138035-0065.flac, and even if it were so i desire you to hold your tongue and come along for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning and not in the heat of the afternoon
2989-138035-0066.flac,and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots for they were six half wine jars each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house
2989-138035-0067.flac,they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons
2989-138035-0068.flac, of over six gallons each and all filled as it proved afterwards with generous wines there were besides piles of the widest bread like the heaps of corn wences on the threshing floors
2989-138035-0069.flac,there was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick work and two cauldrons full of oil
2989-138035-0070.flac, and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by of hooks and cookmates there were over fifty all clean brisk and blithe in the capatious belly of the ox where it doesn't solve little suckling pigs which sown up there
2989-138035-0071.flac,the spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter and all lay open to view in a great chest
2989-138035-0072.flac, but abundant enough to feed an army
2989-138035-0073.flac, contemplated all and everything won his heart the first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots
2989-138035-0074.flac,get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two a much good may they do you i don't see one says sancho wait a bit said the cook center that i am how particular and bashful you are
2989-138035-0075.flac, and so saying he seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese
2989-138035-0076.flac, fall too friend and take the edged off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner time comes
2989-138035-0077.flac,well then said the cook take spoon and all for camacho's wealth and happiness furnish everything
2989-138035-0078.flac,don quixote was watching the entrance at one end of the arcade of some twelve peasants all in holiday and gala dress
311-124404-0000.flac, i would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which i deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions
311-124404-0001.flac,i believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truths are that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would induce to the public advantage
311-124404-0002.flac,i have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which i have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of god and of the soul
311-124404-0003.flac,and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had formerly appeared and yet i venture to state that not only have i found means
311-124404-0004.flac, to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner
311-124404-0005.flac,and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering
311-124404-0006.flac, but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade
311-124404-0007.flac, fearing lest i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind i resolved to expound singly though at considerable length my opinions regarding light then
311-124404-0008.flac, to take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and to take on the sun and fix stars since light almost wholly proceeds from them on the heavens since they transmitted on the planet's comets and earth since they reflected and particularly
311-124404-0009.flac, on all the bodies that are upon the earth since they are either colored or transparent or luminous and finally on man since he is the spectator of these objects
311-124404-0010.flac, further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned
311-124404-0011.flac,i resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces
311-124404-0012.flac, matter sufficient to compose one and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned
311-124404-0013.flac,and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established on this supposition i in the first place described this matter
311-124404-0014.flac, and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul
311-124404-0015.flac,for i even expressly supposed that it possess none of those forms or qualities which are so debated in the schools nor in general anything the knowledge of which is not so natural to our minds
311-124404-0016.flac, i endeavored to demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt
311-124404-0017.flac,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way
311-124404-0018.flac, as to present the appearance of heavens how in the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets and others as sun as to fix stars and making a digression at this stage on the subject of light
311-124404-0019.flac, i expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be
311-124404-0020.flac,and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth to this i likewise added much respecting the substance the situation the motions
311-124404-0021.flac, and all the different qualities of these heavens and stars so that i thought i had said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in the heavens or stars of our system that must not or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which i described
311-124404-0022.flac, i came next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i had expressly supposed that god had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly
311-124404-0023.flac, to that observed in our seas as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such as is likewise observed between the tropics how the mountains seas fountains and rivers might naturally be formed in it
311-124404-0024.flac,and the metals produced in the mines and the plants grow in the fields and in general how all the bodies which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and among other things in the discoveries alluded to
311-124404-0025.flac,i knew nothing except fire which produces light i spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature the manner of its production and support and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light and light without heat
311-124404-0026.flac, to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others how it can consume almost all bodies or convert them into ashes and smoke
311-124404-0027.flac, and finally how from these ashes
311-124404-0028.flac,for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature i took a special pleasure in describing it i was not however disposed from these circumstances
311-124404-0029.flac, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described
311-124404-0030.flac,but this is certain and an opinion commonly received among theologians that the action by which he now sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it
311-124404-0031.flac, so that even although he had from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos provided only he had established certain laws of nature and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do
311-124404-0032.flac,it may be believed without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone things purely material might in course of time
311-124404-0033.flac, from the description of inanimate bodies and plants i passed to animals and particularly to man
311-124404-0034.flac,but since i had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the rest that is to say by deducing effects from their causes and by showing
311-124404-0035.flac, nature must produce them i remained satisfied with the supposition that god formed the body of men wholly like the one of ours as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal confirmation of the organs
311-124404-0036.flac, of the same matter with that i had described and at first placed in it no rational soul nor any other principle in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light
311-124404-0037.flac, and which i thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit for when i examined the kind of functions which might
311-124404-0038.flac, as consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently
311-124404-0039.flac,consists in thinking functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us but among which i could not discover any of those that as dependent on thought alone belong to us as men
311-124404-0040.flac, while on the other hand i did afterwards discover these as soon as i supposed god to have created a rational soul and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which i described
311-124404-0041.flac,will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest
311-124404-0042.flac, to take the trouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large animal possessed of lungs
311-124404-0043.flac,and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tubes viz the hollow vein vena cava
311-124404-0044.flac,which is the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately so denominated
311-124404-0045.flac, presently dispersed themselves all over the lungs in the second place the cavity in the left side
311-124404-0046.flac, two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs
311-124404-0047.flac,where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein and those of the tube called the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issuing from the heart sends its branches all over the body
311-124404-0048.flac, i should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the eleven pellicules which like so many small valves open and shut for orifices that are in these two cavities visit
311-124404-0049.flac,three at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out three at the entrance to the arterial vein
311-124404-0050.flac, which arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former readily permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity and in like manner
311-124404-0051.flac, two others at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but preclude its return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart
311-124404-0052.flac, but prevent its reflux nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation can be adequately closed with two
311-124404-0053.flac,whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture
311-124404-0054.flac,and there form as it were two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body
311-124404-0055.flac, and finally that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel
311-124404-0056.flac,for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood
311-124404-0057.flac,into these the blood of necessity flows from the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these two vessels are always full of blood and their orifices which are turned towards the heart cannot then be closed
311-124404-0058.flac,because the orifices through which they pass are wide
311-124404-0059.flac, are immediately rarefied and dilated by the heat they meet with in this way they cause the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances
311-124404-0060.flac, of the two vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels through which they pass out
311-124404-0061.flac,causing in this way all the branches of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract as do also the arteries
311-124404-0062.flac,and the six small valves close and the five of the hollow
311-124404-0063.flac,vainus artery opened a new and allow a passage
311-124404-0064.flac, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before and because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes
311-124404-0065.flac,it thence happens that their motion is the contrary of that of the heart and that when it expands they contract but lest those who are ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish
311-124404-0066.flac, true reasons from mere verisimilitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily
311-124404-0067.flac,from the very arrangement of the parts which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience as does the motion of a clock from the power
311-124404-0068.flac, the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted
311-124404-0069.flac,and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins
311-124404-0070.flac,so that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation of this we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons who by binding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where they open the vein
311-124404-0071.flac,cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature whereas quite the contrary would happen were they to bind it below that is between the hand and the opening or were to make the ligature above
311-124404-0072.flac, the opening very tight for it is manifest that the tie moderately straightened while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins cannot on that account prevent new blood
311-124404-0073.flac, from coming forward through the arteries because these are situated below the veins and their coverings from their greater consistency are more difficult to compress and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them
311-124404-0074.flac,to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins there must of necessity
311-124404-0075.flac, which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut
311-124404-0076.flac,so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there are many other circumstances which evince that what i have alleged
311-124404-0077.flac,is the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins and that from the arteries can only arise from this
311-124404-0078.flac, and more vivid and warmer immediately after leaving the heart in other words when in the arteries than it was a short time before passing into either in other words when it was in the veins
311-124404-0079.flac,and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart
311-124404-0080.flac, in parts more remote from it in the next place
311-124404-0081.flac, sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins and why should the left cavity of the heart
311-124404-0082.flac, and the arterial vein were it not that the blood of the venous artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and rarefies more readily and in a higher degree
311-124404-0083.flac,once it happens that if the blood be withdrawn for many parts the heat is likewise withdrawn but the same means and although the heart were as hot as glowing iron it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands
311-124404-0084.flac,and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb
311-124404-0085.flac, when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times in a day
311-124404-0086.flac,and the production of the different humors of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being rarefied passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive
311-124404-0087.flac,and there occupy the place of some others expelled by them and that according to the situation shape or smallness of the pores with which they meet some rather than others flow into certain parts
311-124404-0088.flac, which by being variously perforated serve to separate different species of grain and in the last place what above all is here worthy of observation
311-124404-0089.flac,is the generation of the animal spirits which are like a very subtle wind or rather a very pure and vivid flame which
311-124404-0090.flac, ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain thence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles and gives motion to all the members so that to account for other parts of the blood which as most agitated and penetrating
311-124404-0091.flac, proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart
311-124404-0092.flac, in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same within those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point
311-124404-0093.flac, which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it
311-124404-0094.flac,i had expanded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in a treatise which i formerly thought of publishing and after these i had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscle of the human body
311-124404-0095.flac, to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth although no longer animated what changes must take place in the brain to produce
311-124404-0096.flac, waking sleep and dreams how light sounds odors tastes heat and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means of the senses how hunger
311-124404-0097.flac, thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon its diverse ideas what must be understood by the common sense those communes in which these ideas are received by the memory which pertains them
311-124404-0098.flac, by the fantasy which can change them in various ways and out of them compose new ideas and which by the same means distributing the animal spirits through the muscles can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways
311-124404-0099.flac,to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata or moving machines fabricated by human industry and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones
311-124404-0100.flac, muscles nerves arteries veins and other parts that are found in the body of each animal such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of god which is incomparably better arranged
311-124404-0101.flac, and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine of human invention and here i specially stayed to show that were there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal
311-124404-0102.flac,we could have no means of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals but if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible
311-124404-0103.flac, our thoughts to others for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs
311-124404-0104.flac,for example if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it is hurt and such like
311-124404-0105.flac,appositely to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us
311-124404-0106.flac,these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient
311-124404-0107.flac,that there are no men so dull and stupid not even idiots as to be incapable of joining together different words and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood
311-124404-0108.flac,destitute of the organs which others use in speaking are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their thoughts to those who being usually in their company have leisure to learn their language
311-124404-0109.flac,and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak
311-124404-0110.flac,and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species as well as among men and since some are more capable of being instructed than others it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species
311-124404-0111.flac, should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack brained unless the soul of brutes
311-124404-0112.flac,and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brutes speak although we do not understand their language
311-124404-0113.flac, since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows
311-124404-0114.flac, that though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others so that the circumstance that they do better
311-124404-0115.flac,and could surpass us in all things on the contrary it rather proves that they are a destitute of reason and that it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs thus it is seen that a clock composed only of wheels and wades
311-124404-0116.flac,can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter
311-124404-0117.flac,as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members
311-124404-0118.flac,but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man
311-124404-0119.flac,there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue
311-124404-0120.flac,and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for or fear more than flies and ants in place of which when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the reasons which establish
311-124404-0121.flac, because no other causes are observer capable of destroying it
3240-131231-0000.flac, attempts to preserve the system that small frogs and toads for instance never have fallen from the sky but were on the ground in the first place or that there have been such falls up from one place in a whirlwind and down in another
3240-131231-0001.flac, were there some especially froggy place near europe as there is an especially sandy place the scientific explanation would of course be that all small frogs falling from the sky in europe come from that center of frogeity to start with
3240-131231-0002.flac, i'd like to emphasize something that i am permitted to see because i am still primitive or intelligent or in a state of maladjustment
3240-131231-0003.flac, of a fall of tadpoles from the sky as to there in the first place
3240-131231-0004.flac,the writer says that all observers were mistaken that the frogs or toads must have fallen from trees or other places overhead tremendous number of little toads one or two months old
3240-131231-0005.flac, that were seen to fall from a great thick cloud that appeared suddenly in a sky that had been cloudless august eighteen o four near toulouse france according to a letter from professor pontus to m arago
3240-131231-0006.flac, many instances of frogs that were seen to fall from the sky
3240-131231-0007.flac,as to having been there in the first place

3240-131231-0009.flac,little toads found in a desert after a rainfall notes and queries
3240-131231-0010.flac,to start with i do not deny positively the conventional explanation of up and down i think that there may have been such occurrences i omit many notes that i have upon indistinguishables
3240-131231-0011.flac,in the london times july fourth eighteen eighty three there is an account of a shower of twigs and leaves and tiny toads in a storm upon the slopes of the apennines these may have been the ejectamenta of a whirlwind i add however
3240-131231-0012.flac, that i have notes upon two other falls of tiny toads in eighteen eighty three one in france and one in tahiti also of fish in scotland but in the phenomenon of the apennines the mixture seems to me to be typical of the products of a whirlwind
3240-131231-0013.flac, the other instances seem to me to be typical of something like migration their great numbers and their homogeneity over and over in these annals of the damned occurs the datum of segregation
3240-131231-0014.flac,but a whirlwind is thought of as a condition of chaos quasi chaos
3240-131231-0015.flac,monthly weather review july eighteen eighty one a small pond in the track of the cloud was sucked dry the water being carried over the adjoining fields together with a large quantity of soft mud which was scattered over the ground for half a mile around
3240-131231-0016.flac,but here are the circumstances of a scoop in the exclusionist imagination there is no regard for mud debris from the bottom of a pond floating vegetation loose things from the shores but a precise picking out of frogs only
3240-131231-0017.flac, of all instances i have that attribute the fall of small frogs or toads to whirlwinds only one definitely identifies or places the whirlwind also as has been said before upon going up would be quite as interesting as frogs coming down
3240-131231-0018.flac, whirlwinds we read of over and over but where and what whirlwind it seems to me that anybody who had lost a pond would be heard from in symons meteorological magazine
3240-131231-0019.flac,a fall of small frogs near birmingham england june thirtieth eighteen ninety two is attributed to a specific whirlwind but not a word as to any special pond that had contributed
3240-131231-0020.flac,and something that strikes my attention here is that these frogs are described as almost white i'm afraid there is no escape for us we shall have to give to civilization upon this earth some new worlds places with white frogs in them
3240-131231-0021.flac, in spite of all we think we know of the accelerative velocity of falling bodies and have propagated why the exotic becomes the indigenous or from the strangest of places we'd expect the familiar or
3240-131231-0022.flac, if hosts of living frogs have come here from somewhere else every living thing upon this earth may ancestrally have come from somewhere else i find that i have another note upon a specific hurricane
3240-131231-0023.flac,after one of the greatest hurricanes in the history of ireland some fish were found as far as fifteen yards from the edge of a lake have another this is a good one for the exclusionists fall of fish in paris said that a neighboring pond had been blown dry
3240-131231-0024.flac,date not given but i have seen it recorded somewhere else the best known fall of fishes from the sky is that which occurred at mountain ash
3240-131231-0025.flac, february eleventh eighteen fifty nine the editor of the surologist
3240-131231-0026.flac, having published a report of a fall of fishes writes i am continually receiving similar accounts of frogs and fishes but in all the volumes of the zoologist i can find only two reports of such falls there is nothing to conclude
3240-131231-0027.flac, other than that hosts of data have been lost because orthodoxy does not look favorably upon such reports the monthly weather review records several falls of fishes in the united states
3240-131231-0028.flac, nevertheless the treatment by the zoologist of the fall reported from mountain ash is fair first appears
3240-131231-0029.flac, vicar of abedare asserting that the fall had occurred chiefly upon the property of mister nixon of mountain ash
3240-131231-0030.flac,of the british museum bristling with exclusionism writes that some of these fishes which had been sent to him alive were very young minnows he says on reading the evidence it seems to me most probably only a practical joke
3240-131231-0031.flac,the editor says that one was a minnow and that the rest were sticklebacks he says that doctor gray's explanation is no doubt right but
3240-131231-0032.flac,he publishes a letter from another correspondent who apologizes for opposing so high an authority as doctor gray but says that he had obtained some of these fishes from persons who lived at a considerable distance apart
3240-131231-0033.flac, or considerably out of range of the playful pail of water according to the annual register
3240-131231-0034.flac,the fishes themselves had fallen by pailfuls if these fishes were not upon the ground in the first place we base our objections to the whirlwind explanation upon two data that they fell in no such distribution as one could attribute to the discharge of a whirlwind
3240-131231-0035.flac, that ten minutes later another fall of fishes occurred upon this same narrow strip of land even arguing that a whirlwind may stand still actually it discharges tangentially wherever the fishes came from it does not seem thinkable
3240-131231-0036.flac, that some could have fallen and that others could have whirled even a tenth of a minute then falling directly after the first to fall because of these evil circumstances the best adaptation was to laugh the whole thing off
3240-131231-0037.flac, very young minnows had been caught up in the london times march second eighteen fifty nine is a letter from mister aaron roberts curate of saint peter's carmathon in this letter
3240-131231-0038.flac,but there is some question of species i think myself that they were minnows and sticklebacks some persons thinking them to be sea fishes placed them in salt water according to mister roberts
3240-131231-0039.flac, some were placed in fresh water these seemed to thrive well as to narrow distribution we are told that the fishes fell in and about the premises of mister nixon it was not observed at the time that any fish fell in any other part of the neighborhood
3240-131231-0040.flac, save in the particular spot mentioned in the london times march tenth eighteen fifty nine vicar griffith writes an account the roofs of some houses were covered with them
3240-131231-0041.flac, in this letter it is said that the largest fishes were five inches long and that these did not survive the fall report of the british association
3240-131231-0042.flac,the evidence of the fall of fish on this occasion was very conclusive a specimen of the fish was exhibited
3240-131231-0043.flac,leirus gasterosteus is the stickleback altogether i think we have not a sense of total perdition
3240-131231-0044.flac, in which were thousands of fishes four or five inches long some of which covered roofs of houses and some of which remained ten minutes in the air by way of contrast we offer our own acceptance that the bottom of a super geographical pond had dropped out
3240-131231-0045.flac, i have agreed many notes upon the fall of fishes despite the difficulty these records have in getting themselves published but i pick out the instances that especially relate to our super geographical acceptances
3240-131231-0046.flac,that have fallen with a distribution narrower than is attributable to a whirlwind that have fallen for a considerable length of time upon the same narrow area of land these three factors indicate somewhere not far aloft
3240-131231-0047.flac,a region of inertness to this earth's gravitation of course however a region that by the flux and variation of all things must at times be susceptible but afterward our heresy will bifurcate
3240-131231-0048.flac,in amiable accommodation to the crucifixion it'll get i think but so impressed are we with the datum that though there have been many reports of small frogs that have fallen from the sky
3240-131231-0049.flac,that to these circumstances another adjustment must be made apart from our three factors of indication an extraordinary observation is the fall of living things without injury to them
3240-131231-0050.flac, something else apart from our three main interests is a phenomenon that looks like what one might call an alternating series of falls of fishes whatever the significance may be

3240-131231-0057.flac, disregarding serial significance or mechanical unintelligent repulsive reflex is that the fishes of india did not fall from the sky that they were found upon the ground after torrential rains because streams had overflowed and had then receded
3240-131231-0058.flac, in the region of inertness that we think we can conceive of or a zone that is to this earth's gravitation very much like the neutral zone of a magnet's attraction we accept that there are bodies of water and also clear spaces bottoms of ponds dropping out

3240-131231-0063.flac,the most strange thing whichever struck me was that the fish did not fall helter sculptor or here and there but they fell in a straight line not more than a cubit in breadth
3240-131231-0064.flac, that according to testimony taken before a magistrate a fall occurred february nineteenth eighteen thirty near feridpoor india of many fishes of various sizes some whole and fresh and others mutilated and putrefying

3240-131231-0066.flac, some of the fish were fresh but others were rotten and without heads among the number which i got five were fresh and the rest stinking and headless they remind us of his grace's observation of some pages back

3240-131231-0069.flac, again the small area about sixty by thirty yards the fall occurred during a heavy rain that was accompanied by thunder
3240-131231-0070.flac,but by no visible lightning the sea is close to hindon but if you try to think of these fishes having described its trajectory in a whirlwind from the ocean consider this remarkable datum bad
3240-131231-0071.flac, according to witnesses the fall upon this small area occupied ten minutes i cannot think of a clearer indication of a direct fall from a stationary source and
3240-131231-0072.flac,the fish were all dead and indeed stiff and hard when picked up immediately after the occurrence by all of which i mean that we have only begun to pile up our data of things that fall from a stationary source overhead
3240-131231-0073.flac, we'll have to take up the subject from many many approaches before our acceptance which seems quite as rigorously arrived at as ever has been a belief can't emerge from the accursed i don't know how much the horse and the barn will help us to emerge
3240-131231-0074.flac,but if ever anything did go up from this earth's surface and stay up those damned things may have monthly weather review may eighteen seventy eight in a tornado in wisconsin may twenty third eighteen seventy eight
3240-131231-0075.flac,a barn and a horse were carried completely away and neither horse nor barn nor any portion of either have since been found after that which would be a little strong were it not for a steady improvement in our digestions that i note as we go along
3240-131231-0076.flac,there is little of the bizarre or the unassimilable in the turtle that hovered six months or so over a small town in mississippi monthly weather review may eighteen ninety four
3240-131231-0077.flac,fell a small piece of alabaster that at bovina eight miles from vicksburgh fell a go for turtle they fell in a hailstorm this item was widely copied at the time for instance nature
3240-131231-0078.flac,as too discussion not a word or science and its continuity with presbyterianism data like this are damned at birth the weather review does sprinkle or baptize or attempt to save this infant
3240-131231-0079.flac,but in all the meteorological literature that i have gone through after that date not a word except mention once or twice the editor of the review says
3240-131231-0080.flac, an examination of the weather map shows that these hailstorms occur on the south side of a region of cold northerly winds and were but a small part of a series of similar storms
3240-131231-0081.flac, of all incredibilities that we have to choose from i give first place to a notion of a whirlwind pouncing upon a region
3240-131231-0082.flac, this time the other mechanical thing there in the first place cannot rise in response to its stimulus it is resisted in that these objects were coated with ice month of may in a southern state if a whirlwind at all
3240-131231-0083.flac,there must have been very limited selection there is no record of the fall of other objects but there is no attempt in the review to specify a whirlwind these strangely associated things were remarkably separated they fell eight miles apart
3240-131231-0084.flac,then as if there were real reasoning they must have been high to fall with such divergence or one of them must have been carried partly horizontally eight miles farther than the other but either supposition argues for power more than that of a local whirl or gust
3240-131231-0085.flac,or argues for a great specific disturbance of which there is no record for the month of may eighteen ninety four
3240-131232-0000.flac,then i think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of mississippi weeks or months before may eleventh eighteen ninety four no i don't look for it and inevitably find it or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up indefinitely
3240-131232-0001.flac,but may after a while be shaken down by storms
3240-131232-0002.flac, so then that the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different origins from different worlds perhaps have entered a region of suspension over this earth wafting near each other long duration
3240-131232-0003.flac, final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance with hail or that hailstones too when large are phenomena of suspension of long duration that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could become so great only in falling from the clouds
3240-131232-0004.flac,long duration other indications of long duration i think of a region somewhere above this earth's surface in which gravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the distance
3240-131232-0005.flac, quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from a magnet theoretically the attraction of a magnet should decrease with the square of the distance but the falling off is found to be almost abrupt at a short distance
3240-131232-0006.flac, horses and barns and elephants and flies and dodoes moas and pterodactyls leaves from modern trees and leaves of the carboniferous era all however tending to disintegrate into homogeneous looking muds or dusts
3240-131232-0007.flac, red or black or yellow treasure trolls for the paleontologists and for the archaeologists accumulations of centuries cyclones of egypt greece and assyria fishes dried in hard there a short time others there long enough to putrify
3240-131232-0008.flac, but the omnipresence of heterogeneity or living fishes also ponds of fresh water oceans of salt water as to the law of gravitation i prefer to take one simple stand
3240-131232-0009.flac,orthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces gravitation is one of these forces all other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness irrespective of distance as well as of attraction
3240-131232-0010.flac,but newtonian gravitation admits attraction only then newtonian gravitation can be only one third acceptable even to the orthodox or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of forces or still simpler here are the data
3240-131232-0011.flac,though it harmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary source and of course with other data too is inadequate to account for two peculiarities of the falls of frogs that never has a fall of tadpoles been reported
3240-131232-0012.flac,that never has a fall of full grown frogs been reported always frogs a few months old it sounds positive but if there be such reports they are somewhere out of my range of reading but tadpoles would be more likely to fall from the sky than would frogs
3240-131232-0013.flac, a little or big if such falls be attributed to whirlwinds and more likely to fall from the super sargasso sea if though very tentatively and provisionally we accept the super sargasso sea
3240-131232-0014.flac,before we take up an especial expression upon the fall of immature and larval forms of life to this earth and the necessity then of conceiving of some factor besides mere stationariness or suspension or stagnation
3240-131232-0015.flac, there are other data that are similar to data of falls of fishes science gossip
3240-131232-0016.flac,that small snails of a land species had fallen near redruth cornwall july eighth eighteen eighty six during a heavy thunderstorm roads and fields strewn with them so that they were gathered up by the hatful
3240-131232-0017.flac, none seemed to fall by the writer of this account snails had to be quite different to any previously known in this district
3240-131232-0018.flac, of great and deserved repute i thought i should for once like to trace the origin of one of these fabulous tails our own acceptance as i justice cannot be in an intermediate existence
3240-131232-0019.flac, in which there can be approximation only to justice or to injustice that to be fair is to have no opinion at all that to be honest is to be uninterested that to investigate is to admit prejudice that nobody has ever really investigated anything
3240-131232-0020.flac,but has always sought positively to prove or to disprove something that was conceived of or suspected in advance as i suspected says this correspondent i found that the snails were of a familiar land species that they had been upon the ground
3240-131232-0021.flac, in the first place he found that the snails had appeared after the rain that astonished rustics had jumped to the conclusion that they had fallen he met one person who said that he had seen the snails fall this was his error says the investigator
3240-131232-0022.flac, in such quantities that they were shoveled up it is said that the snails may be considered as a local species
3240-131232-0023.flac,and that in his opinion they had been upon the ground in the first place but that there had been some unusual condition aloft comes out in his observation upon the curious azure blue appearance of the sun at the time
3240-131232-0024.flac, that according to das wetter december eighteen ninety two upon august ninth eighteen ninety two a yellow cloud appeared over paderborn germany from this cloud fell a torrential rain in which were hundreds of mussels
3240-131232-0025.flac,there is no mention of whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place nor of a whirlwind lizards
3240-131232-0026.flac,that during a heavy shower july third eighteen sixty he heard a peculiar sound at his feet and looking down saw a snake lying as if stunned by a fall it then came to life gray snake about a foot long
3240-131232-0027.flac, these data have any meaning or lack of meaning or degree of damnation you please but in the matter of the fall that occurred at memphis tennessee occur some strong significances
3240-131232-0028.flac,our quasi reasoning upon this subject applies to all segregations so far considered monthly weather review january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven that
3240-131232-0029.flac,rather strictly localized or in a space of two blocks and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found they were crawling on sidewalks in yards and in streets and in masses
3240-131232-0030.flac,but none were found on roofs or any other elevation above ground and none were seen to fall if you prefer to believe that the snakes had always been there or had been upon the ground in the first place and that it was only that something occurred to call special attention to them
3240-131232-0031.flac, in the streets of memphis january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven why that's sensible that's the common sense that has been against us from the first it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not
3240-131232-0032.flac, and had not been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses in the first place if we try to accept that these snakes had been raised from some other part of this earth's surface in a whirlwind if we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them
3240-131232-0033.flac,stones fence rails limbs of trees say that the snakes occupied the next gradation and would be the next to fall
3240-131232-0034.flac,again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hybrinating snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes
3240-131232-0035.flac,i don't know how many to a den hundreds maybe but according to the account of this occurrence in the new york times there were thousands of them alive from one foot to eighteen inches in length
3240-131232-0036.flac,records the fall and says that there were thousands of them the usual whirlwind explanation is given but in what locality snakes exist in such abundance is yet a mystery this matter of enormousness of numbers
3240-131232-0037.flac, suggests to me something of a migratory nature but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january if ever as to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough

3699-175950-0002.flac,by the way if you would know the strange way of getting a kin amongst so flat nosed a people you must read the book find it out yourself you never can
3699-175950-0003.flac,you must mean your uncle's replied my great grandmother my great grandfather was convinced he untwisted the paper and signed the article
3699-175950-0004.flac,so that my father had the jointure to pay a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly on michaelmas and lady day during all that time no man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father
3699-175950-0005.flac, as soon as ever he entered upon the odd fifty he generally gave aloud him
3699-175950-0006.flac, inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his wig looked at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples
3699-175950-0007.flac, and feel pity for the force of education and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors for three generations at least this tenet in favour of long noses
3699-175950-0008.flac,so that the whimsicality of my father's brain was far from having the whole honour of this as it had of almost all his other strange notions for in a great measure he might be said to have suck'd this in with his mother's milk
3699-175950-0009.flac,that he did not conceive how the greatest family in england could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses and for the contrary reason he would generally add
3699-175950-0010.flac, that it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life where the same number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct line
3699-175950-0011.flac, i mean the external organ of smelling or that part of man which stands prominent in his face and which painters say in good jolly noses and well proportioned faces should comprehend a full third that is measured downwards from the setting on of the hair
3699-175950-0012.flac,did he read such books and observe such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him change sides now my father as i told you last year detested all this he pick'd up an opinion sir
3699-175950-0013.flac, as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple it becomes his own and if he is a man of spirit he would lose his life rather than give it up

3699-175950-0018.flac,they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting as in the case above so that they might well and truly be said to be of his own goods and chattels accordingly he held fast by em both by teeth and claws
3699-175950-0019.flac, would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on and in a word would intrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breast works as my uncle toby would a citadel
3699-175950-0020.flac,by the trotting of my lean horse the thing is incredible and i am quite lost in my understanding when i am considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon worse subjects
3699-175950-0021.flac,what was to be had however he set the greater store by and though my father would oft times sport with my uncle toby's library which by the by was ridiculous enough

3699-19401-0000.flac,my father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations thrusting and ripping and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn
3699-19401-0001.flac,for that the tailor in ripping them up in order to turn them had found that they had been turned before then turn them again brother said my father rapidly for there will be many a turning of them yet before all's done in the affair
3699-19401-0002.flac,they are as rotten as dirt said the corporal then by all means said my father bespeak a new pair brother for though i know continued my father turning himself to the company
3699-19401-0003.flac,that widow wadman has been deeply in love with my brother toby for many years and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion yet now that she has caught him her fever will be passed its height

3699-19401-0005.flac,the hypothesis like the rest of my father's was plausible enough and my uncle toby had but a single word to object to it in which trim stood ready to second him but my father had not drawn his conclusion
3699-19401-0006.flac,for this reason continued my father stating the case over again notwithstanding all the world knows that missus wadman affects my brother toby and my brother toby contrariwise affects missus wadman

3699-19401-0009.flac, now trim's montero cap as i once told you was his constant wager and having furbish'd it up that very night in order to go upon the attack it made the odds look more considerable
3699-19401-0010.flac,i would lay an please your honour my montero cap to a shilling was it proper continued trim making a bow to offer a wager before your honours there is nothing improper in it said my father
3699-19401-0011.flac,that widow wadman an please your worship cannot hold it out ten days and whence cried slop jeeringly hast thou all this knowledge of woman friend
3699-19401-0012.flac,by falling in love with a popish clergy woman said trim twas a beguine said my uncle toby doctor slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction
3699-19401-0013.flac,and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter skelter upon the whole order of nuns and beguines a set of silly fusty baggages slop could not stand it and my uncle toby having some measures to take about his breeches
3699-19401-0014.flac,and perhaps it is as well for thee though not so well for me that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head and that i am able to write it to thee had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots
3699-19401-0015.flac, missus shandy being now close beside me preparing for bed i have thrown together without order and just as they have come into my mind such hints and documents as i deem may be of use to thee
3699-19401-0016.flac,though i perceive from a glow in my cheek that i blush as i begin to speak to thee upon the subject as well knowing notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy how few of its offices thou neglectest
3699-19401-0017.flac,yet i would remind thee of one during the continuance of thy courtship in a particular manner which i would not have omitted and that is never to go forth upon the enterprize whether it be in the morning or the afternoon
3699-19401-0018.flac,without first recommending thyself to the protection of almighty god that he may defend thee from the evil one shave the whole top of thy crown clean
3699-19401-0019.flac,once at least every four or five days but oftner if convenient lest in taking off thy wig before her thro absence of mind she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by time how much by trim
3699-19401-0020.flac,whatever thou hast to say be it more or less forget not to utter it in a low soft tone of voice silence and whatever approaches it weathes dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain
3699-19401-0021.flac,for this cause if thou canst help it never throw down the tongs into poker avoid all kinds of pleasantry and faseciousness in thy discourse with her
3699-19401-0022.flac,they are all books which excite laughter and thou knowest dear toby that there is no passion so serious as lust stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou enterest her parlour

3699-19401-0024.flac, whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions my uncle toby and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack as the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside at least for the present
3699-19401-0025.flac,there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning so accordingly it was resolv'd upon for eleven o'clock
3699-19401-0026.flac,but the account of this is worth more than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth alluding to the first edition volume of such a work as this
3699-19402-0000.flac, could have vented such an insinuation he was however frank and generous in his nature and at all times open to conviction so that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort
3699-19402-0001.flac,when his conscience smote him my mother was then conjectually swinging with her left arm twisted under his right in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his

3699-19402-0004.flac,conscience redoubled her blow he turn'd his face suddenly the other way and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards by a cross movement of her right leg

3699-19402-0006.flac,my mother madam was so at no time either by nature by institution or example a temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of the year
3699-19402-0007.flac,which having little or no meaning in them nature is oft times obliged to find one and as for my father's example twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto
3699-19402-0008.flac, that was the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head nature had done her part to have spared him this trouble and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it
3699-19402-0009.flac,and here am i sitting this twelfth day of august seventeen sixty six in a purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers without either wig or cap on a most tragicomical completion of his prediction
3699-19402-0010.flac,for certainly key holes were made for other purposes and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a key hole to be what it was
3699-19402-0011.flac,it became a violation of nature and was so far you see criminal it is for this reason an please your reverences that key holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes
3699-19402-0012.flac,though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle toby's great ramallie wig into pipes yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk
3699-19402-0013.flac,twould have cost her ladyship a smile it curl'd every where but where the corporal would have it and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it honour he could as soon have raised the dead
3699-19402-0014.flac,such it was or rather such would it have seem'd upon any other brow but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle toby's assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself
3699-19402-0015.flac,and nature had moreover wrote gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance that even his tarnish'd gold laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him
3699-19402-0016.flac,in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made by a total inactivity in my uncle toby's life for he seldom went further than the bowling green
3699-19402-0017.flac,and to shorten all description they shone so bright against the sun that morning and had so metallic and dirty in air with them that had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armour nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination
3699-19402-0018.flac,and with his hair tuck'd up under his montero cap which he had furbish'd up for the occasion
3699-19402-0019.flac,a whiff of military pride had puff'd out his shirt at the wrist and upon that in a black leather thong clipp'd into a tassel beyond the knot hung the corporal's stick my uncle toby carried his cane
3699-19402-0020.flac, like a pike it looks well at least quoth my father to himself
3699-19402-0021.flac,my uncle toby turned his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal and the corporal as oft as he did it gave a slight flourish with his stick
3699-19402-0022.flac,but not vapouringly and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement bid his honour never fear now my uncle toby did fear and grievously too
3699-19402-0023.flac, infinite was his pity nor would the most courteous knight of romance have gone further at least upon one leg to have wiped away a tear from a woman's eye
3699-19402-0024.flac,and yet excepting once that he was beguiled into it by missus wadman he had never looked stedfastly into one and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart
3699-19402-0025.flac,she cannot quoth my uncle toby halting when they had march'd up to within twenty paces of missus wadman's door she cannot corporal take it amiss
3699-19402-0026.flac, your honour replied the corporal knows of tom's misfortunes but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this
3699-19402-0027.flac,that if tom had not married the widow or had it pleased god after their marriage that they had but put pork into their sausages the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed and dragg'd to the inquisition
3699-19402-0028.flac,when once a poor creature is in he is in and please your honour forever tis very true said my uncle toby looking gravely at missus wadman's house as he spoke nothing
3699-19402-0029.flac, said my uncle toby musing whilst a man is free cried the corporal giving a flourish with his stick thus
3699-19402-0030.flac,a thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have said more for celibacy my uncle toby look'd earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling green
3699-47246-0016.flac, not indeed any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom but much external polish and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind
3699-47246-0020.flac, and give him at least a sort of cousin ship to the quarter sessions all this which was the simple truth would have seemed extremely flat to the gossip's of milby who had made up their minds to something much more exciting
4018-103416-0000.flac, the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one it was marked by an almost feverish gayety as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self interest
4018-103416-0001.flac, mills and factories took on new life labor were scarce and high it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure people played that they might not think washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved
4018-103416-0002.flac, kept its secret well and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce war was to most of the nation a great dramatic spectacle presented to them at breakfast and in the afternoon editions
4018-103416-0003.flac, for the red cross and kindred activities but although the war was in the nation's mind it was not yet in its soul life went on much as before an abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency
4018-103416-0004.flac,the great six months battle of the somme with its million casualties was resulting favorably on the east the russians had made some gains there were wagers that the germans would be done in the spring
4018-103416-0005.flac, but again washing to new that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful that the amount of loss territory were gained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the british islands was acute
4018-103416-0006.flac, that the submarine sinkings were colossal our peace was at a fearful cost and on the edge of this volcano america played when graham spencer left the mill that used the afternoon it was to visit marion hayden
4018-103416-0007.flac,he was rather bored now at the prospect he would have preferred going to the club to play billiards which was his custom of a late afternoon he drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed marion's invitation to get there before the crowd
4018-103416-0008.flac, three cars before the house showed that she already had callers and indeed when the parlor made opened the door a burst of laughter greeted him the Hayden house was a general rendezvous there were usually by seven o'clock whiskey and soda glasses
4018-103416-0009.flac,and tea cups on most of the furniture and half smoked cigarets on everything that would hold them including the piano marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing room door
4018-103416-0010.flac,i kept the library as long as i could we can sit on the stairs if you like which they proceeded to do quite amiably from various open doors came subdued voices the air was pungent with tobacco smoke
4018-103416-0011.flac, permeated with a faint scent of late afternoon high balls tomie marion called when she had settled herself yes from a distance did you leave your cigarette on the piano
4018-103416-0012.flac,no toots dear but i can easily mother marion explained
4018-103416-0013.flac, well do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night not exactly but i meant them he looked up at her admiringly he was only a year from college and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debutantes
4018-103416-0014.flac, since the night before he had been wrangling under a sense of youth was i pretty awful last night he asked you were very interesting and i imagine rather indescried
4018-103416-0015.flac, about the new war contracts oh business
4018-103416-0016.flac, and i like big figures poor people always do has it really gone through i mean those things do slip up sometimes don't they it's gone through all right signed sealed and delivered
4018-103416-0017.flac, encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder
4018-103416-0018.flac,her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marion hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had
4018-103416-0019.flac,was the beauty of youth only and that that was going late hours golf perhaps a little more champagne and was necessary at dinners and the morning's found her almost plain and too
4018-103416-0020.flac,she had the far vision of the calculating mind she knew that if the country entered the war every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer at twenty five she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers
4018-103416-0021.flac, were now sending flowers to the debutantes and cutting in on the younger men at balls her house was still a rendezvous but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room the library and the music room that afternoon
4018-103416-0022.flac,they met there smoked her cigarets made love in a corner occasionally became engaged but she was of the game no longer in it men still came to see her a growing percentage of them married
4018-103416-0023.flac,they brought or sent her tribute flowers candy and cigarets
4018-103416-0024.flac, but more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd like natalie spencer's stupid party the night before so she watched graham and listened he was a nice boy and a handsome one
4018-103416-0025.flac,also he promised to be sole heir to a great business if the war only lasted long enough imagine your knowing all those things she said admiringly you're a partner aren't you he flushed slightly
4018-103416-0026.flac,not yet but of course i shall be when you really get going i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made i'm the most ignorant person you ever knew i'll be awfully glad to
4018-103416-0027.flac, well go in and stir up some of the lovers she suggested and if tomy hail hasn't burned up the piano we can dance a bit you dance to vinynely you know it was after seven when he reached home he felt every inch a man
4018-103416-0028.flac,he held himself very straight as he entered the house and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler had given place to a dignified nod natalie was in her dressing room at his knock she told the maid to admit him
4018-103416-0029.flac,his new found maturity seemed to be slipping from him somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy honestly mother i'd rather go to father and tell him about it
4018-103416-0030.flac,she ignored his protest as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters i'm accustomed to it was her sole reply but her resigned voice brought her as it always had
4018-103416-0031.flac,the ready tribute of the boy's sympathy sit down graham i want to talk to you he sat down still uneasily fingering the roll of bills
4018-103416-0032.flac,when at a sound in Clayton's room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket have you noticed a change in your father since he came back her tone was so ominous that he started he's not sick is he
4018-103416-0033.flac,she was holding out both hands to him piteously you wouldn't go would you i might have to go he evaded you wouldn't graham you're all i have all i have left to live for you wouldn't need to go it's ridiculous you're needed here
4018-103416-0034.flac, your father needs you he needs me the hell of a lot the boy muttered but he went over and stooping down kissed her trembling face don't worry about me he said lightly i don't think we've got spine enough to get into the mix up anyhow
4018-103416-0035.flac, and if we have you won't go promise me you won't go when he hesitated she resorted to her old methods with both clayton and the boy she was doing all she could to make them happy she made no demands none
4018-103416-0036.flac, but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received graham listened
4018-103416-0037.flac,she was a really pathetic figure crouched in her low chair and shaken with terror she must have rather a bad time there were so many things she dared not take to his father she brought them to him instead her small grievances
4018-103416-0038.flac,and she had helped him out of a hole just now all right i promise he said at last but you were worrying yourself for nothing mother she was quite content then cheered at once consulted the jeweled watch on her dressing table
4018-107312-0000.flac,the chief street of mowbray called castle street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its neighbourhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence
4018-107312-0001.flac,the dimensions of castle street were not unworthy of the metropolis it traversed a great portion of the town and was proportionately wide its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity
4018-107312-0002.flac,while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses not as beautiful as the palaces of venice but in their way not less remarkable magnificent shops and here and there though rarely some ancient factory built among the fields
4018-107312-0003.flac, in the infancy of mowbray by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labors
4018-107312-0004.flac, would be the future eye sore of a flourishing posterity pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile gerard and stephen turned down a street which intersected it
4018-107312-0005.flac, and so on through a variety of ways and winding lanes till they arrived at an open portion of the town a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack looking buildings
4018-107312-0006.flac, that rose in all directions clustering yet isolated announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of mowbray crossing this open ground they gained a suburb but one of a very different description
4018-107312-0007.flac,to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with sybil this one was populous noisy and lighted it was saturday night the streets were thronged an infinite population kept swarming to and fro
4018-107312-0008.flac, by narrow archways like the entrance of hives so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission while ascending to these same streets from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps
4018-107312-0009.flac,the subterraneous nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest the bright and lively shops were crowded and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls
4018-107312-0010.flac,still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase and so it is widow said a little pale man wistfully come come it's getting late and your wife's ill you're a good soul
4018-107312-0011.flac,or the mayor of mowbray at least wages said the man i wish you may get em those villains shuffle and screw have sarved me with another bate ticket and a pretty figure too
4018-107312-0012.flac, oh the carnal monsters exclaimed the widow if there they don't come the bloody minded naves and for the small cups too small cups be hanged am i the man to send up a bad bottom cup widow carey
4018-107312-0013.flac,you sent up for snakes i have no you man and boy john hill these twenty summers i never heard a word against you till you got into shuffle and screw's mill oh they are a bad yarn john
4018-107312-0014.flac,they do us all widow they pretends to give the same wages as the rest and works it out in fines you can't come and you can't go but there's a fine you're never paid wages but there's a bate ticket
4018-107312-0015.flac,i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines so la life but those shuffled and screw are rotten sneaky bad yarns said mistress carey
4018-107312-0016.flac, wheel indeed you look very like a soul as feeds on wheel continued missus carey in an under tone as her declining customer moved away well it gets late said the widow
4018-107312-0017.flac,and if you like to take this scraggand home to your wife neighbor hill we can talk of the rest next saturday and what you will sir said the widow with a stern expression to her youth who now stopped at her stall
4018-107312-0018.flac,he was about sixteen with a lithe figure and a handsome faded impudent face his long loose white trousers gave him height he had no waistcoat but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck
4018-107312-0019.flac, a high crowned dark brown hat which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye well you need not be so fierce mother carey said the youth with an affected air of deprecation
4018-107312-0020.flac,don't mother me said the jolly widow with a kindling eye go to your own mother who is dying in a back cellar without a winder while you've got lodgings in a two pair dying she's only drunk said the youth
4018-107312-0021.flac,what makes her drink but toil working from five o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night and for the like of such as you that's a good one said the youth i should like to know what my mother ever did for me but give me treacle and laudanum when i was a babby
4018-107312-0022.flac,to stop my tongue and fill my stomach by the token of which as my gal says she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all mowbray and here the youth drew himself up and thrust his hands in the side pockets of his pea jacket well
4018-107312-0023.flac, i never said missus carey no i never heard a thing like that what not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for veal cutlets mother hold your tongue mister imperence said the widow it's very well known you're no christian and who'll believe what you say
4018-107312-0024.flac,it's very well known that i'm a man what pays his way said the boy and don't keep a huckster's stall to sell carrion by star light but live in a two pair if you please and has a wife and family or as good
4018-107312-0025.flac, said a good humoured voice it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped they were gaily dressed a light handkerchief tied under the chin their hair scrupulously arranged they wore coral neck laces and earrings of gold
4018-107312-0026.flac,she added in a lower tone well i have left mister trafford's mill said the girl that's a bad job said missus carey for those traffords are kind to their people
4018-107312-0027.flac,so it is said the girl but then it was so dull i can't stand a country life missus carey i must have company well i do love a bit of gossip myself said missus carey with great frankness
4018-107312-0028.flac,and then i'm no scholar said the girl and never could take to learning and those traffords had so many schools learning is better than house and land said missus carey though i'm no scholar myself but then in my time things was different
4018-107312-0029.flac,but young persons yes and mick i don't think i could get through the day if it were no for our institute and what's that asked missus carey with a sneer the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure said mick
4018-107312-0030.flac, we have got fifty members and take in three london papers one northern star and two moral worlds and where are you now child continued the widow to the girl
4018-107312-0031.flac,if you will take a dish of tea with us to morrow we expect some friends i take it kindly said missus carey and so you keep house together all the children keep house in these days times is changed indeed
4018-107312-0032.flac, and we shall be happy to see you mick and julia if you are not engaged continued the girl and she looked at her friend a pretty demure girl who immediately said but in a somewhat faultering tone oh that we shall
4018-107312-0033.flac, well we had no thoughts but i said to harriet as it is a fine night let us walk about as long as we can and then to morrow we will lie in bed till afternoon
4018-107312-0034.flac,but at this season of the year i must have life the moment i came out i bathed in the river and then went home and dressed he added in a satisfied tone and now i am going to the temple i'll tell you what julia has been pricked to day with a shuttle
4018-107312-0035.flac, i'll stand treat and take you and your friend to the temple well that's delight said caroline there's no one does the handsome thing like you dandy mick and i always say so oh i love the temple tis so genteel
4018-107312-0036.flac, i was speaking of it to harriet last night
4018-107312-0037.flac, i proposed to go with her but two girls alone you understand me one does not like to be seen in these places as if one kept no company very true said mick and now we'll be off good night widow
4018-107338-0000.flac, morley paused as he recognised egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
4018-107338-0001.flac,perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things
4018-107338-0002.flac,and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
4018-107338-0003.flac,and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears
4018-107338-0004.flac, and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies
4018-107338-0005.flac,that appearance was pre possessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
4018-107338-0006.flac, detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced
4018-107338-0007.flac,is the privilege of the people of whom i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour their labour said sybil
4018-107338-0008.flac,is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held who include the force and efficacy of prayer
4018-107338-0009.flac,then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing
4018-107338-0010.flac,he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
4018-107338-0011.flac,this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
4018-107338-0012.flac,he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me
4018-107338-0013.flac, he would propose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here
4018-107338-0014.flac,you did well good steve and as you always do said sybil with amusing elapsedracted air no one has so much forthought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
4018-107338-0015.flac, hers were kind and calm and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
4018-107338-0016.flac, the mystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sybil there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here today he met and addressed me and i only recognised an acquaintance
4018-107338-0017.flac, had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
4018-107338-0018.flac, you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil
4018-107338-0019.flac,he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
4018-107338-0020.flac,and yet if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
4018-107338-0021.flac, the factions become united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
4018-107338-0022.flac, you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well
4018-107338-0023.flac, but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet
4018-107338-0024.flac, moorly shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is an active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
4018-107338-0025.flac, lawfully meeting an open day and their delegates from the whole realm de clearing their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavored to degrade them
4018-107338-0026.flac, there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephen's itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
4018-107338-0027.flac, my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believed that we had on our side god and truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley
4018-107338-0028.flac, the factions and the failures of our oppressors at this moment gerard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of sybil and morley
4018-107338-0029.flac,saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of justice that mowbray castle is as much yours
4018-107338-0030.flac,as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land but can we prove it we never had the legal evidence you are in error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda
4018-107338-0031.flac, very useful no doubt i hope i shall find them but of no validity if money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter
4018-107338-0032.flac,i'll not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely fit for business
412-126975-0000.flac,the flying stars the most beautiful crime i ever committed flambeau would say in his highly moral old age
412-126975-0001.flac, was also by a singular coincidence my last it was committed at christmas as an artist
412-126975-0002.flac, i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe as if for a statuary group
412-126975-0003.flac,thus squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak while jews on the other hand should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless
412-126975-0004.flac, among the lights and screens of the cafe riche thus in england if i wished to relieve a dean of his riches which is not so easy as you might suppose i wished to frame him
412-126975-0005.flac,if i make myself clear in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral town similarly in france when i had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant
412-126975-0006.flac,which is almost impossible it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a gray line of clipped poplars and though solemn planes of gall over which broods the mighty spirit of milley
412-126975-0007.flac, well my last crime was a christmas crime a cheery cosy english middle class crime a crime of charles dickens
412-126975-0008.flac, i did it in a good old middle class house near putney a house with a crescent of carriage drive a house with a stable by the side of it a house with the name on the two outer gates
412-126975-0009.flac, a house with a monkey tree enough you know the species i really think my imitation of dickens's style was dexterous and literary it seems almost a pity
412-126975-0010.flac, i repented the same evening flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside and even from the inside it was odd seen from the outside
412-126975-0011.flac,it was perfectly incomprehensible and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it from this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable
412-126975-0012.flac, opened on the garden with the monkey tree and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes
412-126975-0013.flac, but her figure was beyond conjecture for she was so wrapped up in brown furs that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur but for the attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear
412-126975-0014.flac,the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds filling them as it were with the ghosts of the dead roses
412-126975-0015.flac, on one side of the house stood the stable on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind the young lady having scattered bread for the birds
412-126975-0016.flac,for the fourth or fifth time that day because the dog ate it passed unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation of evergreens behind
412-126975-0017.flac,here she gave an exclamation of wonder real or ritual and looking up at the high garden wall above her beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure
412-126975-0018.flac, oh don't jump mister crook she called out in some alarm it's much too high the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse
412-126975-0019.flac,was a tall angular young man with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush intelligent and even distinguished lineaments but a sallow and almost alien complexion
412-126975-0020.flac, this showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie the only part of his costume of which he seemed to take any care perhaps it was a symbol
412-126975-0021.flac,he took no notice of the girl's alarmed adjuration but leaped like a grasshopper to the ground beside her where he might very well have broken his legs i think i was meant to be a burglary
412-126975-0022.flac,he said placidly and i have no doubt i should have been if i hadn't happened to be born in that nice house next door i can't see any harm in it anyhow
412-126975-0023.flac, how can you say such things she remonstrated well said the young man if you're born on the wrong side of the wall i can't see that it's wrong to climb over it
412-126975-0024.flac, i never know what you will say or do next she said i don't often know myself replied mister crook but then i am on the right side of the wall now
412-126975-0025.flac,and which is the right side of the wall asked the young lady smiling whichever side you are on said the young man named crook
412-126975-0026.flac,as they went together through the laurels towards the front garden a motor horn sounded thrice coming nearer and nearer and a car of splendid speed great elegance
412-126975-0027.flac, and stood throbbing hullo hullo said the young man with the red tie here's somebody born on the right side anyhow i didn't know miss adams that your santa claus was so modern as this
412-126975-0028.flac, oh that's my godfather sir leopold fischer he always comes on boxing day then after an innocent pause which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm
412-126975-0029.flac, ruby adams added he is very kind john crook generalist had heard of that eminent city magnate and it was not his fault if the city magnate
412-126975-0030.flac, had not heard of him for in certain articles in the clarion or the new age sir leopold had been dealt with austerely but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motor car
412-126975-0031.flac,which was rather a long process a large neat chauffeur in green got out from the front and a small neat manservant in gray got out from the back and between them they deposited sir leopold on the doorstep
412-126975-0032.flac, and began to unpack him like some very carefully protected parcel rugs enough to stock a bazaar furs of all the beasts of the forest and scarves of all the colours of the rainbow
412-126975-0033.flac, were unwrapped one by one till they revealed something resembling the human form the form of a friendly but foreign looking old gentleman with a grey goat like beard and a beaming smile
412-126975-0034.flac,who rubbed his big fur gloves together long before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch had opened in the middle and colonel adams father of the furry young lady
412-126975-0035.flac,had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside he was a tall sunburnt and very silent man who wore a red smoking cap like a fez making him look like one of the english sirdars
412-126975-0036.flac, or pashas in egypt with him was his brother in law lately come from canada a big and rather boisterous young gentleman farmer with a yellow beard by name james blount
412-126975-0037.flac,with him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighbouring roman church for the colonel's late wife had been a catholic and the children as is common in such cases had been trained to follow her
412-126975-0038.flac,everything seemed undistinguished about the priest even down to his name which was brown yet the colonel had always found something companionable about him and frequently asked him to such family gatherings
412-126975-0039.flac, in the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for sir leopold and the removal of his wraps porch and vestibule indeed
412-126975-0040.flac, were unduly large in proportion to the house and formed as it were a big room with the front door at one end and the bottom of the staircase at the other in front of the large hall fire
412-126975-0041.flac,over which hung the colonel's sword the process was completed and the company including the saturnine crook presented to sir leopold fischer that venerable financier however
412-126975-0042.flac,still seemed struggling with portions of his well lined attire and at length produced from a very interior tailcoat pocket a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his christmas present for his goddaughter
412-126975-0043.flac,with an unaffected vain glory that had something disarming about it he held out the case before them all it flew open at a touch and half blinded them
412-126975-0044.flac,it was just as if a crystal fountain had spurted in their eyes in a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all round them
412-126975-0045.flac,fischer stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the colonel the wonder of the whole group
412-126975-0046.flac,i had to be careful of em coming down they're the three great african diamonds called the flying stars because they've been stolen so often all the big criminals are on the track
412-126975-0047.flac,but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them i might have lost them on the road here it was quite possible quite natural i should say
412-126975-0048.flac, growled the man in the red tie i shouldn't blame em if they had taken em when they ask for bread and you don't even give them a stone i think they might take the stone for themselves
412-126975-0049.flac, i won't have you talking like that cried the girl who was in a curious glow you've only talked like that since you became a horrid what's his name you know what i mean
412-126975-0050.flac,a saint said father brown i think said sir leopold with a supercilious smile that ruby means a socialist
412-126975-0051.flac,a radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes remarked crook with some impatience and a conservative does not mean a man who preserves jam neither i assure you
412-126975-0052.flac,does a socialist mean a man who desires a social evening with the chimney sweep a socialist means a man who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney sweeps paid for it but who won't allow you
412-126975-0053.flac,put in the priest in a low voice to own your own suit crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect does one want to own suit he asked one might
412-126975-0054.flac, with speculation in his eye i've heard that gardeners use it and i once made six children happy at christmas when the conjuror didn't come entirely with soot applied externally
412-126975-0055.flac, oh splendid cried ruby oh i wish you'd do it to this company the boisterous canadian mister blount was lifting his loud voice in applause
412-126975-0056.flac, and the astonished financier his in some considerable deprecation when a knock sounded at the double front doors the priest opened them and they showed again the front garden of evergreens monkey tree and all
412-126975-0057.flac,now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset the scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint like a back scene in a play that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the door
412-126975-0058.flac,he was dusty looking and in a frayed coat evidently a common messenger any of you gentlemen mister blount he asked and held forward a letter doubtfully
412-126975-0059.flac, mister blount started and stopped in his shout of assent ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it his face clouded a little and then cleared and he turned to his brother in law and host
412-126975-0060.flac, i'm sick at being such a nuisance colonel he said with the cheery colonial conventions but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here tonight on business in point of fact it's florian
412-126975-0061.flac,that famous french acrobat and comic actor i knew him years ago out west he was a french canadian by birth and he seems to have business for me though i hardly guess what
412-126975-0062.flac,of course of course replied the colonel carelessly my dear chap any friend of yours no doubt he will prove an acquisition
412-126975-0063.flac,he'll black his face if that's what you mean cried blount laughing i don't doubt he'd black everyone else's eyes i don't care i'm not refined
412-126975-0064.flac,i like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat not on mine please said sir leopold fischer with dignity well well observed crook airily
412-126975-0065.flac,don't let's quarrel there are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat dislike of the red tied youth born of his predatory opinions and evident intimacy with the pretty godchild
412-126975-0066.flac, led fischer to say in his most sarcastic magisterial manner no doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat what is it pray
412-126975-0067.flac, letting a top hat sit on you for instance said the socialist now now now now cried the canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence don't let spoil a jolly evening
412-126975-0068.flac, what i say is let's do something for the company to night not blacking faces or sitting on hats if you don't like those but something of the sort why couldn't we have a proper old english pantomime
412-126975-0069.flac, clown columbine and so on i saw one when i left england at twelve years old and it's blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since i came back to the old country only last year
412-126975-0070.flac,and i find the thing's extinct nothing but a lot of snivelling fairy plays i want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages and they give me princesses moralising by moonlight blue birds
412-126975-0071.flac,or something blue beards more at my line and him i like best when he turned into the pantaloon i'm all for making a policeman into sausages said john crook
412-126975-0072.flac,it's a better definition of socialism than some recently given but surely the get up would be too big a business not a scrap cried blount quite carried away
412-126975-0073.flac, a harlequin aides the quickest thing we can do for two reasons first one can gag to any degree and second all the objects are household things
412-126975-0074.flac, tables and towel horses and washing baskets and things like that that's true admitted crook nodding eagerly and walking about but i'm afraid i can't have my policeman's uniform
412-126975-0075.flac, haven't killed a policeman lately blount frowned thoughtfully a space and then smote his thigh yes we can he cried i've got florian's address here
412-126975-0076.flac,and he knows every costumier in london i'll phone him to bring a police dress when he comes and he went bounding away to the telephone oh it's glorious godfather
412-126975-0077.flac, almost dancing i'll be columbine and you shall be pantaloon the millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heathen solemnity i think my dear he said
412-126975-0078.flac,you must get someone else for pantaloon i will be pantaloon if you like said colonel adams taking his cigar out of his mouth and speaking for the first and last time
412-126975-0079.flac, you ought to have a statue cried the canadian as he came back radiant from the telephone there we are all fitted mister crook shall be clown
412-126975-0080.flac,he's a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes i can be harlequin that only wants long legs and jumping about my friend florian phones he's bringing the police costume he's changing on the way
412-126975-0081.flac, we can act it in this very hall the audience sitting on those broad stairs opposite one row above another these front doors can be the back scene either open or shut shut
412-126975-0082.flac,you see an english interior open a moonlit garden it all goes by magic and snatching a chance piece of billiard chalk from his pocket he ran it across the hall floor
412-126975-0083.flac, half way between the front door and the staircase to mark the line of the footlights how even such a banquet of bosh was got ready in the time remained a riddle
412-126975-0084.flac, but they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry that lives when youth is in a house and youth was in that house that night though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from which it flamed
412-126975-0085.flac,as always happens the invention grew wilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had to create the columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt
412-126975-0086.flac, that strangely resembled the large lamp shade in the drawing room the clown and pantaloon made themselves white with flour from the cook and red with rouge from some other domestic who remained
412-126975-0087.flac,like all true christian benefactors anonymous the harlequin already clad in silver paper out of cigar boxes was with difficulty
412-126975-0088.flac,prevented from smashing the old victorian lustre chandeliers that he might cover himself with resplendent crystals in fact he would certainly have done so had not ruby unearthed some old pantomime paste jewels
412-126975-0089.flac,she had worn at a fancy dress party as the queen of diamonds indeed her uncle james blount was getting almost out of hand in his excitement he was like a school boy
412-126975-0090.flac,he put a paper donkeys head unexpectedly on father brown who bore it patiently and even found some private manner of moving his ears he even assayed to put the paper donkeys tail
412-126975-0091.flac,to the coat tails of sir leopold fischer this however was frowned down uncle is too absurd cried ruby to crook round whose shoulders she had seriously placed a string of sausages
412-126975-0092.flac,why is he so wild he is harlequin to your columbine said crook i am only the clown who makes the old jokes i wish you were the harlequin
412-126975-0093.flac,she said and left the string of sausages swinging father brown though he knew every detail done behind the scenes and had even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime baby
412-126975-0094.flac,went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee the spectators were few relations one or two local friends
4137-11701-0000.flac,and now said coronel we'd better decide what to do but i don't mind what we do now said hyacinth happily she may have the throne and father and udo and
4137-11701-0001.flac, that's what makes it so jolly we can do what we like and it doesn't matter if it doesn't come off so just for fun let's think of something to pay her out i feel i don't want to hurt anybody to day all right we won't hurt her we'll humour her
4137-11701-0002.flac,we will be her most humble obedient servants she shall have everything she wants including prince udo smiled hyacinth that's a splendid idea we'll make her have udo
4137-11701-0003.flac,it will annoy your father but one can't please everybody oh i can see myself enjoying this they got up and wandered back along wiggs's path hand in hand i'm almost afraid to leave the forest said hyacinth
4137-11701-0004.flac, in case something happens what should happen i don't know but all our life together has been in the forest and i'm just a little afraid of the world
4137-11701-0005.flac, be very close coronel she whispered and then they walked out together if any of the servants at the palace were surprised to see coronel they did not show it after all that was their business
4137-11701-0006.flac, prince coronel will be staying here said the princess prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both and if they discuss those things in the servants halls of those days
4137-11701-0007.flac,no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth bless her pretty face had found her man at last
4137-11701-0008.flac,but i get no assistance from roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders i say said coronel as they went up the grand staircase i am not a prince you know don't say i have deceived you
4137-11701-0009.flac,you are my prince said hyacinth proudly my dear i am a king among men to day and you are my queen but that's in our own special country of two if you are so particular said hyacinth with a smile
4137-11701-0010.flac,father will make you a proper prince directly he comes back will he that's what i'm wondering you see he doesn't know yet about our little present to the countess but it is quite time we got back to belvane we have left her alone too long
4137-11701-0011.flac,it was more than udo did just now he was with her in her garden telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with the dragon apparently in its dotage to which belvin was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator
4137-11701-0012.flac, and then said udo i jumped quickly to the right and whirling my no wait a bit that was later i jumped quickly to my left yes i remember it now it was my left i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my
4137-11701-0013.flac,he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvane's face she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him why whoever is this she said getting to her feet before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon
4137-11701-0014.flac,the princess and coronel were upon them ah countess i thought we should find you together said hyacinth archly let me present to you my friend the duke coronel
4137-11701-0015.flac,udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bewildered highness on the back aren't you udo and i can think of no one more suitable in every way he bowed again and turned back to the prince well udo you're looking splendid
4137-11701-0016.flac, a different thing countess from when i last saw him
4137-11701-0017.flac, oh what a miracle worker true love is i think one of the things which made belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say
4137-11701-0018.flac, meanwhile udo of course blundered along gaily we aren't exactly princess i mean what are you doing here coronel i didn't know princess that you
4137-11701-0019.flac,the countess and i were just having a little i was just telling her what you said about how did you get here coronel shall we tell him said coronel with a smile at hyacinth hyacinth nodded
4137-11701-0020.flac, i rode said coronel it's a secret he added
4137-11701-0021.flac, explained hyacinth and hearing that there was to be a wedding added coronel belvane made up her mind coronel was evidently a very different man from udo if he stayed in euralia as adviser
4137-11701-0022.flac,more than adviser she guessed to hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt and as for the king it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her
4137-11701-0023.flac,we didn't want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our secret your royal highness she looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on
4137-11701-0024.flac,udo and i here she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronel's took udo's boldly without any more maidenly nonsense udo and i love each other say something udo
4137-11701-0025.flac, prompted coronel er yes said udo very unwillingly and deciding he would explain it all afterwards whatever his feelings for the countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage oh i'm so glad
4137-11701-0026.flac, said hyacinth i felt somehow that it must be coming because you've seen so much of each other lately wiggs and i have often talked about it together what has happened to the child thought belvane she isn't a child at all she's grown up
4137-11701-0027.flac,there's no holding udo once he begins volunteered coronel he's the most desperate lover in araby my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth
4137-11701-0028.flac,you know of course that his majesty comes back to morrow with all his army she did not swoon or utter a cry she did not plead the vapours or the megrims
4137-11701-0029.flac,she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace she said if your royal highness will excuse me
4137-11701-0030.flac, and with a curtsey she was gone coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth i'm enjoying this he seemed to say well she announced i must be going in too there'll be much to see about
4137-11701-0031.flac,and now said the prince tell me what you are doing here coronel put his arm in udo's and walked him up and down the flagged path you're approaching marriage
4137-11701-0032.flac, he said is the talk of araby naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was like my dear udo she's charming i congratulate you don't be a fool coronel i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her
4137-11701-0033.flac,there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now
4137-11701-0034.flac, yes i think you may take our word for it that it's true i haven't the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for
4137-11701-0035.flac, oh very well if you're going to drop all your former friends go on then but when i'm married there will always be a place for understand once and for all said udo angrily that i am not getting married no don't take my arm
4137-11701-0036.flac,we can talk quite well like this i am sorry udo said coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position it wasn't in the least compromising
4137-11701-0037.flac, protested udo indignantly
4137-11701-0038.flac, ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that
4137-11701-0039.flac, once more i am not going to marry her well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story poor innocent girl well let's forget about it and now tell me how do you like euralia
4137-11701-0040.flac, said udo stiffly well perhaps you're right i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way udo who was about to enter the palace turned round with a startled look what do you mean
4137-11701-0041.flac,you never told me your precious countess whom you expect me to marry how very unkind of her a nasty person to annoy he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully
4137-11701-0042.flac,udo evidently hadn't thought of this he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened she couldn't do anything
4137-11701-0043.flac, yes but of course the chance might come again you'd have the thing hanging over you always she's clever you know and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy lovely flowers aren't they what's the name of this one
4137-11701-0044.flac,udo dropped undecidedly into a seat this wanted thinking out the countess what was wrong with her after all and she evidently adored him of course that was not surprising the question was
4137-11701-0045.flac,was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for after all he had been no more gallant than was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions
4137-11701-0046.flac,of course he ought to have left euralia long ago but he had stayed on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that and he had certainly neglected the princess a little
4137-11701-0047.flac,after all again why not marry the countess it was absurd to suppose there was anything in coronel's nonsense but one never knew not that he was marrying her out of fear no certainly not it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part
4137-11701-0048.flac,the poor woman had misunderstood him and she should not be disappointed she seems fond of flowers said coronel you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you now understand clearly coronel
4137-11701-0049.flac,i'm not in the least frightened by the countess my dear udo what a speech for a lover of course you're not after all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again
4137-11701-0050.flac, i must ask you not to refer to it if i marry the countess you'll be a very lucky man put in coronel i happen to know that the king of euralia however she's chosen you it seems
4137-11701-0051.flac, personally i can't make out what she sees in you what is it i should have thought it was quite obvious said udo with dignity well coronel i think perhaps you are right and that it's my duty to marry her
4137-11701-0052.flac, coronel shook him solemnly by the hand i congratulate your royal highness i will announce your decision to the princess she will be much amu much delighted and he turned into the palace
4137-11702-0000.flac, a contemporary poet of the country king merriwig the first rode back from war as many other kings had done before five hundred men behind him were in sight left right left right left right left right left right
4137-11702-0001.flac,so far as is known this was her only work but she built up some reputation on it and belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius to be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men
4137-11702-0002.flac,henry smallnose a bowman of considerable promise had been left behind in the enemy's country the one casualty of war while spying out the land in the early days of the invasion
4137-11702-0003.flac,he had been discovered by the chief armourer of barodia at full length on the wet grass searching for tracks the chief armour a kindly man
4137-11702-0004.flac, henry having caught a glimpse of the chief armourer's daughter had accepted without any false pride and had frequently dropped in to supper thereafter now that the war was over he found that he could not tear himself away
4137-11702-0005.flac,with king merriwig's permission he was settling in barodia and with the chief armors permission he was starting on his new life as a married man as the towers of the castle came in sight merriwig drew a deep breath of happiness home again
4137-11702-0006.flac, wherein his pockets days of honoured leisure were waiting for him he gazed at each remembered land mark of his own beloved country his heart overflowing with thankfulness never again would he leave euralia how good to see highest in the game
4137-11702-0007.flac, poor little hyacinth left all alone but there she had had the countess belvane a woman of great experience to help her belvane should he risk it how much had she thought of him while he was away
4137-11702-0008.flac, hyacinth would be growing up and getting married soon life would be lonely in euralia then unless should he risk it
4137-11702-0009.flac,he must be longing to tell you that oh he'll have a hundred things to tell you first but then when he says and what's been happening here while i've been away nothing much i suppose then you can say
4137-11702-0010.flac,then i shall say nothing much only coronel and such a clever oh i have my ideas said coronel well i'll be out of the way somewhere i think i'll go for a walk in the forest
4137-11702-0011.flac,or shall i stay here in the countess's garden and amuse myself with udo anyhow i'll give you an hour alone together first the cavalcade drew up in front of the castle handkerchiefs fluttered to them from the walls trumpets were blown hounds bade
4137-11702-0012.flac,down the steps came hyacinth all blue and gold and flung herself into her father's arms my dear child said merriwig as he patted her soothingly there there it's your old father come back again there there
4137-11702-0013.flac,he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down my little hyacinth my own little girl oh father i am glad to have you back there there my child
4137-11702-0014.flac,he took a step forward and addressed his troops men of euralia cheers we have returned from a long and arduous conflict cheers to the embraces loud cheers
4137-11702-0015.flac, of our mothers and wives and daughters prolonged cheering as the case may be here here
4137-11702-0016.flac, in honour of our great victory i decree that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout euralia terrific cheering
4137-11702-0017.flac,here he turned and embraced his daughter again and if his eye traveled over her shoulder in the direction of belvane's garden it is a small matter and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame
4137-11702-0018.flac,there was another storm of cheers the battle cry of euralia ho ho merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes hyacinth and merriwig went into the palace
4137-11702-0019.flac, now father said hyacinth later on when merriwig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself you've got to tell me all about it i can hardly believe it's really over yes yes it's all over
4137-11702-0020.flac, said merriwig heartily we shant have any trouble in that direction again i fancy do tell me did the king of barodia apologize he did better than that he abdicated why
4137-11702-0021.flac, well said merriwig remembering just in time i er killed him oh father how rough of you i don't think it hurt him very much my dear
4137-11702-0022.flac,see i have brought these home for you he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper oh how exciting whatever can it be merriwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers
4137-11702-0023.flac,meatly tied up with blue ribbon father he picked out the left one fawns at origo if he had known any Latin of the war and held it up for highest sense infection there you can see the place where henry small knows as arrow bent it
4137-11702-0024.flac,by the way he added henry is marrying and settling down in barodia it is curious he went on how after a war one's thoughts turn to matrimony he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this
4137-11702-0025.flac, but she was still engrossed with the whiskers
4137-11702-0026.flac, i can't plant them in the garden i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia isn't that a little unkind now that the poor man's dead merriwig looked round him to see that there were no eavesdroppers
4137-11702-0027.flac,can you keep a secret he asked mysteriously of course said hyacinth deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told coronel well then listen
4137-11702-0028.flac,he told her of his secret journey to the king of barodious tents he told her of the king of barodious letter
4137-11702-0029.flac,and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent
4137-11702-0030.flac,to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings and by and by the moment came of which coronel had spoken and now said merriwig
4137-11702-0031.flac,nothing much i suppose he waited nervously wondering if hyacinth would realise that all was meant to include more particularly belvane hyacinth drew a stool up to her father's chair and sat down very close to him
4137-11702-0032.flac,father she said stroking his hand where it rested on his knee i have got some news for you nothing about the count nothing serious i hope said merriwig in alarm
4137-11702-0033.flac,it's rather serious but it's rather nice father dear would you mind very much if i got married soon my dear you shall get married as soon as you like let me see there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day
4137-11702-0034.flac, i sent them off on adventures of some kind but dear me yes they ought to have been back by now i suppose you haven't heard anything of them no father said hyacinth with a little smile ah well no doubt they were unsuccessful
4137-11702-0035.flac,no matter dear we can easily find you plenty more suitors indeed the subject has been very near my thoughts lately we'll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighbouring countries there'll be no lack of candidates
4137-11702-0036.flac,let me see there's that seven headed bull he's getting a little old now but he was good enough for the last one we might i don't want a suitor said hyacinus softly i have one merriwig lent forward with eagerness
4137-11702-0037.flac,my dear this is indeed news tell me all about it upon what quest did you send him hyacinth had felt this coming
4137-11702-0038.flac,what is his income a man must prove his worth in some way i haven't sent him away at all yet she said he's only just come he's been very kind to me and i'm sure you'll love him well well we'll arrange something for him
4137-11702-0039.flac,by the way who is he he comes from araby and his name is udo of course why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement my dear it isn't udo i'm afraid father it's coronel
4137-11702-0040.flac, and who might coronel be said the king rather sternly he's he's well he's here he is father she ran up to him impulsively as he came in at the door
4137-11702-0041.flac, oh coronel you're just in time do tell father who you are coronel bowed profoundly to the king before i explain myself your majesty he said
4137-11702-0042.flac, may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the barodians from the little i have gathered outside it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred but of course i am longing to hear the full story from your majesty's own lips
4137-11702-0043.flac,is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of brodia's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it
4137-11702-0044.flac,he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure after his own heart merriwig was in an awkward position he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room leave us my child
4137-11702-0045.flac,he would say these are matters for men to discuss but hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell coronel the truth of the matter afterwards it really looked as if coronel would have to be let into the secret too
4137-11702-0046.flac,there are certain state reasons he said with dignity why that story has been allowed to get about pardon your majesty i have no wish to but as you know so much you may as well know all
4137-11702-0047.flac,it happened like this once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the king's letter to him but your majesty cried coronel
4137-11702-0048.flac,so you like it said merriwig trying to look modest i love it i knew he'd love it put in hyacinth it's just the sort of story that coronel would love
4137-11702-0049.flac, tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war and how you pretended to be a swineherd and how could any father have resisted in a little while hyacinth and coronel were seated eagerly at his feet
4137-11702-0050.flac,and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures well well said the king at the end of it when he had received their tribute of admiration those are just a few of the little adventures that happened in war time he turned to coronel
4137-11702-0051.flac,and so you i understand wish to marry my daughter does that surprise your majesty well no it doesn't and she i understand wishes to marry you yes please father
4137-11702-0052.flac,that said coronel simply is much more surprising merriwig however was not so sure of that he liked the look of coronel he liked his manner
4137-11702-0053.flac,and he saw at once that he knew a good story when he heard one of course he said you'll have to win her anything your majesty sets me to do is as well he added with a disarming smile
4137-11702-0054.flac,that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia there is only one man who could have got those truly an excellent young man well we'll arrange something said merriwig looking pleased
4137-11702-0055.flac,perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor too hyacinth and coronel interchanged a smile alas father she said his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms
4137-11702-0056.flac, wait till he has seen them my dear said merriwig with a chuckle he has seen them father what you invited him here
4137-11702-0057.flac,he came to stay with you and he never his royal highness put in coronel has given his affections to another aha so that's the secret now i wonder if i can guess who she is
4137-11702-0058.flac,what do you say to the princess elvira of tregong i know his father had hopes in that direction hyacinth looked round at coronel as if appealing for his support he took a step towards her
4137-11702-0059.flac,no it's not the princess elvira said hyacinth a little nervously the king laughed good humouredly ah well you must tell me he said
4137-11702-0060.flac, hyacinth put out her hand and coronel pressed it encouragingly his royal highness prince udo she said
4788-294466-0000.flac, mary's nettlesome brown pony was hard to quiet until jerry reached out a strong brown hand and patted its head mary lifted startled blue eyes jerry what do you make of that she asked
4788-294466-0001.flac,we couldn't have imagined that gun shot and surely the horses heard it also jerry's smile was reassuring twas the story that frightened you girls i reckon he said glancing about and up and down the road as he spoke
4788-294466-0002.flac,he must have been dead for years if he was old when jerry's father was a boy of course dora less inclined to be imaginative replied then to the cowboy she said in her practical matter of fact way
4788-294466-0003.flac, hurry along home to your milking jerry and dick don't you bother to come with us now that you're working on the newcomb ranch you ought to be there it's only a few miles up over this sunshiny road to gleeson we aren't the least bit afraid to ride home alone are we
4788-294466-0004.flac,she smiled at her friend mary not wishing to appear foolishly timid said in his courageous voice as she could muster of course we're not afraid good bye boys we'll see you tomorrow
4788-294466-0005.flac,feeling assured that the girls were all right the boys went at a gallop down the road and across the desert valley to the newcomb ranch
4788-294466-0006.flac,they're nice boys aren't they mary said i've always wished i had a brother and i do believe jerry is going to be just like one aloud dora replied i have noticed that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought
4788-294466-0007.flac,oh mary how blind you are dreamily the younger girl was saying that's because we were playmates when we were little so very long ago oh my how ancient we are dora said teasingly
4788-294466-0008.flac,please remember that you are only one year younger than i am and i refuse to be called elderly mary smiled faintly but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist a wonderfully pretty wistful little girl
4788-294466-0009.flac,when she spoke she said it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have my mother met dad in bisbee where he was a mining engineer
4788-294466-0010.flac,and jerry's mother taught a little desert school over near the newcomb ranch she didn't teach long though for that very first vacation she married jerry's cowboy father after that mother and missus newcomb were good friends naturally being brides and neighbors
4788-294466-0011.flac,when jerry and i were little we were playmates i spent days at the ranch sometimes her sweet face was very sad as she ended with until mother died when i was eight then you came east to boarding school and became like a sister to me
4788-294466-0012.flac, far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them
4788-294466-0013.flac,it was very still not a sound was to be heard now and then a rabbit darted past silently how peaceful this hour is on the desert mary began glancing at her friend who was riding so close at her side
4788-294466-0014.flac,noticing the door was deep in thought she asked lightly won't you say it out loud why of course i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loons rock house because he had to do the milking mary replied simply
4788-294466-0015.flac,dora nodded so he said then she hastened to add oh don't think i'm inferring that jerry told an untruth but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glanced up startled dora bellman she said
4788-294466-0016.flac,i don't believe he will tell us about that i acted so like a scare cat all the time we were there he won't ever take us there again and he probably won't tell us the story either then i'll find it out some other way dora declared
4788-294466-0017.flac, i'm crazy about mysteries as you know and if there really is one about that rock house i want to try to solve it she said no more about it just then as they had reached the old ghost town of gleeson
4788-294466-0018.flac,in the long ago days when the town had been teeming with life picturesque looking miners and ranchers had sat there tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns today the chairs were empty an old man shriveled
4788-294466-0019.flac, gray bearded unkempt but with kind gray eyes deep sunken under shaggy brows stood in the open door he smiled out at them in a friendly way then beckoned with a bony finger
4788-294466-0020.flac, i do believe mister harby has a letter for us durah said the old man had shuffled into the dark well of his store a moment later he reappeared with several letters and a newspaper good
4788-294466-0021.flac,dora exclaimed as she rode close to the porch thanks a lot she called brightly up to the old man who was handing the packet down over the sagging wooden rail his friendly toothless smile was directed at the smaller girl
4788-294466-0022.flac,he said mis farley your nurse woman came down to mail some letters a spell back then before mary could reply he continued in his shrill wavering voice
4788-294466-0023.flac, pale feller with specs on is her son ain't he yes mister harvey dick is missus farley's son mary took time in a friendly way to satisfy the old man's curiosity
4788-294466-0024.flac, dick has been going to the arizona state university this winter to be near his mother she's a widow and he's her only son her husband was a doctor and they lived back in boston before he died dew tell the old man wagged his head sympathetically
4788-294466-0025.flac,bustin broncs mary smiled in appreciation of the old man's joke no jerry won't expect dick to do that right at first he's official fence mender just at present dora defended the absent boy mister harvey
4788-294466-0026.flac,you wait until dick has been on the desert long enough to get a coat of tan he may surprise you
4788-294466-0027.flac,some with broken windows and doors others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls the only sign of life was in three small adobes where poor mexican families lived broken windows in two of the houses were stuffed with rags
4788-294466-0028.flac,a bright black eyed mexican boy of about ten ran out to the road as the girls approached come on emanuel mary sang down to him you may put up our horses and earn a dime the small boy's white teeth flashed in a delighted grin
4788-294466-0029.flac,his brown feet raced so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square two storied adobe near the mountains emanuel was there to lead their horses around back mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flower edged walk
4788-294466-0030.flac,its broad porch and adobe pillars here her mother had come as a bride here mary had been born eight happy years they had spent together before her mother died after mary had been taken east to school her father had returned
4788-294466-0031.flac,then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom she asked eagerly may i tell dad an adventure we've had missus farley middle aged kind faced shook her head smiling down at the girl not tonight please won't tomorrow do
4788-91208-0000.flac,it looks big and important and it makes a great noise even people a long way up in the scale of civilization are in the habit of taking these attributes perhaps not as the essential ones of leadership but at all events as those by which a leader may be recognized
4788-91208-0001.flac,the pointsman moves a handle and the foaming giant that would it may be have sped on to his destruction and that of the passive crew who follow in his rear is shunted to another line running in a different direction and to a more desirable goal
4788-91208-0002.flac,the great intellectual pointsman of our age the man who has done more than any other of this generation to give direction to the thought of his contemporaries has passed away and we are left to measure the loss to humanity by the result of his labors
4788-91208-0003.flac, mister mill's achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society he is
4788-91208-0004.flac,the structure raised by adam smith milthas and recardo but raised it at least one story higher his inestimable system of logic was a revolution it hardly needs of course to be said that he owed much to his predecessors
4788-91208-0005.flac,that he borrowed from whewell much of his classification from brown the chief lines of his theory of causation from sir john herschel the main principles of the inductive methods those who think this a disparagement of his work must have very little conception
4788-91208-0006.flac,of the mass of original thought that still remains to mister mill's credit the great critical power that could gather valuable truths from so many discordant sources and the wonderful synthetic ability required to weld these and his own contributions
4788-91208-0007.flac,into one organic whole when mister mill commenced his labors the only logic recognized was the syllogistic
4788-91208-0008.flac, in deducing from general propositions other propositions less general it was even asserted confidently that nothing more was to be expected that an inductive logic was impossible this conception of logical science necessitated
4788-91208-0009.flac,some general propositions to start with and these general propositions being ex
4788-91208-0010.flac,incapable of being proved from other propositions it followed that if they were known to us at all they must be original data of consciousness here was a perfect paradise of question begging the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed
4788-91208-0011.flac,it could of course be fashioned according to the particular conclusion it was called in to prove thus an artificial ignorance as locke calls it was produced which had the effect of sanctifying prejudice by recognizing so called necessities of thought
4788-91208-0012.flac,as the only bases of reasoning it is true that outside of the logic of the school's great advances had been made in the rules of scientific investigation but these rules were not only imperfect in themselves but their connection with the law of causation
4788-91208-0013.flac,was but imperfectly realized and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of mister mill altered all this he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars nor from particulars to generals but from particulars to particulars
4788-91208-0014.flac,but are now dead we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal we might surely without any logical inconsequence have concluded at once from those instances that the duke of wellington is mortal
4788-91208-0015.flac,the mortality of john thomas and others is after all the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the duke of wellington not one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a general proposition
4788-91208-0016.flac,we not only may according to mister mill reason from some particular instances to others but we frequently do so as however the instances which are sufficient to prove one fresh instance
4788-91208-0017.flac,the work of deduction is the interpretation of these formulas and therefore strictly speaking is not inferential at all the real inference was accomplished when the universal proposition was arrived at
4788-91208-0018.flac,all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic and to induction accordingly mister mill devoted his chief attention for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic
4788-91208-0019.flac,and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin it was this taken with his theory of the syllogism which worked the great change both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy
4788-91208-0020.flac,are for the most part devoted to fortifying this position and demolishing the beliefs inconsistent with it as a systematic psychologist mister mill has not done so much as either professor bane or mister herbert spencer
4788-91208-0021.flac,the perfection of his method its application and the uprooting of prejudices which stood in its way this was the task to which mister mill applied himself with an ability and success rarely matched and never surpassed
4788-91208-0022.flac,the biggest lion in the path was the doctrine of so called necessary truth this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth and a standard as he was easily able to show
4788-91208-0023.flac,varying according to the psychological history of the individual such thinkers as doctor whewell and mister herbert spencer had to be met in intellectual combat doctor whewell held not that the inconceivability
4788-91208-0024.flac, of the contradictory of a proposition is a proof of its truth co equal with experience but that its value transcends experience experience experience may tell us what is but it is by the impossibility of conceiving it otherwise
4788-91208-0025.flac,in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy mister mill gives battle to this mode of thought after reviewing in an opening chapter the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge
4788-91208-0026.flac,as mister mill says the name of god is veiled under two extremely abstract phrases infinite and the absolute so profound and friendly a thinker as the late mister groat held this raising of the veil inexpedient but he proved
4788-91208-0027.flac,by a mistake he fell into the necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete he acknowledged the force of mister mill's argument that the infinite must include a farrago of contradictions
4788-91208-0028.flac, in which these contradictory attributes inhere but it was against a corresponding being the infinite that mister mill was arguing it is this that he calls a
4788-91208-0029.flac,and regarded as the reductoad ad absurdism of the transcendental philosophy mister mill's religious tendencies may very well be gathered from a passage in his review of august comped a philosopher with whom he agreed on all points
4788-91208-0030.flac,and prescribed to him a rule of life that person has a religion and though every one naturally prefers his own religion to any other almost admit that if the object of his attachment and of this feeling of duty is the aggregate of our fellow creatures
4788-91208-0031.flac,this religion of the infidel cannot in honesty and conscience be called an intrinsically bad one many indeed may be unable to believe that this object is capable of gathering round it feelings sufficiently strong
4788-91208-0032.flac,and we join with him in contemning as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange an eternity of personal enjoyment
4788-91208-0033.flac,never has the liable of humanity involved in the current theology been more forcibly pointed out with its constant appeal to low motives of personal gain
4788-91208-0034.flac,and all his relations to his fellow creatures the very birds about his dwelling seemed to recognize it it is this noble sentiment which infuses a soul of life into his teachings and the enunciation and acting out of which constitute him
4788-94904-0000.flac,we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement as they range lower and lower in development
4788-94904-0001.flac,that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them though this is not true universally for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity
4788-94904-0002.flac,as upon the degree in which they possess certain special requisites requisites however so closely connected with their degree of general advancement that any variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule
4788-94904-0003.flac,that they should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the functions which it imposes on them the willingness of the people to accept representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler or a foreign nation or nations
4788-94904-0004.flac,who have gained power over the country are disposed to offer it the boon to individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant since if no other objection can be made to their enterprise than that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side
4788-94904-0005.flac,they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at when opinion is really adverse its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself
4788-94904-0006.flac,the contrary case is not indeed unexampled there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be
4788-94904-0007.flac,whether monarchical or popular in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made indifference to it
4788-94904-0008.flac,rather than positive opposition are the obstacles to be expected these however are as fatal and may be as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion it being easier in most cases to change the direction of an active feeling than to create one
4788-94904-0009.flac,in a state previously passive when a people have no sufficient value for and attachment to a representative constitution they have next to no chance of retaining it
4788-94904-0010.flac,and is in direct contact with the public to it principally the hopes and fears of individuals are directed and by it both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye
4788-94904-0011.flac,unless therefore the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive has always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience
4788-94904-0012.flac,and is sure to be well supported in doing so representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of their being endangered if too little valued for this
4788-94904-0013.flac,they seldom obtain a footing at all and if they do are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government or any party leader who can muster force for a coup de main is willing to run some small risk for absolute power
4788-94904-0014.flac, these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution
4788-94904-0015.flac,when nobody or only some small fraction feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion the electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their private interest or the interest of their locality
4788-94904-0016.flac, or of some one with whom they are connected as adherents or dependents the small class who in this state of public feeling gain the command of the representative body for the most part use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune if the executive is weak
4788-94904-0017.flac,the country is distracted by mere struggles for place if strong it makes itself despotic at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives or such of them as are capable of giving trouble by a share of the spoil
4788-94904-0018.flac, and the only fruit produced by national representation is that in addition to those who really govern there is an assembly quartered on the public and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are interested is at all likely to be removed
4788-94904-0019.flac,when however the evil stops here the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which though not an invariable are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation
4788-94904-0020.flac,that the place hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly though they contribute little or nothing directly to good government nor even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive
4788-94904-0021.flac,which exists in that country this benefit however is entirely dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary king if instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler these selfish and sordid factions struggled for the chief place itself
4788-94904-0022.flac,they would certainly as in spanish america keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war a despotism not even legal but of illegal violence would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers
4788-94904-0023.flac,and the name and forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from attaining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized
4788-94904-0024.flac,there are others in which it possibly might exist but in which some other form of government would be preferable these are principally when the people in order to advance in civilization have some lesson to learn some habit not yet acquired
4788-94904-0025.flac,to the acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an impediment the most obvious of these cases is the one already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization that of obedience
4788-94904-0026.flac,a race who have been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body
4788-94904-0027.flac, a representative assembly drawn from among themselves would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination it would refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose on their savage independence any improving restraint
4788-94904-0028.flac, a military leader is the only superior to whom they will submit except occasionally some prophet supposed to be inspired from above or conjuror regarded as possessing miraculous power these may exercise a temporary ascendancy
4788-94904-0029.flac,but as it is merely personal it rarely effects any change in the general habits of the people unless the prophet like mohammed is also a military chief and goes forth the armed apostle of a new religion
4788-94904-0030.flac,or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified by extreme passiveness
4788-94904-0031.flac,and ready submission to tyranny if a people thus prostrated by character and circumstances could obtain representative institutions they would inevitably choose their tyrants as their representatives and the yoke would be made heavier on them by the contrivance which
4788-94904-0032.flac, might be expected to lighten it on the contrary many a people has gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central authority whose position has made it the rival and has ended by making it the master of the local despots
4788-94904-0033.flac,even when the king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief feudatories the great advantage which he derived from being but one has been recognized by french historians to him the eyes of all the locally oppressed were turned
4788-94904-0034.flac,he was the object of hope and reliance throughout the kingdom while each local potentate was only powerful within a more or less confined space at his hands refuge and protection were sought from every part of the country against first one
4788-94904-0035.flac,then another of the immediate oppressors his progress to ascendancy was slow but it resulted from successively taking advantage of opportunities which offered themselves only to him it was therefore sure and in proportion as it was accomplished
4788-94904-0036.flac,it abated in the oppressed portion of the community the habit of submitting to oppression the king's interest lay in encouraging all partial attempts on the part of the serfs to emancipate themselves from their masters and place themselves in immediate subordination to himself
4788-94904-0037.flac,under his protection numerous communities were formed which knew no one above them but the king
4788-94904-0038.flac,and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation in this manner a central power despotic in principle
4788-94904-0039.flac,though generally much restricted in practice was mainly instrumental in carrying the people through a necessary stage of improvement which representative government if real would most likely have prevented them from entering upon
4853-27670-0000.flac,i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvellous
4853-27670-0001.flac, i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone
4853-27670-0002.flac, my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armour so inflexibly hard were they frozen yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins
4853-27670-0003.flac, it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest colour upon the hatchway one thing i quickly noticed that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze
4853-27670-0004.flac,there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley
4853-27670-0005.flac,the brig pitched and rolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in
4853-27670-0006.flac,it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out
4853-27670-0007.flac, finding that i had the use of my voice i holloaed as loudly as i could but no human note responded three or four times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought
4853-27670-0008.flac, what has come to pass is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard certainly five men at least were living before we fouled the ice and again i cried out is there any one alive
4853-27670-0009.flac, my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness
4853-27670-0010.flac,it was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round
4853-27670-0011.flac,but no feature of my lamentable situation so affrighted me so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for one companion
4853-27670-0012.flac,even one only to make me an echo for my own speech nay got himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not the blackness laid like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul
4853-27670-0013.flac, misery and horror were within that shadow and beyond it's nothing that my spirit could look up to i stood for some moment says one stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea
4853-27670-0014.flac, reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas and that after all
4853-27670-0015.flac,her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand
4853-27670-0016.flac, by preventing the seas which washed on to the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side
4853-27670-0017.flac, my eyes directly sought it and found the time twenty minutes after ten this signified that i had ten or eleven hours of darkness before me
4853-27670-0018.flac, i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew
4853-27670-0019.flac, i swallowed half a panicking of the hollands for the sake of the warmth and life of the draught and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them
4853-27670-0020.flac, and i then with a seaman's dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days
4853-27670-0021.flac, i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log
4853-27670-0022.flac,nevertheless its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth
4853-27670-0023.flac,but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea
4853-27670-0024.flac, i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull
4853-27670-0025.flac,until coming abreast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosy there was a wound over his right brow
4853-27670-0026.flac, and as if that had not sufficed to slay him the fall of the masts had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly
4853-27670-0027.flac, that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man under a mass of rigging in the larboard scuppers lay two bodies as i could just faintly discern
4853-27670-0028.flac,for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other gear against which leaned a portion of the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away
4853-27670-0029.flac, i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seaman named abrahamwise near the forehatch
4853-27670-0030.flac,no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea
4853-27670-0031.flac, but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses
4853-27670-0032.flac, i could hear a hundred harsh and millencolly groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside wait here enough you would have supposed to stave the ship
4853-27670-0033.flac, nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless
4853-27670-0034.flac, to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easily have kept her free
4853-27670-0035.flac, i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing
4853-27670-0036.flac,and even had i managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned
4853-27671-0000.flac,there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable pall overhead into blueness the hull lay very deep
4853-27671-0001.flac, i had at one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise
4853-27671-0002.flac, and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail
4853-27671-0003.flac, yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow
4853-27671-0004.flac, one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks
4853-27671-0005.flac, had floated the jolly boat out of the long boat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell
4853-27671-0006.flac, and there lay the long boat crushed into staves this signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates
4853-27671-0007.flac,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prised her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
4853-27671-0008.flac,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water
4853-27671-0009.flac,but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her
4853-27671-0010.flac, i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham
4853-27671-0011.flac, eight or ten biscuits some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flower and thirteen bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat
4853-27671-0012.flac, the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue brows to her stem
4853-27671-0013.flac,it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her and if the swell fell over her bows and filled the decks down she would go i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money
4853-27671-0014.flac, when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her adrift the sun was an hour above the horizon
4853-27671-0015.flac, heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulders of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendour along
4853-27671-0016.flac, till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover
4853-27671-0017.flac, shot with pearly lustre floated overhead very high it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the air being dry its shrewdness was endurable
4853-27671-0018.flac, with us had it dawned yesterday instead of to day my companions would have been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last
4853-27671-0019.flac,i threw the oar over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her
4853-27671-0020.flac,into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hull floated she was something to hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon
4853-27671-0021.flac, and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her bulwarks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under
4853-27671-0022.flac, and which she dragged down with her on a sudden when the last fragment of mast had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea up rose a body with a sort of leap
4853-27671-0023.flac,it was the sailor that had lain drowned on the starboard side of the forward deck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended
4853-27671-0024.flac,so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustained by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasion by this melancholy object was so great
4853-27671-0025.flac, and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason i rose from the seat on to which i had sunk and lose the sail
4853-27671-0026.flac, and hauling the sheet aft put the oar over the stern and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course the draught of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside
4853-27671-0027.flac,the boat was about fifteen feet long
4853-27671-0028.flac, ere i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer north west and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea
4853-27671-0029.flac, where perchance i might meet a whaler or a southseaman from new holland but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard indeed
4853-27671-0030.flac, i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up and that though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts
4853-27671-0031.flac,then by sailing into the great desolation of the northwest the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering
4853-27671-0032.flac,i am persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly as the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck
4853-27671-0033.flac, and then all was bare bald swelling sea and imperled sky darkening in lagoon's of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapour lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon
4853-27671-0034.flac,but one living thing there was besides myself a grey breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hull went down and then
4853-27671-0035.flac, lifting my eyes with involuntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies
4853-27671-0036.flac,it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions and poised on tremorless wings
4853-27671-0037.flac, was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise
4853-27671-0038.flac,the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me its eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies
4853-27671-0039.flac,it was as silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature
4853-27671-0040.flac,it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope flapped its wings and after a turn or two
4853-29413-0000.flac, gloody settles the account a night of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened
4853-29413-0001.flac,the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell
4853-29413-0002.flac,the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom
4853-29413-0003.flac,the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me gloody showed himself at the door
4853-29413-0004.flac,with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir
4853-29413-0005.flac, i'm dismissed from my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked
4853-29413-0006.flac,what did he do flew into a furious rage i don't complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window
4853-29413-0007.flac,even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mister roylake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you only i don't know how
4853-29413-0008.flac, in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us two is settled now on both sides
4853-29413-0009.flac,what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause
4853-29413-0010.flac,we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little
4853-29413-0011.flac,the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll answer them to the best of my ability
4853-29413-0012.flac,the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming
4853-29413-0013.flac,the cur had betrayed himself it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested
4853-29413-0014.flac,to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed
4853-29413-0015.flac,but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned
4853-29413-0016.flac, gloody was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party
4853-29413-0017.flac,a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time
4853-29413-0018.flac, that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain
4853-29413-0019.flac,it was borne in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police
4853-29413-0020.flac,the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of you i don't mean any offence sir i pretty well guessed
4853-29413-0021.flac,that she was true as steel and not easily frightened that i didn't need to guess i knew it gloody had done his best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded
4853-29413-0022.flac,she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen
4853-29413-0023.flac,whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea yes well that was one of the signals agreed on between us
4853-29413-0024.flac,how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them
4853-29413-0025.flac,i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said
4853-29413-0026.flac,i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was honest honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor
4853-29413-0027.flac,a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we hav'n't heard of yet mister roylake i had been dressing for some time past longing to see cristel it is needless to say
4853-29413-0028.flac, is there anything more i asked that i ought to know only one thing mister roylake that i can think of gloody replied i'm afraid it's miss cristel's turn next what do you mean
4853-29413-0029.flac,while the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on miss cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars
4853-29413-0030.flac, i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars
4853-29413-0031.flac,had we any proof to justify us gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boat house no oars no oars
4853-29413-0032.flac,and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me nothing sir
5390-24512-0000.flac,for although the jewish family of the herods reigned over judea they only held their throne under the roman emperor this the jews could not endure they longed to be a free and independent nation once again
5390-24512-0001.flac,when our messiah comes he will be a great warrior they said he will utterly destroy all our enemies he will make jerusalem the greatest and richest city
5390-24512-0002.flac,had jesus of nazareth been willing to become their earthly king and to lead the nation against the romans the jews would probably have followed him to a man
5390-24512-0003.flac,the saviour sought to heal it he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centurion and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesar's
5390-24512-0004.flac,showed them the right attitude in which to regard the roman rule
5390-24512-0005.flac,the roman government had no quarrel with him thine own nation hath delivered thee unto me
5390-24512-0006.flac,had not the jews prevented it if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend they cried
5390-24512-0007.flac, to crucify jesus of nazareth and to free barabbas but in choosing the rebel barabbas
5390-24512-0008.flac,as their hero the nation started on their downward road as the story of the forty years which followed the saviour's crucifixion clearly shows for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke
5390-24512-0009.flac,and the history of those years is one long list of terrible risings and massacres while cities were ruined villages wrapped in flames and men women and children perished with hunger
5390-24512-0010.flac,yet the keener the suffering the more desperate the jews became their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge
5390-24512-0011.flac,then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not matthew
5390-24512-0012.flac,yet no sooner did a daring rebel or murderer gather a band of robbers around him and begin to kill and plunder than multitudes of jews cried the christ or messiah has come
5390-24512-0013.flac,where the roman soldiers were quartered and cried out to the garrison within that their lives should be spared if they would lay down their weapons the roman soldiers hesitated but the jews promised most faithfully to keep their word
5390-24512-0014.flac,the romans believed them and opened their gates but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man as they died the roman soldiers whom not even death could terrify
5390-24512-0015.flac,lifted up their hands to heaven as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery
5390-24512-0016.flac,and he sent a great army against jerusalem the jews shut the gates of their city and so began the awful siege of jerusalem and when he shall see jerusalem composed with armies
5390-24512-0017.flac,he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within
5390-24512-0018.flac,as one by one their defences fell and the end drew near then food failed in the city men fought like demons in the streets for a tiny loaf of barley bread so frantic were the people with hunger
5390-24512-0019.flac, that mothers even snatched the bread from their own children's mouths look over the walls o people of jerusalem the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide
5390-24512-0020.flac, hard merciless as was the roman general even he grew sick with horror at last and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews promising them their lives if they would give up the city
5390-24512-0021.flac,but a furious madness had possessed the people and they refused to yield josephus pleaded in vain he was not a christian but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people
5390-24512-0022.flac,ah my countrymen he cried we did nothing without god in the past but now you are fighting against him had god judged you worthy of freedom he would have punished the romans as he did the assyrians long ago
5390-24512-0023.flac,even a jew who had no faith in jesus christ could see plainly that the ancient power and glory of his nation had gone at last the end came the first wall fell
5390-24512-0024.flac, which still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sunbeams struck full on its golden roof then redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof
5390-24512-0025.flac, pillars fell beams crumbled to ashes while round the altar of sacrifice the people of jerusalem lay heaped together slain in such numbers in the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream
5390-24512-0026.flac,and the golden candlestick and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen rome alas for the holy city over which the saviour of the world had stood and wept forty years before
5390-24512-0027.flac,knowing the suffering that lay before her these jews are dangerous we must not allow them to rebuild their city or to become a separate people again as a nation they must cease to exist
5390-24512-0028.flac,so the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own they have indeed been led away captive into all nations
5390-24512-0029.flac,exactly as the lord foretold there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers and is the property of the turkish nation
5390-24512-0030.flac,the jews were now no longer a nation they had become merely a body of people led by their rabbis or teachers of the law but they were still the people of the book
5390-24512-0031.flac,they allowed the jewish teachers to continue the synagogue services in other parts of palestine and to teach in their colleges the most famous jewish college of these days was at tiberius on the shores of the sea of galilee
5390-24512-0032.flac,over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often and beside whose shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy a great and beautiful college it was with broad terraced gardens
5390-24512-0033.flac,so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible as we have seen the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god just as it stood they had begun even in our lord's day
5390-24512-0034.flac,that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud explanation the law of moses is like salt but the talmud is balmy spice they would say
5390-24512-0035.flac,yet although they heeded so little the true meaning of god's book they guarded its words more and more carefully and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict indeed my son and old teacher would say to his people
5390-24512-0036.flac,before you copy a single word you must wash your body all over and clothe yourself in full jewish dress preparing your mind with solemn thoughts the parchment you write upon must be made from the skins of clean animals only
5390-24512-0037.flac,that is clean according to the law of moses the ink you write with must be of a pure black made only from a mixture of soot charcoal and honey
5390-24512-0038.flac,though you know the whole book of the law by heart you must not write a single word from memory but raise your eyes to your copy and pronounce the word aloud before trusting it to your pen
5390-24512-0039.flac,before writing any of the names of god you must wash your pen before writing his most sacred name you must wash your whole body if after your copy has itself been examined three corrections have to be made
5390-24512-0040.flac,that copy must be destroyed not satisfied with all these directions the master taught his scholar to count the letters of every book
5390-24512-0041.flac, is the middle letter of all the five books of moses
5390-24512-0042.flac,is the middle of all the words
5390-24512-0043.flac, is the very center of all the verses the letter a that is it is the hebrew letter which stands for a occurs forty two thousand three hundred seventy seven times the letter b thirty five thousand two hundred eighteen
5390-24512-0044.flac,and so on not only this but every scribe was required to know from memory exactly how many letters of each kind there should be in his sheet before he began to write every sheet of parchment must contain an equal number of lines
5390-24512-0045.flac, and the breadth of each column had to be thirty letters wide there are eleven verses in the book of the law beginning and ending with n there are forty verses in which lo is read three times and so on and so on
5390-24512-0046.flac, how tedious and meaningless such information appears of what value were all these details to spend all his days in learning such things as these could have no influence on a man's character nor make him a power for good in the world
5390-24512-0047.flac,not for this purpose had god revealed his will to man some years ago in the coffin of an egyptian mummy a little jar of wheat was found for thousands of years it had lain there shut up in the dark
5390-24512-0048.flac,while out in the fields the corn which had been sown had grown up and been reaped every year and men and women had been fed but this jar of corn was useless because it had been prevented from doing the work in the world for which it was created
5390-24512-0049.flac,just so was it with the hebrew copies of god's word locked up in a dead language kept close away from the world they were like the jar of wheat which could not grow
5390-30096-0000.flac,chapter one uncle john's farm how did i happen to own a farm asked uncle john interrupting his soup long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major doyle who sat opposite
5390-30096-0001.flac, replied the major composedly it's a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you won't look after yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and ambitious young men who want a start in life oh uncle
5390-30096-0002.flac, do you do that exclaimed miss patricia doyle who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both so the major says answered uncle john drily and it's true
5390-30096-0003.flac, asserted the other he's assisted three or four score young men to start in business in the last year to my certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars
5390-30096-0004.flac,and it's the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of but i'm so glad cried patsy clapping her hands with a delighted gesture it's a splendid way to do good
5390-30096-0005.flac, without capital you know many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder and many will never get it there in any event declared the major with a shake of his grizzled head
5390-30096-0006.flac,and how can i tell whether they're deserving or not retorted major doyle fiercely do ye want me to become a sleuth or engage detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy
5390-30096-0007.flac,i just have to form a judgment and take me chances and whin a poor devil goes wrong
5390-30096-0008.flac,but some of them must succeed ventured patsy in a conciliatory tone some do said john merrick and that repays me for all my trouble
5390-30096-0009.flac,quiried the major you mean all my trouble well and your money
5390-30096-0010.flac,with one thing and another what of it retorted the little round faced millionaire leaning back in his chair and staring fixedly at the other that's what i employ you for now now gentlemen cried patsy earnestly
5390-30096-0011.flac,of his falling down and worshipping him john merrick was a multimillionaire to be sure but there were peleating circumstances that almost excused him he had been so busyly occupied in industry
5390-30096-0012.flac,that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by accident then he promptly retired to give the other fellows a chance and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity
5390-30096-0013.flac, and the welfare and entertainment of his three nieces he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of isham marvin and company
5390-30096-0014.flac,simple in his tastes modest and retiring lacking the education and refinements of polite society but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world the little man found his greatest enjoyment in the family circle
5390-30096-0015.flac, that he had been instrumental in founding being no longer absorbed in business he had come to detest its every detail and so allowed his bankers to care for his fortune and his brother in law to disperse his income
5390-30096-0016.flac,while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable he had never married
5390-30096-0017.flac,patricia was the apple of uncle john's eye and the one goddess enshrined in her doting father's heart glancing at her
5390-30096-0018.flac,in her plain muslin gown a stranger would be tempted to wonder why she was red haired freckled as a robin's egg pug gnosed and white mouth but her blue eyes were beautiful
5390-30096-0019.flac, and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that lent her face an indescribable charm everyone loved patsy doyle
5390-30096-0020.flac,and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face she was nearly seventeen years old not very tall and her form to speak charitably
5390-30096-0021.flac, he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money quite right returned uncle john nodding but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale
5390-30096-0022.flac, he was in a bad fix another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off it would take a lot of money to fight back three thousand at least
5390-30096-0023.flac,but he was decent about it after all his father had left him a little farm at millville he couldn't say what it was worth but there were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as security
5390-30096-0024.flac,if you would let him have three thousand more so you took the farm and gave him the money i did sir perhaps i am to blame
5390-30096-0025.flac, making five thousand in all well it's gone john and you've got the farm the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wegg and knocked out his patent i'm so sorry said patsy sympathetically
5390-30096-0026.flac, he replied what became of the young man asked the girl he's a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile where is millville inquired uncle john thoughtfully somewhere at the north of the state i believe
5390-30096-0027.flac, have you investigated the farm at all i looked up a real estate dealer living at milville and wrote him about the way of farm he said if any one wanted the place very badly it might sell for three thousand dollars humph
5390-30096-0028.flac,but his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at all patsy laughed poor uncle john she said the little man however was serious
5390-30096-0029.flac,for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind years ago
5390-30096-0030.flac, beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farm's the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and we'll all have a glorious lazy time
5390-30096-0031.flac,and we can take mary along to do the cooking suggested passy entering into the idea enthusiastically and eat in our short sleeves said uncle john with a glowing face and have a cow and some pigs cried the girl
5390-30096-0032.flac, you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift uncle john looked sober again any one live on the place major he inquired
5390-30096-0033.flac, it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years
5390-30102-0000.flac, chapter seven louise scents a mystery louise merrick was the eldest of uncle john's nieces having just passed her eighteenth birthday
5390-30102-0001.flac, led a mere butterfly existence her two cousins frankly agreed that louise was shallow insincere and inclined to be affected but of the three girls
5390-30102-0002.flac,and men usually admired her graceful figure and her piquant pretty face with its crown of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression there was a rumor that she was engaged to be married to arthur weldon
5390-30102-0003.flac,a young man of position in the city but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing one of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage when away from her frivolous mother
5390-30102-0004.flac,and the inconsequent home environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency one thing was indisputable however
5390-30102-0005.flac, louise merrick was a clever girl possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of others her apparent shallowness was a blind of the same character as her assumed graciousness
5390-30102-0006.flac,and while she would have been more lovable without any pretence or sham she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was patsy and beth thought they knew her
5390-30102-0007.flac, and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin uncle john thought he knew her too and was very proud of his eldest niece in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly admirable
5390-30102-0008.flac, an extensive course of light literature not void of detective stories had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to scent a mystery in the history of captain wegg
5390-30102-0009.flac, the plain folks around millville might speculate listlessly upon the queer doons at the farm and never get anywhere near the truth indeed the strange occurrences she had just heard
5390-30102-0010.flac, were nearly forgotten in the community and soon would be forgotten altogether unless the quick ear of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored at first she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking
5390-30102-0011.flac,it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at millville and in undertaking the task she laughingly abused herself of becoming an amateur detective
5390-30102-0012.flac, an occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful warned however by the rebuff she had met with from uncle john the girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed investigation to anyone for the present
5390-30102-0013.flac, louise set to work to tabulate the information she had received thus far noting the element of mystery each fact evolved first captain wegg must have been a rich man in order to build this house
5390-30102-0014.flac, Secondly the captain a surly and silent man had brought hither perhaps by force a young woman as his wife who was so unhappy that she pined away and died who was this woman
5390-30102-0015.flac, what had rendered her so unhappy and despairing thirdly the captain's only friend had been a crazy man named will thompson was he crazy before the captain's death or had he become crazed at that time
5390-30102-0016.flac,the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word why unless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible in the fifth place there was old hucks and his blind wife to be considered
5390-30102-0017.flac,what did they know about their old master's secret history what tragic memories lurked beneath the man's perpetual smile and the woman's composed and sightless face surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity
5390-30102-0018.flac, and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery and as instruments to the end there were several people available who could be of use to her mc nutt the agent who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell old hucks and his wife
5390-30102-0019.flac,and ethel thompson the school teacher there might be others but one or another of these four must know the truth and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once
5390-30102-0020.flac,when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs louise said to him i've been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness that's true he replied
5390-30102-0021.flac,can't we drive over to thompson's this morning uncle beth and patsy have planned a tramp to the lake and a row after water lilies then let us make our call together we can invite the girl to come here and spend a day with us
5390-30102-0022.flac,when patsy and beth will be able to meet her that's a good idea louise i was wondering what i'd do this morning tell old hucks to get the nag harnessed the girl ran eagerly upon her errand
5390-30102-0023.flac,but he turned without a word to harness the horse louise stood watching him your fingers are quite nimble thomas considering the fact that you were once a sailor she said but sailors have to be nimble miss he returned
5390-30102-0024.flac, buckling a strap unmoved who tol ye i were once a sea farin man i guessed it as he appeared indisposed to say more on the subject she asked did you sail with captain wegg partly miss dan's already now
5390-30102-0025.flac,don't jerk the bit fer his mouth's tender an it makes him balky ef he balks jest let him rest a time an then speak to him dan ain't vicious he's jest ornery she climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins
5390-30102-0026.flac, dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle john stood awaiting his niece
5390-30102-0027.flac, i understand dan well i don't returned uncle john in his whimsical way as he mounted to the seat beside her i don't understand how he's happened to live since the landing of columbus or what he's good for
5390-30102-0028.flac,or why someone don't knock him on the head dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane
5390-30102-0029.flac, do you know where the thompsons live inquired uncle john no whoa dan that was the best thing the nag did he knew how to whoa thomas called uncle john turning in his seat
5390-30102-0030.flac, and at the summons old hucks came from the barn and approached them how do you get to miss thompson's place miss ethel's another fleeting expression of surprise yes we're going over to thank her for her kindness to us
5390-30102-0031.flac, thompson's stammered hucks glancing up at them with his bright elusive smile well we're going anyhow growled mister merrick
5393-19218-0000.flac, the night of the sixteenth to the seventeenth of february eighteen thirty three was a blessed night above its shadows heaven stood open it was the wedding night of marius and cosette the day had been adorable
5393-19218-0001.flac, it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling

5561-39621-0002.flac,the stranger did not pay them the least attention

5561-39621-0005.flac,pay yourself added the unknown i will do so monsieur since you so positively require it a sad smile passed over the lips of the gentleman place the money on that trunk said he turning round and pointing to the piece of furniture
5561-39621-0006.flac,after having taken from it the amount of his reckoning
5561-39621-0007.flac, dinner has already been refused
5561-39621-0008.flac,the unknown asked for a glass of wine broke off a morsel of bread and did not stir from the window whilst he ate in drink
5561-39621-0009.flac, cries arose in the distance a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city and the first distinct sound that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses
5561-39621-0010.flac,with cropole were mingled and jostled on the staircase
5561-39621-0011.flac,the cortege advanced slowly lighted by a thousand flambeaux in the streets and from the windows
5561-39621-0012.flac, drawn like a carriage by four black horses
5561-39621-0013.flac,her gentlemen on horseback at both sides the king then appeared mounted upon a splendid horse of saxon breed with a flowing mane
5561-39621-0014.flac,the young prince exhibited when bowing to some windows from which issued the most animated acclamations a noble and handsome continance illuminated by the flumbo of his pages by the side of the king though a little in the rear
5561-39621-0015.flac,and twenty other courtiers followed by their people and their baggage closed this veritably triumphant march the pomp was of a military character
5561-39621-0016.flac, were traveling dresses but all the rest were clothed in warlike panoply
5561-39621-0017.flac,when the king passed before him the unknown who had leant forward over the balcony to obtain a better view and who had concealed his face by leaning on his arm felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter jealousy the noise of the trumpets excited him
5561-39621-0018.flac,the popular acclamations deffined him for a moment he allowed his reason to be absorbed in this flood of lights tumult and brilliant images he is a king murmured he in an accent of despair then before he had recovered from his somber reverie
5561-39621-0019.flac,all the noise all the splendor had passed away at the angle of the street there remained nothing beneath the stranger but a few hoarse discordant voices shouting at intervals vive le roi
5561-39621-0020.flac,how good looking the king is how strongly he resembles his illustrious father a handsome likeness said pittrino
5561-39621-0021.flac,cropole was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks without observing that an old man on foot but leading a small irish horse by the bridal was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the entrance to the medici but at that moment the voice of the stranger was heard from the window
5561-39621-0022.flac,make way monsieur l'hotelier to the entrance of your house
5561-39621-0023.flac, the window was instantly closed pittrino pointed out the way to the newly arrived guest the stranger waited for him on the landing he opened his arms to the old man and let him to his seat

5561-39621-0028.flac,but in the name of heaven do not tremble so it is in patience parry come what did the general say to you at first the general would not receive me
5561-39621-0029.flac,yes my lord but i wrote him a letter well he read it and received me my lord did that letter thoroughly explain my position in my views oh yes said parry with a sad smile it painted your very thoughts faithfully well then parry
5561-39621-0030.flac,then the general sent me back the letter by an aide de camp informing me that if i were found the next day within the circumscription of his command he would have me arrested
5561-39621-0031.flac,what arrest you my most faithful servant yes my lord and notwithstanding you had signed the name parry to all my letters my lord
5561-39621-0032.flac,the young man leaned forward thoughtful and sad ay that's what he did before his people said he endeavoring to cheat himself with hopes but privately between you and him what did he do answer
5561-39621-0033.flac,these cavaliers conducted me in great haste to the little port of tenby thru me rather than embarked me into a little fishing boat about to sail for britney and here i am oh side the young man clasping his neck convulsively with his hand and with a sob
5561-39621-0035.flac,the old man endeavored to change the conversation it was leading to thoughts much too sinister
5561-39621-0041.flac, parry are there not examples in which a man of my condition should himself my lord in the name of heaven
5561-41615-0011.flac, on wednesday aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall it was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when miss thompson walked into the room
5561-41615-0013.flac,and then she looked toward grace whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention i don't believe grace is guilty at any rate thought miss thompson then she addressed the assembled girls something has come to my ears girls said the principal
5561-41615-0023.flac,after they had stood for what seemed to them an age but was really only a couple of minutes you may be seated the girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself without hesitating eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an insolent smile
5561-41615-0032.flac,those girls who are not in any way implicated in this matter are dismissed she said about one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall the phi sigma tau being among the number
5561-41615-0037.flac, she has certainly shown her true colors this time i never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her old plan said marian barber it was abominable said eva allen the other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms
5561-41615-0046.flac,when the last girl had disappeared the principal turned to eleanor
625-132112-0003.flac,and yonder in the field is her dark young husband hoeing to support her at thirty cents a day without board across the way is gatesby brown and tall lord of two thousand acres shrewdly won and held
625-132112-0007.flac, there on the edge of town or five houses of prostitutes two of black's and three of whites and in one of the houses of the whites a worthless black boy was harboured too openly two years ago so he was hanged for rape
625-132112-0009.flac,and they not because they are guilty but because the state needs criminals to eke out its income by their forced labor immigrants are heirs of the slave baron in dougherty and as we ride westward by wide stretching cornfields and stubby orchards of peach and pear
625-132112-0012.flac,the solemn pines have disappeared and this is the oakey woods with its wealth of hickories beeches oaks and palmettos but a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful land the merchants are in debt to the wholesalers
625-132112-0013.flac,the planters are in debt to the merchants the tenants oh the planters and laborers bow and bend beneath the burden of it all here and there a man has raised his head above these murky waters
625-132112-0017.flac,even then however the fields as we proceed begin to redden and the trees disappear rows of old cabins appear filled with renters and laborers cheerless bare and dirty for the most part although here and there
625-132112-0018.flac,so he moved here where the rent is higher the land poorer and the owner inflexible he rents a forty dollar mule for twenty dollars a year poor lad a slave at twenty two this plantation owned now by a foreigner
625-132112-0020.flac, hard tales of cruelty and mistreatment of the chained freemen are told but the county authorities were deaf until the free labor market was nearly ruined by wholesale migration then they took the convicts from the plantations
625-132112-0022.flac,slow dull and discouraged shuffles to our carriage and talks hopelessly why should he strive every year finds him deeper in debt how strange that georgia the world heralded refuge of poor debtors
625-132112-0024.flac, twenty years yonder sunken cheeked old black man has labored under that system and now turned day laborer is supporting his wife and boarding himself on his wages of a dollar and a half a week received only part of the year
625-132112-0025.flac,the bolton convict farm formerly included the neighboring plantation here it was that the convicts were lodged in the great log prison still standing a dismal place it still remains with rows of ugly huts
625-132112-0026.flac, unshated with no charm of past association only a memory of forced human toil now then and before the war they are not happy these black men whom we meet throughout this region
625-132112-0027.flac, there is little of the joyous abandon and playfulness which we are wont to associate with the plantation negro at best the natural good nature is edged with complaint or has changed into sullenness and gloom
625-132112-0029.flac,as it is he is hopelessly in debt disappointed and embittered he stopped us to inquire after the black boy in albany whom it was said a policeman had shot and killed for loud talking on the sidewalk
625-132112-0030.flac,and then he said slowly let a white man touch me and he dies i don't boast this i don't say it around loud or before the children but i mean it
625-132112-0031.flac, and we passed on now sears
625-132112-0032.flac, happy well yes he laughed and flipped pebbles and thought the world was as it was he had worked here twelve years and has nothing but a mortgaged mule children yes seven but they hadn't been to school this year
625-132112-0034.flac,here and there we meet distinct characters quite out of the ordinary one came out of a piece of newly cleared ground making a wide detour to avoid the snakes he was an old hollow cheeked man with a drawn
625-132112-0035.flac, made nothing for two years but i reckon i've got a crop now the cotton looked tall and rich and we praised it he curtsied low and then bowed almost to the ground
625-132112-0036.flac, with an imperturbable gravity that seemed almost suspicious then he continued my mule died last week a calamity in this land equal to a devastating fire in town
625-132112-0037.flac,but a white man loaned me another then he added eyeing us
625-132112-0039.flac, that the concern soon landed in inextricable bankruptcy nobody lives in the old house now but a man comes each winter out of the north and collects his high rents i know not which are the more touching such old empty houses
625-132112-0040.flac,or the homes of the masters sons sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those white doors tales of poverty of struggle of disappointment a revolution such as that of sixty three is a terrible thing
625-132112-0042.flac, i remember wheeling around a bend in the road beside a graceful bit of forest and a singing brook a long low house faced us with porch and flying pillars great oaken door and a broad lawn shining in the evening sun
625-132112-0043.flac, but the window panes were gone the pillars were worm eaten and the moss grown roof was falling in half curiously i peered through the unhinged door and saw where on the wall across the hall
625-132112-0045.flac,then too there are fewer signs of a romantic past and more of systematic modern land grabbing and money getting white people are more in evidence here
625-132112-0046.flac,and there were fences and meadows here and there most of this land was poor and beneath the notice of the slave baron before the war since then his poor relations and foreign immigrants have seized it
625-132112-0047.flac,the returns of the farmer are too small to allow much for wages and yet he will not sell off small farms there is the negro sanford he has worked fourteen years as overseer on the ladson place and
625-132112-0050.flac, a weazened sharp featured little woman who curtsied quaintly as we greeted her further on lives jack delson the most prosperous negro farmer in the county it is a joy to meet him
625-132112-0051.flac,a great broad shouldered handsome black man intelligent and jovial six hundred and fifty acres he owns and has eleven black tenants a neat and tidy home nestled in a flower garden and a little store stands beside it
625-132112-0054.flac, the overseers are white and the cabins are bare board houses scattered here and there the rents are high and day laborers and contract hands abound it is a keen hard struggle for living here
625-132112-0058.flac, matronly preacher's wife plump yellow and intelligent own land said the wife well only this house then she added quietly we did buy seven hundred acres across up yonder and paid for it but they cheated us out of it
6925-80680-0000.flac,one hot night in hindustan a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice and they hoped they were going to sleep but they never did presently they became more broad awake than ever
6925-80680-0001.flac, at the sound of a howl outside the palace listen to that tiger remarked the king tiger replied by the queen how should there be a tiger inside the city it was only a jackal i tell you it was a tiger said the king and i tell you that you were dreaming
6925-80680-0002.flac,if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen i say it was a tiger cried the king don't contradict me nonsense snapped the queen it was a jackal and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at last very well
6925-80680-0003.flac, we'll call the guard and ask and if it was a jackal i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away and if it was a tiger then you shall go and i will marry a new wife as you like answered the queen there isn't any doubt which it was
6925-80680-0004.flac,so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them but whilst the dispute was going on the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other
6925-80680-0005.flac, mind you declare that the king is right it certainly was a jackal but if we say so the king will probably not keep his word about going away and we shall get into trouble so we had better take his side to this the other agreed
6925-80680-0006.flac,the king made no remark but sent for a palanquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her in spite of her tears she was forced to obey
6925-80680-0007.flac, and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood
6925-80680-0008.flac,and started home again now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back so she stayed quite still for a long time listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps
6925-80680-0009.flac,but heard none after a while she grew nervous for she was all alone and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir
6925-80680-0010.flac,but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions there was no sign of any human being then her spirit gave way and she began to cry it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest
6925-80680-0011.flac,where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbours as it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house but was awakened by the sound of weeping he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could and into the forest towards the place the sound came from
6925-80680-0012.flac, and when she had told her story the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on and in the farm a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named ameer ali
6925-80680-0013.flac, years passed without a sign from the king his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care though the queen still lived with the farmer and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong handsome and healthy youth out in the forest they seemed far from the world
6925-80680-0014.flac,very few ever came near them and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living but she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait until
6925-80680-0015.flac, at last when he was eighteen years of age they had not the heart to forbid him any longer
6925-80680-0016.flac, a big brass pot to hold water a few pieces of silver
6925-80680-0017.flac, many a weary mile he tramped day after day until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred and he stepped joyfully into it like one who goes to meet an old friend
6925-80680-0018.flac, presently as he made his way through a thicket he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner so he fired a pellet at it from his galail but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter at the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket
6925-80680-0019.flac, and on reaching the spot he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head
6925-80680-0020.flac,the old woman's face brightened she showed him where to seek the water and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim she led the way without a word and he followed in a short while they came to a hut in the forest
6925-80680-0021.flac,and as they drew near it ameer ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on at the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut and much as he wished to see her again
6925-80680-0022.flac, ameer ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back and so with a heavy heart he made his salutation and bade the old woman farewell but when he had gone a little way she called after him if ever you are in trouble or danger
6925-80680-0023.flac,come to where you now stand and cry fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me now and i will listen to you the prince thanked her and continued his journey but he thought little of the old woman's saying and much of the lovely damsel
6925-80680-0024.flac, shortly afterwards he arrived at a city and as he was now in great straits
6925-80680-0025.flac,the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more
6925-80680-0026.flac, and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous this is just what ameer ali wanted and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish
6925-80680-0027.flac, soon after this on a dark and stormy night when the river roared beneath the palace walls the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter but the servant falling on his knees in terror
6925-80680-0028.flac, begged that he might not be sent on such an errand particularly on a night so wild when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad indeed so frightened was he that the king who was very kind hearted bade another to go in his stead
6925-80680-0029.flac,but each one showed the same strange fear then ameer ali stepped forward this is my duty your majesty he said i will go the king nodded and off he went the night was as dark as pitch
6925-80680-0030.flac,but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water inch by inch and foot by foot he fought his way across now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy now narrowly escaping
6925-80680-0031.flac, being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream at length he emerged panting and dripping wet on the other side close by the bank stood a gallows and on the gallows hung the body of some evildoer
6925-80680-0032.flac, whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard
6925-80680-0033.flac,or of the roaring river as for ghosts and witches they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman what ails you he said now the woman was not really a woman at all
6925-80680-0034.flac,but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth if ever a man strayed into witchland the ograces used to eat him up and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper
6925-80680-0035.flac, in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue so when ameer ali questioned her she replied ah kind sir it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows help me to get him down and i will bless you for ever
6925-80680-0036.flac,ameer ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager
6925-80680-0037.flac, and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back which she did very nimbly then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck
6925-80680-0038.flac,but ameer ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck
6925-80680-0039.flac, and with a yellow pain and anger she vanished into the darkness ameer ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot
6925-80680-0040.flac,and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace when he had finished his story he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king who like everyone else was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it indeed
6925-80680-0041.flac,ameer ali himself was astonished for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since the king was delighted at its beauty and having praised and rewarded ameer ali he gave the anklet to his daughter a proud and spoiled princess
6925-80680-0042.flac, now in the women's apartments in the palace there hung two cages in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling and these two birds could talk as well as human beings they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was
6925-80680-0043.flac, walking grandly about with her treasure tied round her ankle she heard the starling say to the parrot
6925-80680-0044.flac, that was the parrot's name how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel think snapped the parrot who was cross because they hadn't given him his bath that morning i think she looks like a washerwoman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off
6925-80680-0045.flac, why doesn't she wear two of them instead of going about with one leg adorned and the other empty when the princess heard this she burst into tears and sending for her father
6925-80680-0046.flac,or she would die of shame so the king sent for ameer ali
6925-80680-0047.flac,or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment poor ameer ali was greatly troubled at the king's command but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans he left the palace at once
6925-80680-0048.flac, and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels were to be got but though he sought night and day he never found one to compare with the anklet at last only a week remained and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the fairy of the forest
6925-80680-0049.flac, therefore away he went and after a day's travelling he reached the cottage in the forest and standing where he had stood when the old woman called to him he cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me help me
6925-80680-0050.flac,then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten what is the matter she asked in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb
6925-80680-0051.flac,then he told her his story and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart and then turning to him she said
6925-80680-0052.flac,and hold it over the cauldron and every drop of blood that falls from it into the water will become a jewel next you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet and the one at my feet stands at my head and place the severed foot against the wound and it will heal
6925-80680-0053.flac, and i shall become quite well again as before at first
6925-80680-0054.flac, at length she persuaded him to do her bidding he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off she lay as one lifeless but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it
6925-80680-0055.flac,and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems his heart took courage very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron and he quickly changed the wands placed the severed foot against the wound and immediately the two parts became one as before
6925-80680-0056.flac,then the maiden opened her eyes sprang to her feet and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut and would not come out or speak to him any more
6925-80680-0057.flac, but three rare and beautiful anklets and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts and the next day the vain princess put two anklets on each foot
6925-80680-0058.flac, and strutted up and down in them admiring herself in the mirrors that lined her room
6925-80680-0059.flac, and never recovered his temper until after lunch she's got all her beauty at one end of her now if she had a few of those fine gew gaws round her neck and wrists she would look better but now to my mind
6925-80680-0060.flac,she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up poor princess she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill
6925-80680-0061.flac,and then she declared to her father that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die again the king sent for ameer ali and ordered him to get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month or be put to a cruel death
6925-80680-0062.flac,and again ameer ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me
6925-80680-0063.flac,once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted
6925-80680-0064.flac,and her head her words turned ameer ali pale with horror but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before and at last he consented to do as she bade him
6925-80680-0065.flac,from her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds
6925-80680-0066.flac,then the head and hands were joined on to the body and left neither sign nor scar full of gratitude ameer ali tried to speak to her but she ran into the house and would not come back and he was forced to leave her
6925-80680-0067.flac,when on the day appointed ameer ali produced a necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless than the last the king's astonishment knew no bounds and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy
6925-80680-0068.flac,the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say
6925-80680-0069.flac, how do you think our princess is looking now very fine no doubt grumbled the parrot but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only she ought to have a husband why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things
6925-80680-0070.flac,then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry ameer ali
6925-80680-0071.flac,so the king sent for ameer ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honour of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne on hearing this speech
6925-80680-0072.flac,ameer ali bowed low and answered that he had done and would do the king all the service that lay in his power save only this one thing the king who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man flew into a passion and the princess was more furious still
6925-80680-0073.flac, ameer ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find and ordered to be kept there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay
6925-80680-0074.flac,so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighbouring countries proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and heir to the throne should present himself at the palace when the day came all the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men young and old
6925-80680-0075.flac, who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone else to gain both the throne and the princess as soon as the king was seated he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer
6925-80680-0076.flac, well hasten then said the king i have no time to waste your majesty said the farmer has now lived and administered justice long in this city
6925-80680-0077.flac, whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up
6925-80680-0078.flac,no your majesty answered the farmer i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered to day to try and claim your daughter in kingdom every city has sent them and they wait hungry and eager but do not o king mistake or pretend again
6925-80680-0079.flac, to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger the king turned first red and then pale there is continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne where
6925-80680-0080.flac,growing pale as he listened in prison replied the farmer if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals i will explain clear the court commanded the king and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace now
6925-80680-0081.flac,then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up ameer ali and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside at the sight of her the king was filled with shame and self reproach and wished he could have lived his life over again
6925-80680-0082.flac,and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death my day is past said he and he gave up his crown to his son ameer ali who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne
6925-80680-0083.flac,there is only one person i will marry said he and this time the maiden did not run away but agreed to be his wife so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily as for the old woman whose pitcher ameer ali had broken
6925-80680-0084.flac,she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she gladly returned to fairyland the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife any more if he even looks as if he does not agree with her
6925-80680-0085.flac,she smiles at him and says is it the tiger then or the jackal
7067-76047-0000.flac,after twenty four eventful hours our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension
7067-76047-0001.flac, a broad and original thinker as you are thought is one matter rash inconsiderate action quite another and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of miss
7067-76047-0002.flac,and but his lower lip and considered we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite
7067-76047-0003.flac,she could for example be left behind with the luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammont there was no immediate reply
7067-76047-0004.flac,for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum i object to miss grammont and that side of the thing more than i do to miss seyffert
7067-76047-0005.flac, sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seyffert has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was
7067-76047-0006.flac, on the second occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling
7067-76047-0007.flac,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair
7067-76047-0008.flac,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeed and almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady of very good social position indeed
7067-76047-0009.flac, she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable self control and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say
7067-76047-0010.flac, i'm twice her age we are a party of four there are conventions there are considerations aren't you really my dear martineau overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests
7067-76047-0011.flac, am i said doctor martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party
7067-76047-0012.flac,there were some moments of silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said doctor martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity
7067-76047-0013.flac, i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kenelm latter at bournemouth nothing simpler than to go to him now
7067-76047-0014.flac, i shall be sorry all the same i could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened a little later the matter was settled nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said
7067-76047-0015.flac,but neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the the inconveniences your present code would set about it
7067-76047-0016.flac, and honour than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility
7067-76047-0017.flac,but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one and you if you will forgive me are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications
7067-76047-0018.flac,this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves as if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more
7067-76047-0019.flac, may involve very serious consequences indeed with which i for one do not wish to be involved sir richmond upon the hearthrug had a curious feeling that he was back in the head master's study at caxton
7067-76047-0020.flac,and in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favoured with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile
7067-76047-0021.flac, miss seyffert is a fairly crude mixture of frankness insincerity and self explanatory egotism and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me
7067-76047-0022.flac,now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond you know that she has told me as much
7067-76047-0023.flac, well she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions that is how i inferred that there was no mother i don't think there has been any stepmother
7067-76047-0024.flac,her manner with miss seyffert an excellent manner for miss seyffert by the by isn't a sort of manner any one acquires in a day or for one person only she is a very sure and commanding young woman sir richmond nodded
7067-76047-0025.flac,i suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butchered the thing has been done these business americans i am told neglect their womenkind give them money and power let them loose on the world
7067-76047-0026.flac,it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honoured amused
7067-76047-0027.flac, talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time i think this must be near the truth of her biography said sir richmond
7067-76047-0028.flac,i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them
7067-76047-0029.flac,she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss grammont is not silly
7067-76047-0030.flac, probably bored her more than she realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewellery
7067-76047-0031.flac, and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was twenty i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presents those who seek find
7067-76047-0032.flac, what do you think she found what would a rich girl find out there in america i don't know i haven't the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction
7067-76047-0033.flac,she would find that life was worthwhile to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life her monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her sex she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worthwhile for him
7067-76047-0034.flac, harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance there have been love experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there
7067-76047-0035.flac,and something more than that what it is i don't know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed
7067-76047-0036.flac,or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didn't expect it she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth she has ceased to take the world for granted it hasn't broken her but it has matured her
7067-76047-0037.flac,that i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you in her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on
7067-76047-0038.flac,she sees history as you see it and i see it she is a very grown up young woman it's just that said sir richmond it's just that if you see as much as miss grammont as all that why don't you want to come on with us you see the interest of her
7067-76047-0039.flac,i see a lot more than that you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible negligible that is the exact word to them you can't look at a woman for five minutes
7067-76047-0040.flac, seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity miss grammont has an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoilt child with no discipline
7067-76047-0041.flac,you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends you on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leeds
7067-76047-0042.flac,you i say are also at loose ends can you deny it my dear sir don't we both know that ever since we left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three ha'porth of kindness
7067-76047-0043.flac, grotesquely happen he said she knows nothing of martin leeds you must remember that and then he added if she and you fall in love
7067-76047-0044.flac,as the phrase goes what is to follow there was a pause sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offence
7067-76047-0045.flac,really he said this is preposterous you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf in our ages in our quality
7067-76047-0046.flac, from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing are men and women to go on for ever separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds
7067-76047-0047.flac,is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you two anyhow
7067-76047-0048.flac,and at present the world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the core of this situation a pause fell between the two gentlemen
7067-76047-0049.flac,they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martineau
7067-76048-0000.flac,i leave you to it his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation ought you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond i shall be interested to learn what happens but if you won't stay to see
7067-76048-0001.flac,now sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and doctor martineau got in sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit what else could i do he asked aloud to nobody in particular
7067-76048-0002.flac,section two for the better part of forty hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence
7067-76048-0003.flac,and she repeated no remembered comments and prophets of her contemporaries about herself she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality
7067-76048-0004.flac,but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences and her liking for sir richmond was pleasingly manifest
7067-76048-0005.flac,she liked his turn of thought she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favoured visitor
7067-76048-0006.flac,as a crisis in which they were called upon to do something they did not yet clearly know what into this topic they peered as into some deep pool side by side and in it they saw each other reflected
7067-76048-0007.flac, its delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch both miss grammont and miss seyffert displayed an intelligent interest in their food after lunch they had all gone out to the stones and the wall
7067-76048-0008.flac, to a happy use by clambering to the top of it and sliding on their little behinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing
7067-76048-0009.flac, sir richmond and miss grammont had walked round the old circumvallation together but belinda seyffert had strayed away from them professing an interest in flowers
7067-76048-0010.flac, that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards that new world of yours of two hundred and fifty million fully developed beautiful and happy people why not
7067-76048-0011.flac,nobody is doing anything with the world except muddle about why not give it a direction you'd take it in your hands like clay obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its own
7067-76048-0012.flac,her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice i believe what you say is possible if people dare i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them
7067-76048-0013.flac,i am tired of seeing all the world doing the same i am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great disasters here is something mankind can attempt that we can attempt and will i believe that as mankind grows up
7067-76048-0014.flac, and pride ourselves upon our freedom from the sin of presumption not quite that well how do you put it we are afraid she said it's too vast we want bright little lives of our own
7067-76048-0015.flac, sensible little piggy wiggys we have a right to life and happiness first said sir richmond as much right as a pig has to food but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings
7067-76048-0016.flac, who have imaginations want something more nowadays of course we want bright lives of course we want happiness just as we want food just as we want sleep but when we have eaten when we have slept when we have jolly things about us it is nothing
7067-76048-0017.flac,we have been made an exception of and got our rations the big thing confronts us still
7067-76048-0018.flac, i do not know why it should be so but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind i want it as my culminating want i want a world in order
7067-76048-0019.flac, a disciplined mankind going on to greater things don't you now you tell me of it she said with a smile i do but before no you've made it clear it wasn't clear before
7067-76048-0020.flac, i've been talking of this sort of thing with my friend doctor martineau and i've been thinking as well as talking that perhaps is why i'm so clear and positive i don't complain that you are clear and positive i've been coming along the same way
7067-76048-0021.flac,it's refreshing to meet you i found it refreshing to meet martineau a twinge of conscience about doctor martineau turned sir richmond into a new channel he's a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects
7067-76048-0022.flac, devoted to his work and he's writing a book which has saturated him in these ideas only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it the psychology of a new age the world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its history
7067-76048-0023.flac,the adolescence so to speak of mankind it is an idea that seizes the imagination there is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears
7067-76048-0024.flac,there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities we are sharing the adolescence of our race it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us
7067-76048-0025.flac,making them matter as formerly they didn't seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before
7067-76048-0026.flac, incidentally he smiled i want to get a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbarer person your father i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world control of fuel production and distribution
7067-76048-0027.flac,but controlling father as distinguished from managing him she reviewed some private and amusing memories he is a most intractable man section three
7067-76048-0028.flac,they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own
7067-76048-0029.flac,gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives
7067-76048-0030.flac,you will find my father extremely difficult but some of our younger men would love it and she went on there are american women who'd love it too we're petted we're kept out of things we aren't placed
7067-76048-0031.flac,we don't get enough to do we're spenders and wasters not always from choice while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker
7067-76048-0032.flac,with all the empty unspeakable solemnity of the male and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings that can't go on she said her eyes went back to the long low undulating skyline of the downs
7067-76048-0033.flac,she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life that isn't going on she said with an effect of conclusive decision
7067-76048-0034.flac, sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martineau he recalled too the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin
7067-76048-0035.flac, he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments
7067-76048-0036.flac, in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality martineau was very fine minded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter
7067-76048-0037.flac,but passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest then it wasn't so necessary it might happen
7067-76048-0038.flac,her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond i realize i've got to be a responsible american citizen she had said
7067-76048-0039.flac,that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well
7067-76048-0040.flac,she had no illusions about the power of the former class it didn't exist they were steered to their decisions by people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates the owners of america the real responsible citizens
7067-76048-0041.flac,or they fell a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries but anyhow they were steered she herself it was clear was bound to become a very responsible citizen indeed
7067-76048-0042.flac,she would some day she laughed be swimming in oil and such like property her interest in sir richmond's schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was therefore she realized a very direct one but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that
7067-76048-0043.flac,father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son
7067-76048-0044.flac, at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mister grammont's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost
7067-76048-0045.flac,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all
7067-76048-0046.flac,he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicality of his life's ideal there was hetty green this latter idea had left her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe
7067-76048-0047.flac,after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and an office downtown she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mister grammont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard
7067-76048-0048.flac,she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two menservants
7067-76048-0049.flac,this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into mexico there apparently she had really done responsible work but upon the question of labour mister grammont was fierce
7067-76048-0050.flac,he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas
7067-76048-0051.flac,and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way
7067-76048-0052.flac, mister lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment there was some story however connected with her war services in europe upon which miss grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell
7067-76048-0053.flac,still quite vaguely guessing so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as allusions or by way of illustration
7067-76048-0054.flac,the sustaining topic was this new age sir richmond foreshadowed this world under scientific control the utopia of fully developed people fully developing the resources of the earth
7067-76048-0055.flac,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to doctor martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that doctor martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him
7067-76048-0056.flac,but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with doctor martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings
7067-76048-0057.flac,and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise to morrow the new age will be here no doubt but to day it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings so that it was natural for miss grammont and sir richmond to ask
7067-76048-0058.flac,what are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically ordered
7067-76048-0059.flac, an immense organization of mature commonsense healthy and secure gathering knowledge and power for creative adventures as yet beyond dreaming
7067-76048-0060.flac, and replaceable structures indeed both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before
7113-86041-0000.flac,rubezahl over all the vast under world the mountain gnome rubezahl was lord and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through
7113-86041-0001.flac,and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies
7113-86041-0002.flac,for rubezahl loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing
7113-86041-0003.flac,and as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things for the first time he came up the great hills were covered with thick forests
7113-86041-0004.flac, to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills but the next time he ventured above ground what was his surprise to find everything changed the dark woods were hewn down
7113-86041-0005.flac, and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosy looking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows
7113-86041-0006.flac,came the music of the shepherd's pipe the strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests who without saying by your leave or with your leave
7113-86041-0007.flac,nor did he wish to interfere with their doings but left them in quiet possession of their homes as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves
7113-86041-0008.flac,he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man so taking the form of an old field labourer he entered the service of a farmer under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly
7113-86041-0009.flac,but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful and rubezahl soon left him and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour
7113-86041-0010.flac, and where among the hills to look for it for any who straight away that they too prospered under his care and not one was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well earned wages
7113-86041-0011.flac,so he ran away and went to serve the judge here he upheld the law with might and main and was a terror to thieves and evildoers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law
7113-86041-0012.flac,down to his underground palace very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind but as time went on he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him and thought he would take another look at the upper world
7113-86041-0013.flac, where stood a charming maiden fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon around her upon the grass lay her young companions as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game
7113-86041-0014.flac, beyond them flowed a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide
7113-86041-0015.flac,the sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven
7113-86041-0016.flac,he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels and a nest of field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens
7113-86041-0017.flac,when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young man that was the best way and he fell in love with a girl then and there
7113-86041-0018.flac,the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country and she often wandered in the forest with her playfellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits till the midday he drove the merry band to the shady lawn
7113-86041-0019.flac, by the brook to rest or to bathe in the cool waters on this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood this
7113-86041-0020.flac, stepping out of his hiding place
7113-86041-0021.flac, weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting place they stood lost and amazement and almost fancied that they must be dreaming
7113-86041-0022.flac,the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed flowed in silence now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt
7113-86041-0023.flac,as the wandering breeze scattered it days east and forget me knots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable
7113-86041-0024.flac, were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes
7113-86041-0025.flac,but at length curiosity prevailed and she and her companions explored to their heart's content
7113-86041-0026.flac, running hither and thither in high glee and calling merrily to each other at last when they were quite weary the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool
7113-86041-0027.flac, which certainly did look very inviting and they all went gaily to this new amusement the princess was ready first but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down down down down down she sank
7113-86041-0028.flac, and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair loudly did they weep and wail running about the brink of the pool which looked so shallow and so clear
7113-86041-0029.flac,but which had swallowed up their princess before their eyes they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her but in vain they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool and could not keep under water for a second
7113-86041-0030.flac,they saw at last that there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughter's disappearance and what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told
7113-86041-0031.flac, the scene of this strange adventure thinking as people will in sorrow that there might be some mistake after all but when he reached the spot behold all was changed again
7113-86041-0032.flac,the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished and so had the marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old
7113-86041-0033.flac,the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princess's playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some
7113-86041-0034.flac,sprite or goblin and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy
7113-86041-0035.flac,they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her father's seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch
7113-86041-0036.flac, wrapped in a wonderful robe satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who whispered sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he was told her all about himself
7113-86041-0037.flac, and his great underground kingdom and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendour
7113-86041-0038.flac,on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady which pleased the eye of the princess the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples
7113-86041-0039.flac, and knighting gale saying in every bush as the gnome in the princess wandered in the leafy allies sometimes gazing at the moon sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her dormant
7113-86041-0040.flac,but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displacing the gnome however he soon perceived her milling calling
7113-86041-0041.flac,and in a thousand ways strove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants
7113-86041-0042.flac, who is there i can find for her to talk to
7113-86041-0043.flac, carats turnips and radishes and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who sat pensive in the shade of the rose bower loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow
7113-86041-0044.flac,no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling
7113-86041-0045.flac,take this little many coloured wand and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see with this he left her and the princess without an instant's delay opened the basket
7113-86041-0046.flac,his satan appearance was so defliteful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden
7113-86041-0047.flac, and gathered the golden apples from the trees and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments
7113-86041-0048.flac, the gnome had given to his hoped for bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes veils girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired
7113-86041-0049.flac, and showed so much taste that nobody
7113-86041-0050.flac,the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before
7113-86041-0051.flac,she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand and soon had all her maidens about her and even as she had two tiny radishes to spare
7113-86041-0052.flac, whose name was benny and now all went cheerfully in the castle the princess gave to each of the maidens her task and never was mistress better served for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed
7113-86041-0053.flac,they played from morning to night only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom
7113-86041-0054.flac,while brunhilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away
7113-86041-0055.flac, to take part in the games of the princess till at last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows she shuddered
7113-86041-0056.flac, and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones with bent backs and trembling limbs who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth
7113-86041-0057.flac, lay the once frolic some binny with all four feet stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cussion the horrified princess fled to the door
7113-86041-0058.flac,the greatest delight of my lonely hours isn't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your turning the castle into a hospital for the aged give my maidens back their youth and health this very minute or i will never love you
7113-86041-0059.flac, sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will do but do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots
7113-86041-0060.flac,the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired but as the sap dried up they withered away but never trouble yourself about that dearest one a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right
7113-86041-0061.flac, and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see the great green patch in the garden will prove you with a more lively company so saying the gnome took himself off
7113-86041-0062.flac,and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow
7113-86041-0063.flac, to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found
7113-86041-0064.flac,by the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off
7113-86041-0065.flac, dear queen of my heart answered he i pray you to forgive my carelessness i promised more than i could perform i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty cellars
7113-86041-0066.flac,and the fields are bare and desolate for below in the valley winter reigns only here in your presence spring is held fast and wherever your foot is set the gay flowers bloom have patience for a little
7113-86041-0067.flac,and then without fail you shall have your poppets to play with almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without dainting to answer him the gnome however
7113-86041-0068.flac,and disguising himself as a farmer bought an ass in the nearest market town and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip carrot and radish seed with this he sold a great field
7113-86041-0069.flac, and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds thus fostered they grew and flourished marvellously
7113-86041-0070.flac,he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him but that was a mistake for the truth was that another image already filled her heart the young prince ratibor whose lands joined her fathers had won the heart of the princess
7113-86041-0071.flac,looking forward to the coming of their wedding day when the bride's mysterious disappearance took place the sad news drove ratibor distracted and as the days went on and nothing could be heard of the princess he forsook his castle
7113-86041-0072.flac, and the society of men and spent his days in the wild forests roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks meanwhile the maiden in her gorgeous prison sighed in secret over her grief not wishing to arouse the gnome's suspicions
7113-86041-0073.flac,in her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity and at last she hit upon a plan by this time spring once more reigned in the valley and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth
7113-86041-0074.flac, for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them conjuring up now this longed for person and now that
7113-86041-0075.flac,just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another purpose in view one day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover fly
7113-86041-0076.flac,so the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up
7113-86041-0077.flac,then and there after that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting hop little cricket to ratibor and chirp in his ear that i love him only
7113-86041-0078.flac,but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains so the cricket hopped off gaily determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a long ligot's stork who was prancing along the same road
7113-86041-0079.flac, caught him in her cruel beak and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more
7113-86041-0080.flac,this time she changed the turnip into a magpie flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said she till you come to ratibor my love
7113-86041-0081.flac,and bid him come with horses and men the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley the magpie listened hopped awhile from branch to branch and then darted away
7113-86041-0082.flac,now prince ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief one day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud
7113-86041-0083.flac, which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever thereupon he caught up a great stone
7113-86041-0084.flac,but the magpie in the tree who like
7113-86041-0085.flac,unless he could be for ever chattering
7113-86041-0086.flac,all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learned so he soon fluttered away
7113-86041-0087.flac,while the prince hurried back to his castle to gather together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall the princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of escape
7113-86041-0088.flac,she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love and the idea pleased him mightily the next day
7113-86041-0089.flac, as soon as the sun rose she made her appearance decked as a bride in the wonderful robes and jewels which the fond gnome had prepared for her her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle blossoms
7113-86041-0090.flac,and her flowing veil sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes
7113-86041-0091.flac,your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears why tears beloved one cried the gnome anxiously
7113-86041-0092.flac,every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold greatly as i desire your love i do not ask a sacrifice ah cried the falls princess why do you misunderstand my tears
7113-86041-0093.flac, and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now
7113-86041-0094.flac,ask some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love be it so answered the crafty maiden then give me
7113-86041-0095.flac,that shall be the test of your truth towards me unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task
7113-86041-0096.flac,he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again
7113-86041-0097.flac,this time to his great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princesses
7113-86041-0098.flac, pretty looks and words as for the maiden no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand
7113-86041-0099.flac,which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself
7113-86041-0100.flac,into the arms of her beloved prince ratibor meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again till his back ached and his head swam and he could no longer put two and two together
7113-86041-0101.flac,but as he felt tolerably certain of the exact number of turnips in the field big and little together he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be he felt very well satisfied with himself
7113-86041-0102.flac,as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her but alas she was no longer there he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond
7113-86041-0103.flac, but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name but only
7113-86041-0104.flac, echo answered in the marble halls there was neither voice nor footstep then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace
7113-86041-0105.flac, and soared high into the air and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions furiously
7113-86041-0106.flac, and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years but his fury was vain the thunder clouds melted away into a soft mist
7113-86041-0107.flac, and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stole once more through every room with many sighs and lamentations
7113-86041-0108.flac,he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princess's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief always lonely empty sorrowful
7113-86041-0109.flac,and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures
7113-86041-0110.flac, to the depths of his underground kingdom
7517-100429-0000.flac,the pond my friend aldenham's pond stands at a convenient distance from the house and is reached by a well drained gravel path so that in any weather one may walk
7517-100429-0001.flac, alone or in company dry shod to its brink and estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen in the night the ribald call it the hippopotamus pond tracing
7517-100429-0002.flac,a resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the zoo beneath the waters of which if you particularly desire to point the hippopotamus out to somebody he always lies hidden to the rest of us
7517-100429-0003.flac,it is known simply as the pond a designation which ignores the existence of several neighbouring ponds the gifts of nature and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man
7517-100429-0004.flac,for the pond is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious there are seven steps to the bottom of the pond and each step
7517-100429-0005.flac, thus the steps help to make the pond a convenient rain gauge for obviously when only three steps are left uncovered as was the case last monday
7517-100429-0006.flac,when the pond began to fill to strangers this may seem surprising and it is only fair to tell them the great secret which is that much of the surrounding land
7517-100429-0007.flac,drains secretly into the pond too this seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers
7517-100429-0008.flac,for when your whole day's cricket has been spoilt it is perfectly absurd
7517-100429-0009.flac, has done the damage the soul yearns for something more startling than that the record of the pond
7517-100429-0010.flac, soothes us where the record of the ordinary pedantic rain gauge would leave us infuriated it speaks much for my friend aldenham's breadth of view that he understood this
7517-100429-0011.flac, and planned the pond accordingly a most necessary thing in a country house is that there should be a recognized meeting place
7517-100429-0012.flac,where the people who have been writing a few letters after breakfast may when they have finished meet those who have no intention of writing any and arrange plans with them for the morning
7517-100429-0013.flac, i am one of those who cannot write letters in another man's house and when my pipe is well alight i say to miss robinson or whoever it may be let's go and look at the pond
7517-100429-0014.flac, right oh she says willingly enough having spent the last quarter of an hour with the times financial supplement all of the paper that is left to the women in the first rush for the cricket news
7517-100429-0015.flac, we wander down to the pond together and perhaps find brown and miss smith there a lot of rain in the night says brown it was only just over the third step after lunch yesterday
7517-100429-0016.flac, we have a little argument about it miss robinson being convinced that she stood on the second step after breakfast and miss smith repeating that it looks
7517-100429-0017.flac, by and by two or three others stroll up and we all make measurements together the general opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night
7517-100429-0018.flac, must be a record but anyhow it is fairly fine now and what about a little lawn tennis or golf or croquet or and so the arrangements for the morning are made
7517-100429-0019.flac,and they can be made more readily out of doors for supposing it is fine the fresh air calls you to be doing something and the sight of the newly marked tennis lawn
7517-100429-0020.flac,fills you with thoughts of revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before but indoors it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast and once there with all the papers
7517-100429-0021.flac,to be disinclined to leave it till lunch time a man or woman as lazy as this must not be rushed say to such a one come and play and the invitation
7517-100429-0022.flac, will be declined say come and look at the pond and the worst sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise and once he is out he is out
7517-100429-0023.flac,all this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents
7517-100429-0024.flac, from morning till night how tired we get of being indoors on these days even with the best of books the pleasantest of companions the easiest of billiard tables
7517-100429-0025.flac,yet if our hostess were to see us marching out with an umbrella how odd she would think us where are you off to she would ask and we could only answer lamely
7517-100429-0026.flac, er i was just going to er walk about a bit but now we tell her brightly i'm going to see the pond it must be nearly full won't you come too and with any luck she comes
7517-100429-0027.flac, to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond for there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full
7517-100429-0028.flac, what will happen then all den ham may know but we his guests do not some think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and the kitchen garden but for myself
7517-100429-0029.flac,i believe that we are promised something much bigger than that a man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives
7517-100429-0030.flac, will help to celebrate it i have no doubt with an open air play tank drama or what not at any rate we have every hope that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible
7517-100429-0031.flac, so that we may watch it fill again i must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond but all the same
7517-100429-0032.flac, have fallen in the last three weeks
7517-100437-0000.flac, a household book once on a time i discovered samuel butler not the other two but the one who wrote the way of all flesh the second best novel in the english language
7517-100437-0001.flac, i say the second best so that if you remind me of tom jones or the mayor of casterbridge or any other that you fancy i can say that of course that one is the best
7517-100437-0002.flac, well i discovered him just as valtaire discovered habacuck or your little boy discovered Shakespeare the other day and i committed my discovery to the world
7517-100437-0003.flac, in two glowing articles not unnaturally the world remained unmoved it knew all about samuel butler last week i discovered a frenchman
7517-100437-0004.flac,who wrote in the early part of last century a book called
7517-100437-0005.flac,my uncle benjamin i read it in the translation eager as i am to be lyrical about it i shall refrain i think that i am probably safer with tillier than with butler
7517-100437-0006.flac,but i dare not risk it the thought of your scorn at my previous ignorance of the world famous tillier your amused contempt because i have only just succeeded
7517-100437-0007.flac,in borrowing the classic upon which you were brought up this is too much for me let us say no more about it
7517-100437-0008.flac,who has not heard of claude tillier
7517-100437-0009.flac,who has not read it in french or as i did in american let us pass on to another book for i am going to speak of another discovery
7517-100437-0010.flac, of a book which should be a classic but is not of a book of which nobody has heard unless through me it was published some twelve years ago the last published book
7517-100437-0011.flac, of a well known writer when i tell you his name you will say oh yes i love his books and you will mention so and so and its equally famous sequel such and such
7517-100437-0012.flac, but when i ask you if you have read my book you will profess surprise and say that you have never heard of it is it as good as so and so and such and such you will ask
7517-100437-0013.flac, hardly believing that this could be possible much better i shall reply and there if these things were arranged properly would be another ten per cent in my pocket but believe me
7517-100437-0014.flac,i shall be quite content with your gratitude well the writer of my book is kenneth grahame you have heard of him good i thought so the books you have read
7517-100437-0015.flac, are the golden age and dream days am i not right thank you but the book you have not read my book
7517-100437-0016.flac,the wind and the willows am i not right again ah i was afraid so the reason why i knew you had not read it is the reason why i call it my book
7517-100437-0017.flac, for the last ten or twelve years i have been recommending it usually i speak about it at my first meeting with a stranger it is my opening remark just as yours is something futile about the weather
7517-100437-0018.flac,if i don't get it in at the beginning i squeeze it in at the end the stranger has got to have it some time should i ever find myself in the dock and one never knows
7517-100437-0019.flac, my answer to the question whether i had anything to say would be well my lord if i might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving mister justice darling
7517-100437-0020.flac, would probably pretend that he had read it but he wouldn't deceive me for one cannot recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering
7517-100437-0021.flac,whether it is well known or not it is the amazing truth that none of those hundreds had heard of the wind in the willows until i told them about it
7517-100437-0022.flac, some of them had never heard of kenneth grahame well one did not have to meet them again and it takes all sorts to make a world but most of them were in your position
7517-100437-0023.flac, great admirers of the author and his two earlier famous books but ignorant thereafter i had their promise before they left me and waited confidently
7517-100437-0024.flac, for their gratitude no doubt they also spread the good news in their turn and it is just possible that it reached you in this way but it was to me
7517-100437-0025.flac, none the less that your thanks were due for instance you may have noticed a couple of casual references to it as if it were a classic known to all in a famous novel
7517-100437-0026.flac, published last year it was i who introduced that novelist to it six months before indeed i feel sometimes that it was i who wrote the wind in the willows
7517-100437-0027.flac, and recommended it to kenneth grahame but perhaps i am wrong here for i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance nor as i have already lamented am i financially interested in its sale
7517-100437-0028.flac, an explanation which suspicious strangers require from me sometimes i shall not describe the book for no description would help it but i shall just say this
7517-100437-0029.flac, that it is what i call a household book by a household book i mean a book which everybody in the household loves and quotes continually ever afterwards a book which is read aloud
7517-100437-0030.flac, to every new guest and is regarded as the touchstone of his worth but it is a book which makes you feel that though everybody in the house loves it it is only you
7517-100437-0031.flac,who really appreciate it at its true value and that the others are scarcely worthy of it it is obvious you persuade yourself that the author was thinking of you
7517-100437-0032.flac,when he wrote it i hope this will please jones were his final words as he laid down his pen well of course you will order the book at once
7517-100437-0033.flac,but i must give you one word of warning when you sit down to it don't be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgment on my taste
7517-100437-0034.flac,still less on the genius of kenneth grahame you are merely sitting in judgment on yourself you may be worthy i do not know
7517-100442-0000.flac, at the bookstall i have often longed to be a grocer to be surrounded by so many interesting things sardines bottled raspberries
7517-100442-0001.flac, biscuits with sugar on the top preserved ginger hams brawn under glass everything in fact that makes life worth living
7517-100442-0002.flac,at one moment to walk up a ladder in search of nutmeg at the next to dive under a counter in pursuit of cinnamon to serve little girls
7517-100442-0003.flac,and lordly people like you and me with a pint of cherry gin is not this to follow the king of trades some day i shall open a grocer's shop and you will find me in my spare evenings
7517-100442-0004.flac, aproned behind the counter look out for the currants in the window as you come in i have an idea for something artistic in the way of patterns there but as you love me do not offer to buy any
7517-100442-0005.flac, we grocers only put the currants out for show and so that we may run our fingers through them luxuriously when business is slack i have a good line in shortbreads madam if i can find the box
7517-100442-0006.flac,but no currants this evening i beg you yes to be a grocer is to live well but after all it is not to see life a grocer
7517-100442-0007.flac, in as far as it is possible to a man who sells both scented soap and pilt yards would become narrow we do not come into contact with the outside world much save through the medium of potted lobster
7517-100442-0008.flac,and to sell a man potted lobster is not to have our fingers on his pulse potted lobster does not define a man all customers are alike to the grocer provided their money is good
7517-100442-0009.flac,i perceive now that i was over hasty in deciding to become a grocer that is rather for one's old age while one is young and interested in persons rather than in things
7517-100442-0010.flac,there is only one profession to follow the profession of bookstall clerk to be behind a bookstall is indeed to see life the fascination of it struck me suddenly
7517-100442-0011.flac,last monday and wondered who bought the tie clips the answer came to me just as i got into my train ask the man behind the bookstall he would know
7517-100442-0012.flac,yes and he would know who bought all his papers and books and pamphlets and to know this is to know something about the people in the world
7517-100442-0013.flac,you cannot tell a man by the lobster he eats but you can tell something about him by the literature he reads for instance i once occupied a carriage on an eastern line
7517-100442-0014.flac,with among others a middle aged woman as soon as we left liverpool street she produced a bag of shrimps grasped each individual in turn firmly by the head and tail
7517-100442-0015.flac,and ate him when she had finished she emptied the ends out of the window wiped her hands and settled down comfortably to her paper what paper you'll never guess
7517-100442-0016.flac,i shall have to tell you the morning post now doesn't that give you the woman the shrimps alone no the paper alone no but the two to gether
7517-100442-0017.flac, conceive the holy joy of the bookstall clerk as she and her bag of shrimps yes he could have told at once they were shrimps approached and asked for the morning post
7517-100442-0018.flac,the day can never be dull to the bookstall clerk i imagine him assigning in his mind the right paper to each customer this man will ask for gulfing wrong
7517-100442-0019.flac,he wants cage birds that one over there wants the motor ah well the auto car that's near enough soon he would begin to know the different types he would learn to distinguish
7517-100442-0020.flac, between the patrons of the dancing times and of the vote the era and the athename delightful surprises would overwhelm him at intervals as when
7517-100442-0021.flac, a red letter day in all the great stations a gentleman in a check waistcoat makes the double purchase of homer's penny stories and the spectator on those occasions
7517-100442-0022.flac, and they would be very rare his faith in human nature would begin to ooze away until all at once he would tell himself excitedly that the man was obviously an escaped criminal in disguise
7517-100442-0023.flac,rather overdoing the part after which he would hand over the winning post and the animals friend to the pursuing detective in a sort of holy awe what a life
7517-100442-0024.flac, but he has other things than papers to sell he knows who buys those little sixpenny books of funny stories a problem which has often puzzled us others
7517-100442-0025.flac,he understands by now the type of man who wants to read up a few good jokes to tell them down at old robinson's where he is going for the week end our bookstall clerk doesn't wait to be asked
7517-100442-0026.flac,as soon as this gentleman approaches he whips out the book dusts it and places it before the rack on tour he recognizes also at a glance the sort of silly ass
7517-100442-0027.flac, who is always losing his indiarubber umbrella ring half way across the station he can see him and he hastens to get a new card out in readiness or we would let you have seven for sixpence sir
7517-100442-0028.flac, and even when one of those subtler characters draws near about whom it is impossible to say immediately whether they require a fountain pen with case or the life and letters
7517-100442-0029.flac,of major general clement bulger c b even then the man behind the bookstall is not found wanting if he is wrong the first time he never fails to recover with his second bulger sir
7517-100442-0030.flac,one of our greatest soldiers i thought of these things last monday and definitely renounced the idea of becoming a grocer and as i wandered round the bookstall thinking
7517-100442-0031.flac,i came across a little book six pence and cloth a shilling and leather called proverbs and maxims it contained some thousands of the best thoughts in all languages
7517-100442-0032.flac,such as have guided men along the path of truth since the beginning of the world from what ho she bumps to ich dien and more the thought occurred to me
7517-100442-0033.flac, that an interesting article might be extracted from it so i bought the book unfortunately enough i left it in the train before i had time to master it i shall be at the bookstall next monday
7517-100442-0034.flac, and i shall have to buy another copy that will be all right you shan't miss it but i am wondering now what the bookstall clerk will make of me a man who keeps on buying proverbs and maxims
7780-274562-0000.flac,the azure fields of heaven were sembled right in a large round set with flowers of light the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew that hung upon their azure leaves did show like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue
7780-274562-0001.flac, giles flutter no more remarkable man ever lived than my friend the young ellison he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune
7780-274562-0002.flac,from his cradle to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness
7780-274562-0003.flac,the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of turgurl price priestley and condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance
7780-274562-0004.flac,what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma that in man's physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle
7780-274562-0005.flac,the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of his career has taught me to understand that in general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind
7780-274562-0006.flac, that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content and that even now in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the social condition
7780-274562-0007.flac,it is not impossible that man the individual under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued
7780-274562-0008.flac, and thus is it especially where the observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert it is indeed evident
7780-274562-0009.flac, experience mister ellison would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments
7780-274562-0010.flac,but it is by no means my present object to pen and essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words he admitted but for a varying loss
7780-274562-0011.flac, or rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air the health he said
7780-274562-0012.flac, attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name he pointed to the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class are proverbially more happy than others
7780-274562-0013.flac, and then he instant the high ecstasy of the fox hunter his second principal was the love of woman
7780-274562-0014.flac,his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he held that other things being equal the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object
7780-274562-0015.flac,i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men
7780-274562-0016.flac,his intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women
7780-274562-0017.flac,his possessions had been always ample but upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur
7780-274562-0018.flac, and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it appears that about one hundred years prior to mister ellison's attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province
7780-274562-0019.flac, listen this gentleman had massed a princely fortune and having no very immediate connections conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease
7780-274562-0020.flac, minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the end of the hundred years
7780-274562-0021.flac, many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character rendered them abortive
7780-274562-0022.flac, a decree finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison upon his twenty first birth day
7780-274562-0023.flac,from entering into possession as the heir of his ancestor seabright of a fortune of
7780-274562-0024.flac,there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic
7780-274562-0025.flac,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen
7780-274562-0026.flac,it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigues or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility
7780-274562-0027.flac, or devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large specimens of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters and art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity
7780-274562-0028.flac, but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to figures
7780-274562-0029.flac,and figures but sufficed to confound it was seen that even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars
7780-274562-0030.flac, which was one million and one hundred and twenty five thousand per month or thirty six thousand nine hundred and eighty six per day or one thousand five hundred and forty one per day or one thousand five hundred and forty one per hour or
7780-274562-0031.flac, six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to imagine
7780-274562-0032.flac,enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance i was not surprised however
7780-274562-0033.flac,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet he comprehended moreover the true character the august aims
7780-274562-0034.flac,the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some peculiarities either in his early education
7780-274562-0035.flac,or in the nature of his intellect
7780-274562-0036.flac, and it was this bias perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment
7780-274562-0037.flac, was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its every day acceptation
7780-274562-0038.flac,or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his which i have already mentioned the idea that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth
7780-274562-0039.flac, is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition
7780-274562-0040.flac, and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen and that
7780-274562-0041.flac, unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion the world will never behold that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer productions of art
7780-274562-0042.flac, of which the human nature is absolutely capable mister ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more profoundly ennormed both of music and amamuse
7780-274562-0043.flac,under other circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become a painter the feud of sculpture although in its nature rigidly political
7780-274562-0044.flac, l was too limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied at any time much of his attention and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which
7780-274562-0045.flac,even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating i mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment
7780-274562-0046.flac,no definition had spoken of the landscape gardener as of the poet yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the landscape garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities
7780-274562-0047.flac,here was indeed the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty
7780-274562-0048.flac,the elements which should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in the multiform of the tree
7780-274562-0049.flac, and in the multicolor of the flower he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness and in the direction or concentration of this effort or
7780-274562-0050.flac,he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment of his destiny as poet
7780-274562-0051.flac, its adaptation to the eyes which were to be holded upon earth in his explanation of this phraseology mister ellison did much toward solving was always seemed to me an enigma i mean the fact
7780-274562-0052.flac, which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce
7780-274562-0053.flac,while the component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short no position can be attained
7780-274562-0054.flac, from which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is this
7780-274562-0055.flac, in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the color of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley
7780-274562-0056.flac,the criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points
7780-274562-0057.flac,of human loveliness do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path byron who often erred erred not in saying i've seen more living beauty
7780-274562-0058.flac, ripe and real than all the nonsense of their stone ideal and landscape alone is the principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here
7780-274562-0059.flac,it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art having i say felt its truth here
7780-274562-0060.flac,for the feeling is no affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist he not only believes
7780-274562-0061.flac, but positively knows that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form constitute and alone constitute the true beauty
7780-274562-0062.flac,yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them
7780-274562-0063.flac, in his instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his peers let a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form
7780-274562-0064.flac,let this amendation be submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity be admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective composition
7780-274562-0065.flac, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that
7780-274562-0066.flac, therefore her susceptibility of improvement
7780-274562-0067.flac,it was mister ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty
7780-274562-0068.flac, that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens
7780-274562-0069.flac,it is easily understood says mister ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a general and more distantly observed effect
7780-274562-0070.flac,he spoke upon this topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance which is little
7780-274562-0071.flac, or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class of beings human once but now to humanity invisible
7780-274562-0072.flac,for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful more especially than for our own had been set in order by god the great landscape garden of the whole earth in the course of our discussion
7780-274562-0073.flac, to have well treated this theme there are properly he writes but two styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial
7780-274562-0074.flac, one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land
7780-274562-0075.flac,detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color which hid from the common observer or revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of a natural style of gardening
7780-274562-0076.flac, in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify
7780-274562-0077.flac,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english style
7780-274562-0078.flac, which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening
7780-274562-0079.flac, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral a terrace
7780-274562-0080.flac, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest
7780-274562-0081.flac,from what i have already observed said mister ellison you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country
7780-274562-0082.flac,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities
7780-274562-0083.flac, what is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much or little or nothing
7780-274562-0084.flac, that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles
7780-274562-0085.flac,is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius the merit suggested is at best negative
7780-274562-0086.flac, and appertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate addison into apotheosis in truth
7780-274562-0087.flac, appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes and flames in invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results
7780-274562-0088.flac, rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance to the virtues which deny or refrain beyond these the critical art can but suggest
7780-274562-0089.flac, we may be instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a tempest and inferno a prometious bound a nightingale
7780-274562-0090.flac,such as that of keats or the sensitive plant of shelly but the thing done
7780-274562-0091.flac,the sophists of the negative school who through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what
7780-274562-0092.flac,in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime
7780-274562-0093.flac, are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so
7780-274562-0094.flac,i repeat that the principle here expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested
7780-274562-0095.flac, yet which if attained will lend a charm to the landscape garden and measureably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow
7780-274562-0096.flac,so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in bringing about such result
7780-274562-0097.flac,he secures all the advantages of interests or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art
7780-274562-0098.flac,in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling
7780-274562-0099.flac, now if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness
7780-274562-0100.flac,definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity
7780-274562-0101.flac,then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god nor an emanation of god
7780-274562-0102.flac, in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this
7780-274562-0103.flac, in the free exercise in the open air which resulted from personal direction of his plans in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford
7780-274562-0104.flac, in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect and lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife
7780-274562-0105.flac,that ellison thought to find and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity
78-368-0000.flac,chapter twenty three it was eight o'clock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn
78-368-0001.flac,the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend
78-368-0002.flac,the clouds swept across its swifter than the flight of the vultures and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves
78-368-0003.flac, that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects
78-368-0004.flac, and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elisabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence
78-368-0005.flac,when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fiber was suspended
78-368-0006.flac, i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs the state lasted but for an instant
78-368-0007.flac, great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope
78-368-0008.flac,she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down in her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms in relaxed form
78-368-0009.flac, flung by the murderer on its bridal queer could i behold this and live alas life is obstinum and clings closest where it is most hated
78-368-0010.flac,but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them
78-368-0011.flac,to the room where lay the body of a Elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her
78-368-0012.flac, but the deadly langer and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elisabeth whom i had loved and cherished their murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck
78-368-0015.flac,but he eluded me leapt from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room
78-368-0016.flac, nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless
78-368-0017.flac,after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceed the short distance from the house
78-368-0018.flac, a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room
78-368-0019.flac, as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i rose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it
78-368-0020.flac, and join my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind
78-368-0021.flac, subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wondering horror the death of william the execution of jestine
78-368-0022.flac,the murder of claire val and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the theme
78-368-0023.flac,my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and earnest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action
78-368-0024.flac,there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents
78-368-0025.flac,however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night
78-368-0026.flac,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful and event is single in the history of man
78-368-0028.flac, know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted
78-368-0030.flac, misery on his gray hairs doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way
78-368-0031.flac, sometimes indeed i dreamt that i
78-368-0032.flac, mlellen called he followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released for my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation
78-368-0033.flac,the monster whom i had created the miserable demon who i had sent a broad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him
78-368-0034.flac, and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to reek a great
78-368-0035.flac, revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose
78-368-0036.flac, and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer
78-368-0037.flac,how ever wonderful force is conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood
78-368-0040.flac, and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested
78-368-0041.flac,when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power
78-368-0043.flac,i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance
78-368-0044.flac,who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude
78-368-0046.flac,and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the shamwa and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative
78-368-0047.flac,and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his dessert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he
78-368-0049.flac,have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impractical and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be
78-368-0050.flac,but all that i can say i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vise
78-368-0051.flac,my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just a man i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction
78-368-0052.flac, i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt thought of that haughty fierceness which the marters of old have said to have possessed
78-368-0053.flac,how ignorant are thou in thy pride of wisdom cease
78-369-0000.flac,chapter twenty four my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swout up and lost i was hurried away by fury
78-369-0001.flac, my first resolution was to quit jennyva forever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became painful
78-369-0002.flac,i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life
78-369-0003.flac, all the hard ships which travelers in deserts and barbarous countries i want to meet how i have lived i hardly know
78-369-0004.flac,and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dare not die and leave my adversary and being when i quitted jennyva my first labour
78-369-0005.flac, uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it
78-369-0006.flac,and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn
78-369-0007.flac, and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to fleet around
78-369-0008.flac,their murder also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth
78-369-0009.flac, on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by the o' night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the demon
78-369-0010.flac, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work
78-369-0011.flac, deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adoration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends
78-369-0012.flac, heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and raged choke my utterance
78-369-0013.flac, it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains reencoded and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter
78-369-0014.flac, and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a well known and a poor voice apparently close to my ear
78-369-0015.flac,i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards a spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp
78-369-0016.flac, suddenly the broad disc of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task
78-369-0017.flac, scared by this horrid apparition in front of me of his path sometimes he himself feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me
78-369-0018.flac,the snow's descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown
78-369-0019.flac, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sunk under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert
78-369-0020.flac, that restored and ensbirited me the fair was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate
78-369-0021.flac, and banish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the demon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected
78-369-0022.flac, i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy oh blessed sleep
78-369-0023.flac,often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfill my pilgrimage
78-369-0024.flac, during the day i was sustained and inspirated by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father
78-369-0025.flac, heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice and beheld clervil enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toil some march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come
78-369-0026.flac, and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonizing fondness did i feel for them
78-369-0027.flac, and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the demon more as a task in joined by heaven
78-369-0028.flac,as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious then as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were who might pursued i cannot know
78-369-0029.flac,these words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north
78-369-0030.flac,where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardly a dead hair
78-369-0031.flac, again do i vow vengeance again do i devote the miserable theme to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy
78-369-0032.flac,the peasants were shut up in their huffles and only a few of the most hearty ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice
78-369-0033.flac, and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off for my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labors
78-369-0034.flac,one inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toil is only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings
78-369-0035.flac,will satisfy my everlasting hatred my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words
78-369-0036.flac,and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervor to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon
78-369-0037.flac, oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness
78-369-0038.flac, the Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down
78-369-0039.flac, and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirits for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversary's job to meet and grabble with him
78-369-0040.flac, some weeks before this period i had procured a sled and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed
78-369-0041.flac,and i hope to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the sea shore i inquired of the inhabitants
78-369-0042.flac, concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage
78-369-0043.flac,through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs
78-369-0044.flac,he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers had pursued his journey across the scene a direction that led to no land and they conjectured
78-369-0045.flac,a mits cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure in which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant
78-369-0046.flac,my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hover ground and instigated me to toil and revenge
78-369-0047.flac,i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment
78-369-0048.flac, which threatened by destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
78-369-0049.flac, i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protection of hope returning back upon the heart often rung bitter drops of despondency and grief for my eyes
78-369-0050.flac, despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil
78-369-0051.flac, gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain
78-369-0052.flac,what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within
78-369-0053.flac, warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the demon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until
78-369-0054.flac, when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening craigsme indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey
78-369-0055.flac,my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before
78-369-0056.flac,as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes it tumultuousy rolled between me and my enemy
78-369-0057.flac,and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death
78-369-0058.flac,several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i sigh your vessel riding at anchor
78-369-0059.flac, i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship
78-369-0060.flac, but your direction was northward you took me on board when my vigor was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiple wide hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled
78-369-0061.flac, oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the demon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do
78-369-0062.flac, swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no
78-369-0063.flac, sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish
8095-274345-0000.flac,no sooner had charles taken into his hands the reigns of government than he showed and impatience to assemble the great council of the nation and he would gladly for the sake of despatch have called together the same parliament which had sit under his father
8095-274345-0001.flac,and which lay at that time under progrigation but being told that this measure would appear unusual he issued rites for summoning a new parliament on the 7th of may and it was not without regret that the arrival of the princess henrietta
8095-274345-0002.flac, unexperienced and impolitic regarded as sincere all the praises and caresses with which he had been loaded while active in procuring the rupture with the house of ostria and besides that he labored under great necessities
8095-274345-0003.flac,he lightly mentioned the occasion which he had for supply he employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of the members he would not even allow the officers of the crown who had seats in the house
8095-274345-0004.flac,and that great anticipations were likewise made on the revenues of the crown they were not ignorant the charles was loaded with a large debt contracted by his father who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from foreign princes
8095-274345-0005.flac,they had learned by experience that the public revenue could with difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown even under the ordinary charges of government
8095-274345-0006.flac,they were sensible that the present war was very lately the result of their own important applications and retreatees and that they had solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the management of it
8095-274345-0007.flac,they were acquainted with the difficulty of military enterprises directed against the whole house of austria against the king of spain possessed of the greatest riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in europe
8095-274345-0008.flac, against the emperor fernand hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age who had s'dude and astonished germany by the rapidity of his victories deep impressions they saw must be made by the english sword
8095-274345-0009.flac, and a vigorous offensive war be waged against these mighty potentates ere they would resign a principality which they had now fully subdued at which they held in secure possession by its being surrounded with all their other territories
8095-274345-0010.flac, to answer therefore all these great and important ends to satisfy their young king in the first request which he made them to prove their sense of the many royal virtues particularly economy with which charles was endowed
8095-274345-0011.flac,the house of commons conducted by the wisest and ableist senators that had ever flourished in england thought proper to confer on the king a supply of two subsidies
8095-274345-0012.flac, which the present conjuncture could suggest to them it is not to be doubted but spleen and ill will against the duke of bukingham had an influence with many so vast and rapid a fortune so little merited
8095-274345-0013.flac,could not fail to excite public envy and however men's hatred might have been suspended for a moment while the duke's conduct seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices it was impossible for him longed to preserve the affections of the people
8095-274345-0014.flac,his influence over the modesty of charles exceeded even that which he had acquired over the weakness of james nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel and direction
8095-274345-0015.flac,his vehement temper prompted him to raise suddenly to the highest elevation his flatterers and dependence and upon the least occasion of displeasure he threw them down with equal impetuousity and violence implacable in his hatred
8095-274345-0016.flac, fickle in his friendships all men were either regarded as his enemies or dreaded soon to become such the whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his insatiable hand while he both engrossed the entire confidence of his master
8095-274345-0017.flac, and held invested in his single person the most considerable offices of the crown however the ill humor of the commons might have been increased by these considerations we are not to suppose them the sole motives
8095-274345-0018.flac,the last parliament of james amidst all their joy and festivity had given him a supply very disproportion to his demand and to the occasion and as every house of commons which was elected during forty years
8095-274345-0019.flac, succeeded to all the passions and principles of their predecessors we ought rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the kingdom during that whole period than from any circumstances which attended this particular conjuncture
8095-274345-0020.flac,the nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of taxes and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting their sovereign even elizabeth notwithstanding her vigor and frugality
8095-274345-0021.flac, and the necessary war ahead in which she was engaged had reason to complain of the commons in this particular nor could the authority of that princess which was otherwise almost absolute ever extort from them the requisite supplies
8095-274345-0022.flac, would not augment their number in the same proportion the puritanical party though disguised had a great authority over the kingdom and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that sect
8095-274345-0023.flac,all these were disgusted with the court both by the prevalence and the principles of civil liberty essential to their party and on account of the restraint under which they were held but the established hierarchy
8095-274345-0024.flac,in order to fortify himself against the resentment of james bucking ham had affected popularity and entered into the cabal's of the puritons but being secure of the confidence of charles he had since abandoned this party
8095-274345-0025.flac, and on that account was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment though the religious schemes of many of the puritons when explained a pure pretty flervilous we are not dense to imagine that they were pursued by none but persons of weak understandings
8095-274345-0026.flac,the match with france and the articles in favor of catholics which were suspected to be in the treaty were likewise causes of disgust to this whole party
8095-274345-0027.flac,though it must be remarked that the connections with that crown were much less obnoxious to the protestants and less agreeable to the catholics than the alliance formerly projected to the spain and were therefore received rather with pleasure than to satisfaction
8095-274345-0028.flac,as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in prosecution of them among these we may mention the names of sir edward cope sir edwin sands sir robert phillips sir francis seymour
8095-274345-0029.flac, sir deadly digs sir john eliot sir thomas went worth mister seldom and mister pym animated with a warm regard to liberty
8095-274345-0030.flac, of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass though their ancestors had blindly given way to practises and precedents favorable to kingly power and had been able notwithstanding to preserve some small remains of liberty
8095-274345-0031.flac,it would be impossible they thought when all these pretensions were methodized and prosecuted by the increasing knowledge of the age to maintain any shadow of popular government in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign
8095-274345-0032.flac,it was necessary to fix a choice either to abandon entirely the privileges of the people or to secure them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitution had hitherto provided for them in this dilemma
8095-274345-0033.flac, men of such aspiring geniuses and such independent fortunes could not long deliberate they boldly embraced the side of freedom and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prince without extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty
8095-274345-0034.flac,the end they esteemed benificent and noble the means regular and constitutional to great or refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons and as all human governments particularly those of a mixed frame
8095-274345-0035.flac, are in continual fluctuation it was as natural in their opinion and allowable for popular assemblies to take advantage of favorable incidents in order to secure the subject
8095-274346-0000.flac, charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances he was however in his heart extremely adverse to these furious measures
8095-274346-0001.flac,though a determined protestant by principle as well as inclination he had entertained no violent horror against popery and a little humanity he thought was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors
8095-274346-0002.flac,and a batement of the more rigorous laws was all he intended and his engagements with france notwithstanding that their regular execution had never been promised or expected required of him some indulgence
8095-274346-0003.flac,but so unfortunate was this prince that no measure embraced during his whole reign was ever attended with more unhappy and more fatal consequences
8095-274346-0004.flac,the extreme rage against popery was a sure characteristic of puritanism the house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party
8095-274346-0005.flac,they petitioned the king for replacing such able clergy as had been silenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies they also enacted laws for the strict observance of sunday which the puritons affected to call the Sabbath
8095-274346-0006.flac,at which they sanctified by the most mellowing collie indolence it is to be remarked that the different appellations of this festival were at that time known symbols of the different parties
8095-274346-0007.flac,the king finding that the parliament was resolved to grant no supply and would furnish king with nothing but empty protestations of duty
8095-274346-0008.flac,was entrusted with the command was he sailed immediately for codis and found the bay full of spanish ships of great value he either neglected to attack these ships or attempted it preposterously
8095-274346-0009.flac,the army was landed and a fort taken but the undisciplined soldiers finding store of wine could not be restrained from the utmost successes further stay appearing fruitless they were reimbarked and the fleet put to see
8095-274346-0010.flac,with an intention of intercepting the spanish gallians but the plague having seized the seaman and soldiers they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this prize and returned to england loud complaints were made against the court for interesting so important a command
8095-274346-0011.flac, was obliged again to have recourse to a parliament though the ill success of his enterprises diminished his authority and showed every day more plainly the imprudence of the spanish war though the increase of his necessities
8095-274346-0012.flac, rendered him more dependent and more exposed to the encroachments of the commons he was resolved to try once more that regular and constitutional expedient for supply perhaps to a little political art which at that time he practised
8095-274346-0013.flac,was much trusted to he had named four popular leaders sheriffs of counties sir edward coke sir roberth was roberth phillips sir thomas went worth and sir francis seymour and though the question had been formerly much contested
8095-274346-0014.flac,he thought that he had by that means incapacitated them from being elected members but his intention being so evident rather put the commons more upon their guard
8095-274346-0015.flac,he now of patriots still remained to keep up the ill humour of the house and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recommend their practises
8095-274346-0016.flac,the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the occasion and ill fitted to promote those views of success and glory for which the young prince in his first enterprise so are late longed but this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one
8095-274346-0017.flac,the supply was only voted by the commons the passing of that vote into a law was reserved till the end of the session a condition was there by maid in a very undisguised manner with their sovereign
8095-274346-0018.flac,under a color of redressing grievances which during this short reign could not be very enumerous they were to proceed in regulating and controlling every part of government which displeased them
8095-274346-0019.flac,and if the king either cut them short in this undertaking or refused complolions with their demands he must not expect any supply from the commons great dissatisfaction was expressed by charles at a treatment which he deemed so harsh and undunful
8095-274346-0020.flac,but his urgent necessities obliged him to submit
8095-274346-0021.flac, had expressed all duty and obedience in expectation that an opportunity would offer of reinstating himself in his former credit in the authority even after charles's accession he despaired not
8095-274346-0022.flac,he submitted to the king's commands of remaining at his country seat and of absenting himself from parliament many trials he made to regain the good opinion of his master
8095-274346-0023.flac,but finding them all fruitless and observing charles to be entirely governed by buckingham his implacable enemy he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court a new spirit he saw and a new power arising in the nation
8095-274346-0024.flac,and in these he was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection when the parliament was summoned charles by a stretch of prerogative had given orders that no writ as his customary should be sent to bristle
8095-274346-0025.flac,that nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition and craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due as a peer of the realm his writ was sent him but accompanied with the letter from the lord keeper coventry
8095-274346-0026.flac, commanding him in the king's name to absent himself from parliament this letter ristalt conveyed to the lords and asked advice of how to proceed in some delogical situation
8095-274346-0027.flac,the king's prohibition was withdrawn and bristletook his seat provoked at these repeated instances of vigor which the court denominated contumacy charles ordered his attorney general to enter an accusation of high treason against him
8095-274346-0028.flac,by way of recrimination bristle accused buckingham of high treason both the urels defense of himself and accusation of the duke remain and together with some original letters still extant
8095-274346-0029.flac, of delivering ships to the french king in order to serve against the hewganats of being employed in the sale of honours and offices of accepting extensive grants from the crown of procuring many titles of honour for his kindred
8095-274346-0030.flac, and of administering physical to the late king without acquinting his physicians all these articles appear from comparing the accusation and reply to be either frivolous or false or both
8095-274346-0031.flac,the only charge which could be regarded as important was that he had extorted a sum of ten thousand pounds from the east india company and that he had confiscated some goods belonging to french merchants on pretence of there being the property of spanish
8095-274346-0032.flac,so that it is difficult for us to give a decisive opinion with regard to these articles
8095-274346-0033.flac,but so riveted throughout the nation were the prejudices with regard to spanish deceit and falsehood that very few of the commons seem as yet to have been convinced that they had been seduced by buckingham's narrative
8095-274346-0034.flac,a certain proof that a discovery of this nature was not as is imagined by several historians
8095-274346-0035.flac,the king seemed desirous of embracing every opportunity by which he could express it content and disregard for them no one was at that time sufficiently sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in the balance of the constitution
8095-274346-0036.flac,the history of england had never hitherto afforded one instance where any great movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower house and as their rank both considered in a body and his individuals was but the second in the kingdom
8095-274346-0037.flac,nothing less than fatal experience could engage the english princes to pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable assembly the earl of suffic chancelor of the university of cambridge dying about this time
8095-274346-0038.flac, buckingham though lying under impeachment was yet by means of court interest chosen in his place the commons resented and loudly complained of this affront and the more to enrage them the came himself wrote a letter to the university extolling the duke
8095-274346-0039.flac, yet lest any ambiguity should remain sir deadly carlton vise chamberland took care to explain it i pray you consider said he what these new councils are or may be i fear to declare those that i conceive
8095-274346-0040.flac,in all christian kingdoms you know that parliaments were in use anciently by which those kingdoms were governed in a most flourishing manner until the monarchs began to know their own strength and seeing the turbulent spirit of their parliaments at length
8095-274346-0041.flac,they by little and little began to stand on their prerogatives and at last overthrew the parliaments throughout christendom
8095-274346-0042.flac,which bringeth such happiness to this nation and makes us envy de vol others while there is this sweetness between his majesty and the commons lest we lose the repute of a free people by our turbulency in parliament
8095-274346-0043.flac, these imprudent suggestions rather gave warning than struck terror a precarious liberty the commons thought which was to be preserved by unlimited complacence was no liberty at all and it was necessary while yet in their power
8095-274346-0044.flac, to secure the constitution by such invincible barriers that no king or minister should ever for the future dare to speak such a language to any parliament or even entertain such a project against them
8095-274346-0045.flac,the commons immediately declared that they would proceed no further upon business till they had satisfaction in their privileges charles alleged as the reason of this measure certain saddicious expressions which he said had in their accusation of the duke
8095-274346-0046.flac, dropped from these members upon enquiry it appeared that no such expressions had been used the members were released and the king reaped no other benefit from this attempt than to exasperate the house still
8095-274346-0047.flac, and to show some degree of precipitancy and indiscretion moved by this example the house of piers were roused from their inactivity and claimed liberty for the earl of errone del who had been lately confined in the tower
8095-274346-0048.flac,after many fruitless evasions the king
8095-274346-0049.flac,his mother who had great influence over him was a professed catholic his wife was not free from suspicion
8095-274346-0050.flac,so violet was the bigotry of the times that it was thought a sufficient reason for disqualifying anyone from holding an office
8095-274346-0051.flac,this article together with the new impositions laid on merchandise by james constituted near half of the crown revenues and by depriving the king of these resources they would have reduced him to total subjection and dependence
8095-274346-0052.flac,while they retained such a plan and besides the supply already promised they were sure that nothing could be refused them though after canvassing the matter near three months they found themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke
8095-274346-0053.flac,the smallest appearance of guilt could not be fixed upon him what idea he asked must all mankind entertain of his honor should he sacrifice his innocent friend to peculiarity considerations what further authority should he retain in the nation
8095-274346-0054.flac, where he capable in the beginning of his reign to give in so signal and instance such matter of triumph to his enemies and discouragement to his adherents today the commons pretend to rest his minister from him
8095-274346-0055.flac, to morrow they will attack some branch of his prerogative by their remonstrances and promises and protestations they had engaged the crown in a war as soon as they saw a retreat impossible
8095-274346-0056.flac,without waiting for new incidents without covering themselves with new pretences they immediately deserted him and refused him all reasonable supplies it was evident that they desired nothing so much as to see him plunged in inextricable difficulties
8095-274346-0057.flac,of which they intended to take advantage to such deep perfety to such unbounded usurpations it was necessary to oppose a proper firmness and resolution
8095-274348-0000.flac, and who from a private station had mounted in the earliest youth
8095-274348-0001.flac,he dared to carry his ambitious addresses to the queen herself and he failed not to make impression on a heart not undisposed to the tender passions that attachment at least of the mind which appears so delicious and is so dangerous
8095-274348-0002.flac, scenes to have been encouraged by the princess and the dew presumed so far on her good graces that after his departure he secretly returned upon some pretence and paying a visit to the queen
8095-274348-0003.flac,was dismissed with a reproof which savored more of kindness than of anger information of this correspondence was soon carried to ricia the vigilance of that minister was here further roused by jealousy
8095-274348-0004.flac,he too either from vanity or politic or politics had ventured to pay his addresses to the queen but a priest passed middle age of a severe character and occupied in the most extensive plans of ambition or vengeance
8095-274348-0005.flac, entirely disposed to gayety and gallantry the cardinal's disappointment strongly inclined him to counter work the amorous projects of his rival when the duke was making preparations for a new embassy to paris
8095-274348-0006.flac, a message was sent him from louis that he must not think of such a journey in a romantic passion he swore that he would see the queen in spite of all the power of france
8095-274348-0007.flac,and from that moment he determined to engage england and awar with that kingdom he first took advantage of some quarrels excited by the queen of england's attendance and he persuaded charles to dismiss at once all her french servants
8095-274348-0008.flac, contrary to the articles of the marriage treaty he encouraged the english ships of war and privateers to seize vessels belonging to french merchants
8095-274348-0009.flac, and strongly solicited charles to embrace the protection of these distressed religionists he represented that after the inhabitants of rochelle had been repressed by the combined squadrants of england and holland
8095-274348-0010.flac,after peace was concluded with the french king under charles's mediation the ambitious cardinal was still meditating the destruction of the eugenots that preparations were silently making in every province of france for the suppression of their religion
8095-274348-0011.flac,that forts were erected in order to bridal reshell the most considerable bulwark of the protestant that the reformed in france cast their eyes on charles as the head of their faith
8095-274348-0012.flac, and considered him as a prince engaged by interest as well as inclination to support them that so long as their party subsisted trials might rely on their attachment as much as on that of his own subjects but if their liberties were once ravished from them
8095-274348-0013.flac,the power of france freed from this impediment would soon become formidable to england and to all the neighbouring nations though charles probably bore but small favor to heugunats who so much resembled the puritans in discipline and worship
8095-274348-0014.flac, in religion and politics he yet allowed himself to be gained by these arguments enforced by the solicitations of bukingham a fleet of a hundred sail and an army of seven thousand men were fitted out for the invasion of france
8095-274348-0015.flac,and both of them entrusted to the command of the duke who was altogether unacquainted both with land and sea service the fleet appeared before rochelle but so ill conserted were bucking ham's measures that the inhabitants of that city
8095-274348-0016.flac, shut their gates and refused to admit allies of whose coming they were not previously informed
8095-274348-0017.flac, hastened the vengeance of their master exhausted their provisions in supplying their allies and were threatened with an immediate siege
8098-275181-0000.flac,their sharp curr like barks used often to rouse us and of a dark evening we would hear the mountain of the fields mousing around the stone heaps making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse
8098-275181-0001.flac, to call the real mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps this indeed is a favorite trick of rendered at the time of my story my friend tom edward's ten years of age
8098-275181-0002.flac,and myself and myself were in the turkey business equal partners we owned a flock of thirty one turkeys these roosted by night in a large butternutry in front of tom's house in the very top of it
8098-275181-0003.flac, and by day they wondered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beach nuts which were very plentiful that fall all went well till the last week in october when on taking the senses one morning a turkey was found to be missing
8098-275181-0004.flac,the thirty one had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening it was the first one we had lost we proceeded to look for traces our suspicions were divided
8098-275181-0005.flac, tom thought it was the twomply boys nefarious sam in particular i thought it might have been an owl but under the tree and the soft dirt were the potatoes had recently been dug we found fox tracks
8098-275181-0006.flac,and two or three ominous little wods of feathers with one long tail feather adrift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butternut at a fit perhaps
8098-275181-0007.flac, and a casualty such as turkey raisers are unavoidably heirs to and we bore our laws with resignation we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roofs
8098-275181-0008.flac, this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only twenty nine the next morning there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter
8098-275181-0009.flac, no algerber was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate together with our prospective prophets in the light of this new fact it was clear that something must be done and at once too
8098-275181-0010.flac,or ruin would swallow up the paltry firm rightly or wrongly we attributed the mischief to a certain silver grey that had several times been seen in the neighbourhood that autumn
8098-275181-0011.flac,it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks i recollect that we said three traps for him to no purpose
8098-275181-0012.flac, had succeeded in getting two more of the turkeys heroes it is said are born of great crises this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius i'll have that fox he said when the traps failed
8098-275181-0013.flac,each a wide of fine dry grass as large as a court box these were gathered up and filled the great basket there said he triumphantly don't them smell mousey they did certainly
8098-275181-0014.flac, they savored as strongly of mice as tom's question of bad grammar and don't foxes catch mice demanded tom confidently yes but i don't see how that's going to catch a fox i said
8098-275181-0015.flac, well look here then i'll show you said he
8098-275181-0016.flac,and you was prowling round the fields go off now out there by that stump full of wonder and curiosity i retired to the stump tom meanwhile turned out the mass of nests
8098-275181-0017.flac, and with it completely covered himself the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest or rather a small haycock
8098-275181-0018.flac,inside the nest evidently there were mice in it and feeling my character as fox at stake i at once tried it forward then crept up and as the rustling and squeaking continued made a pounce into the grass
8098-275181-0019.flac,as i heard it said their foxes did when mousing instantly two spry brown hands from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip as a fox i struggled tremendously
8098-275181-0020.flac,then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone do you see now he demanded i saw but a fox would bite you i objected let him bite said tom
8098-275181-0021.flac,with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stone heaps were and where we had often asked hurried fox's bark selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump
8098-275181-0022.flac, tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contents of the big basket he then practised squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim his squeaks were perfect successes
8098-275181-0023.flac,made by sucking the air sharply mainly between his teeth no be off said tom and come poking around nor get in sight till you hear me holler
8098-275181-0024.flac, and being amidst nice cosy straw i presently went to sleep quite unintentionally i must have slept some time though it seemed to me but a very few minutes what woke me was a noise a sharp suppressed yelp
8098-275181-0025.flac, it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there a sound of scoffling and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field
8098-275181-0026.flac,as i ran two or three dull wax came to my ear got him tom i shouted rushing up tom was holding and squeezing one of his hands with the other and shaking it violently
8098-275181-0027.flac,he said not a word but left me to poke about and stumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near by tea i exclaimed after satisfying myself that the fox was dead some said tom
8098-275181-0028.flac,and that was all i could get from him that night we took the fox to the house and laid it a candle it was the silver gray tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed
8098-275181-0029.flac,his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow several minor nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab
8098-275181-0030.flac,these numerous bites however were followed by no serious ill effects the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass that he had caught hold of one of its hind legs
8098-275181-0031.flac, i just determined to have it out with him considering the fact that a fox is a very active sharp biting animal and that this was an unusually large male i have always thought tom got off very well

8098-278278-0014.flac,the ladies looked at the dog and then at pod not knowing which to think then feeling sensitive about accepting the best part of the stake insisted upon pods having one of their pieces and coonskin the other

8098-278278-0019.flac, coonskin's opinion didn't benefit pa'd much his heart would fire wasn't very satisfactory but with some dry brush the man got the meal under way next morning we visited the noted petrified stump
8098-278278-0020.flac,measuring upwards of forty five feet in sir comforts several saws were embedded in it for many futile attempts have been made to take off some slices for the denver exposition
8098-278278-0021.flac,it has been estimated by various ornithologists bought nists and entomologists at the stump as millions of years old i think they were guessing at it for i couldn't see the rings
8098-278278-0022.flac, several times i had a suspicion that we had been misdirected when we came to the end of a narrow wood road i was sure of it
8098-278278-0023.flac, b asked to go through the woods said the valet so we were headed for the timber our tramp through the forest i cannot soon forget up and down the rocky heights through thickets of quaking asp and pine
8098-278278-0024.flac,and realized we were lost kounskin said he was an experienced woodsman and would blaze the trees so we would get out again wonderful the amount of learning he had gleaned from dying novels
8098-278278-0025.flac,he lagged behind to do the blazing and pretty soon i smelt smoke the professor's snuffed the professor's snuffed smells as if the woods were on fire somewhere hinted potted look behind you they are i exclaimed
8098-278278-0026.flac, and pa had caught that erudite valet back wood's men in the act of setting a tree on fire with oil and matches fortunately for us the wind wasn't blowing strong

8098-278278-0028.flac,a board sign informed us it was simply turkey creak i couldn't see any turkeys but there was good passage orage around the hot trip through the timber made us all hungry
8098-278278-0029.flac,it was three o'clock when weed donks were picketed and allowed to graze then coonskin went fishing he said he had seen some trout in the stream by supper time he had caught a nice mess
8098-278278-0030.flac,pod said he would fry the fish and went at it so enthusiastically that he forgot to put the bag of corn meal back in its place after the meal was over he began to look around for the bag it was nowhere to be found
8098-278278-0031.flac, i had eaten the cornstarch or meal and bag it was comical how those two men puzzled their brains about that missing commodity when coonskin detected some meal stamped in the ground pod pointed at me and said
8098-278278-0032.flac,that's the thief there next morning coonskin was the first to return from thishing and looked much excited when pot returned he told him he had seen huge bear tracks he was going bear hunting pot laughed at him
8098-278278-0033.flac,that was my experience in the woods of wisconsin the minute the saw mill said we should see bear in this forest
8098-278278-0034.flac, its skin would fetch fifty dollars or more let's look for bear what would you do if you saw a bear pot asked well now leave that to me said coonskin
8098-278278-0035.flac, in the first place it would be worth a hair's breath escape to see one wild i've only seen bears and circuses or traveling chain to italians in the second place i can run i've plenty of medals for sprinting
8098-278278-0036.flac,pod went fishing that afternoon with a gun and took the whole arsenal along with him including the eggs somewhere about five o'clock pod came into camp with a good mess of trout after cleaning the fish he took off his guns
8098-278278-0037.flac, and lay down on the grass and wondered if that crazy valet had run across any more bear tracks he wasn't there long when suddenly i heard yells issuing from the canion downstream round the bend
8098-278278-0038.flac, the shouting sounded nearer every second and i soon distinguished coonskin's voice poth'd got up from the ground excitedly coonskin's in trouble plain enough said poth aloud to himself i must run to his aid
8098-278278-0039.flac, so he started on a trot downstream to the bend and then quickly turned falling all over himself and ran toward the cabins faster than i ever saw him run before or since
8098-278278-0040.flac, an immediately coonskin came flying into view with the biggest bear at his heels i ever want to see
8238-274553-0000.flac,i'll have none of them ned nobles the baron rittsner van jean was a noble hungarian family every member of which at least a spar back into antiquity as any certain records extend
8238-274553-0001.flac,was more or less remarkable for talent of some description the majority for that species of grotesquery in conception of which teak a sign of the house has given a vivid
8238-274553-0002.flac, threw a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental confirmation in later days this insight grew more clear
8238-274553-0003.flac, which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty fifth of june i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world
8238-274553-0004.flac,no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniqueity consisted
8238-274553-0005.flac,but letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits
8238-274553-0006.flac, manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him and influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable
8238-274553-0007.flac, that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron riz nerve an young then of no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guest respecting his age by any data personally afforded
8238-274553-0008.flac,he might have been fifteen or fifty
8238-274553-0009.flac,he was by no means a handsome man and perhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub
8238-274553-0010.flac,after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features can bang so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity
8238-274553-0011.flac, solemnity and repose it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification
8238-274553-0012.flac,the study and the business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue
8238-274553-0013.flac,i quaintly termed the domination of the baron riz nirvana young ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself
8238-274553-0014.flac,ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practical the old bulldog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused the ghost of heraclitus or the wig of the ameritus professor of theology
8238-274553-0015.flac,this too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks wins a calatise and buffoonaries were brought about if not directly by him
8238-274553-0016.flac, lay in that consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self possession
8238-274553-0017.flac, in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of all mimiter
8238-274553-0018.flac,which upon each such failure of his praise were the endeavours would suffuse every lineaments of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most sceptical companions
8238-274553-0019.flac,the adrightness too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created
8238-274553-0020.flac,from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no instance before that of which i speak hav'i known the habitual mystific escape
8238-274553-0021.flac,my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household
8238-274553-0022.flac, with the memory of the baron rizner van jean
8238-274553-0023.flac, lay like an inkibus upon the university
8238-274553-0024.flac,during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all in grossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening
8238-274553-0025.flac,and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor and eloquence
8238-274553-0026.flac,in impressiveness and in affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his heroes in general and absolutely staggered even myself who well knew him to be at heart
8238-274553-0027.flac, a ridicular of those very points for which he contented and especially to hold the entire fanfarin aid of dueling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves
8238-274553-0028.flac, looking around me during a pause in the baron's discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of cold ridge
8238-274553-0029.flac,except perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking
8238-274553-0030.flac,and i believe for some logical talent as a duelist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly
8238-274553-0031.flac,but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the dweller and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he rode to the death to ritzner
8238-274553-0032.flac,ever upon the look out for the grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time passed afforded food for mystification of this however i was not aware
8238-274553-0033.flac,i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing as lengthy spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r and giving his reasons in detail
8238-274553-0034.flac,to these the baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer
8238-274553-0035.flac, your opinions allow me to say baron vanyang although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member
8238-274553-0036.flac, i would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman as herman completed this equifical sentence all eyes returned upon the baron
8238-274553-0037.flac, then excessively red then dropping his pocket handkerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no one else at the table
8238-274553-0038.flac,it was radiant with the physical expression which was its natural character but which i had never seen it as soon except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood erect
8238-274553-0039.flac,for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that he was in silver earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadavrously white
8238-274553-0040.flac,for a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched
8238-274553-0041.flac,the language you have thought proper to employ
8238-274553-0042.flac,in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specific occasion that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman
8238-274553-0043.flac, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct
8238-274553-0044.flac,you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to consider for an instant
8238-274553-0045.flac,this being done there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mere and thus fulfill all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult
8238-274553-0046.flac,while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be abvated with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite herman
8238-274553-0047.flac, striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments though company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and rizner took their departure
8238-274553-0048.flac, as herman went out the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business
8238-274553-0049.flac,and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly forebare laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profound discravity what he termed a refinedly peculiar character
8238-274553-0050.flac,after a tire some harang in his ordinary style he took down from his bookshelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duet lo and entertained me for a long time
8238-274553-0051.flac,the theatre of honour by favin

8238-274553-0053.flac,with a fine margin and bound by derome
8238-274553-0054.flac,and having the quaint title duetle le xcripter et non
8238-274553-0055.flac,from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world
8238-274553-0056.flac, per construction m
8238-274553-0057.flac, although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling
8238-274553-0058.flac,we'll hand you this note i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience and explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers in the event of your declining this request
8238-274553-0059.flac, having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which i carried to herman sir through our common friend at mister p i have received your note of this evening
8238-274553-0060.flac,upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disc agreement
8238-274553-0061.flac, i have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette
8238-274553-0062.flac,the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient i am assured
8238-274553-0063.flac,to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation with sentiments of profound respect your most obedient servant vanyung
8238-274553-0064.flac,herman commenced the perusal of despissal with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self complacency
8238-274553-0065.flac, at per se having finished reading he begged to read with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself
8238-274553-0066.flac, to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron
8238-274553-0067.flac,he seemed to receive herman's amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duetley lectorceptoret non
8238-274553-0068.flac,he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my surprise
8238-274553-0069.flac,he now explained the mystery
8238-274553-0070.flac,and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately
8238-274553-0071.flac,where there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in hermit's way
8238-274553-0072.flac, two or three weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation
8238-274553-0073.flac,hen firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit upon this hint he proceeded
8238-274553-0074.flac,herman would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duet wello
8238-283452-0000.flac, introduction the humorous ghost is distinctly a modern character in early literature rathes took themselves very seriously
8238-283452-0001.flac,and insisted on a proper show of respectful fear on the part of those whom they honoured by haunting a mortal was expected to rise when a ghost entered the room and in case he was slow about it
8238-283452-0002.flac,his spine gave notice of what etiquette demanded in the event of outdoor apparition if a man failed to bear his head in all the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness
8238-283452-0003.flac,in that her locks being long and pinned up are less easily moved which may explain the fact if it be a fact that infixion women have shown themselves more self possessed
8238-283452-0004.flac,while the feminine can be seen through by another woman and thus disarmed the majority of the comic apparitions curiously enough are masculine you don't often find women rathed in smiles
8238-283452-0005.flac, and have shivered rustley spared the gentler shades and there are very few funny child ghosts you might almost say none in comparison with the number of grown ups
8238-283452-0006.flac,the number of ghost children of any or all types is small proportionately perhaps because it seems an unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances
8238-283452-0007.flac,there are a few instances as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later but very few ancient ghosts were a long faced lot
8238-283452-0008.flac, since any living person however senile would be thought juvenile compared with a timeless spook but in these days of individualism and radical liberalism spooks as well as mortals are expanding their personalities
8238-283452-0009.flac, and indulging in greater freedom a ghost can call his shade his own now and exhibit any mood he pleases even young female race demanding latch keys refused to obey the frowning face of the clock
8238-283452-0010.flac, to make the ghosts of missus grundy turn a shade paler and horror now a day as haunters have more fun and freedom than the haunted in fact its money in one's pocket these days to be dead for ghosts have no rent problems
8238-283452-0011.flac, manifestly death has conversations not connected with the consolations of religion the marvel is that apparitions were so long in realizing their possibilities in improving their advantages
8238-283452-0012.flac,the specters in classic and medieval literature were milarial vaporous beings without energy to do anything but threatened
8238-283452-0013.flac,at best a rev'n a could only rattle a rusty skeleton or shake a moldy shroud or clenke a chain but as mortals coward before his demonstrations he didn't worry
8238-283452-0014.flac,the up to date ghost keeps his skeleton in a garage or some place where it is cleaned and oiled and kept in good working order the modern rath has sold his sheet to the old clothesman and dresses as in life
8238-283452-0015.flac,he knows that there is no weapon no threat in horror to be compared with ridicule think what a solemn creature that gothic ghost was
8238-283452-0016.flac,how little originality and initiative he showed and how dependent he was on his own atmosphere for thrills his soul appeal was to the spinal column the ghost of today touches the funny bone as well
8238-283452-0017.flac, many americans there are to day who had court being haunted by the captain and crew of richard middle scotish ship that landed in a turnip field and dispensed drink till they demoralized the denizens of village and graveyard alike
8238-283452-0018.flac,after that show of spirits the turnips in that field tasted of rum long after the ghosts sailed away into the blue the modern spook is possessed not only of humor but of a caustic satire as well
8238-283452-0019.flac,his jest is likely to have more than one point to it and he can haunt so insidiously can make himself so at home in his host's study or bedroom that a man actually welcomes a chat with him
8238-283452-0020.flac,a ghost moreover that towered and swelled at every hackneyed phrase till finally he filled the room and burst after the young man proposed to his admired one and made subsequent remarks
8238-283452-0021.flac,ghosts not only have appallingly long memories but they possess a mean advantage over the living in that they have once been mortal
8238-283452-0022.flac,the modern humorous ghost satirizes everything from the old fashioned specter he's very fond of taking pot shot at him to the latest psychic manifestations
8238-283452-0023.flac,he laughed at ghosts that aren't experts in efficiency haunting and he has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of specters he loves to shake the ludg furious terrors of the past before you
8238-283452-0024.flac, and uses the old thrills only to show what dead batteries they come from his really electrical effects are his own inventions he needs no dungeon keeps and monkish sells to play about in not he
8238-283452-0025.flac,he demands no rag nor bone nor clank of chain of his old equipment to start on his career he can start up a moving picture show of his own as in ruth mccanney's stewards the haunted photograph
8238-283452-0026.flac, and demonstrate a new kind of apparition the ghost story of to day gives you spinal sensations with a difference as in the immortal transferred ghost by fredar stockton
8238-283452-0027.flac, where the suitor on the moonlit porch attempting to tell his fair one that he doats on her sees the ghost of her ferocious uncle who isn't dead
8238-283452-0028.flac, kicking his heels against the railing and hears his admonition that he'd better hurry up as the live uncle is coming in sight
8238-283452-0029.flac, has never been a ghost nor used a wooden leg but its terrifying leg a sea while you do believe in it the new ghost has a more nimble and versatile tongue as well as wit
8238-283452-0030.flac,in the older fiction and drama apparitions spoke seldom
8238-283452-0031.flac,and ghosts like kings and drama were of a dignity and must preserve it in their speech or perhaps the authors were doubtful as to the dialogue of sheds
8238-283452-0032.flac, and compromised on a few stately ejaculations as being safely phantasmal speaking parts but compare that usage with the rude freedom of some modern spooks
8238-283452-0033.flac,think of having always and always to speak a dead language the humerus ghost is not only modern but he is distinctively american there are ghosts of all nationalities naturally
8238-283452-0034.flac,but the spook that provides joke on his host or on himself is a yankee in origin and development that dry humour the comic sense of the incongruous the willingness to laugh at himself as at others
8238-283452-0035.flac,and are preserved in their true flavor i don't assert of course
8238-283452-0036.flac,the french and english selections in this volume are sufficient to prove the contrary
8238-283452-0037.flac, there are various english stories of whimsical haunting some of actual spooks and some of the hoax types hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in british as in american literature
8238-283452-0038.flac,of the early subacimans of the really amusing ghost that is an actual revenal is the ghost baby in blackwoods which shows originality and humor yet is too diffuse for printing here
8238-283452-0039.flac,in that we have a conventional young bachelor engaged to a charming girl who is entangled in social complications and made to suffer mental torment because without his consent
8238-283452-0040.flac, till the phantom couple take a liking to each other and decide to let the living weary their dead this is suggestive of brand or matthews earlier and clever story of a spectral courtship in the rival ghosts
8238-283452-0041.flac, Medieval and later literature give us many instances of love affair or marriage between one spirit and one mortal
8238-283452-0042.flac,shall the diversity of the english humour as associated with apparitions and are entertaining in themselves the canterville ghost by oscar wild is one of his best short stories
8238-283452-0043.flac, this travesty on the conventional traditions of the rake is preposterously delightful one of the cleverest ghost stories in our language zang well has written engagingly of spooks
8238-283452-0044.flac, frank our stock didn gave his to funny spooks with a riotous and laughing pen the spirit in the transferred ghost is impudently deathless and has called up a train of subsequent haunters
8238-283452-0045.flac, john kendrick banks has made the darker regions seem comfortable and home like for us and has created ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward to being one or more
8238-283452-0046.flac, we feel downright neighborly toward such specters as the futile last ghost nelson loy de vokes for us as we appreciate the satire of roso nil's sophisticated race
8238-283452-0047.flac,the field is still comparatively limited but a number of americans have done distinctive work in it the specter now wears matley instead of a shroud
831-130739-0000.flac,the principal character in the story if you presuming you are of the sex that does such things if you had gone into the drapery in porriome which is really only magnificent for shop
831-130739-0001.flac, a perfectly fictitious co by the by of putney on the fourth of august eighteen ninety five had turned to the right hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend
831-130739-0002.flac,you might have been served by the central figure of this story that is now beginning he would have come forward bowing and swaying
831-130739-0003.flac,what he might have the pleasure of showing you under certain circumstances as for instance hats baby linen gloves silks lace or curtains
831-130739-0004.flac, and making a kind of circular sweep invited you to step this way and so led you behind his can
831-130739-0005.flac, huckaback blankets dimety cratone linen calico are cases in point
831-130739-0006.flac,under which happier circumstances you might if of an observing turn of mind and not too much of a housewife to be in human have given the central figure of this story less cursory attention
831-130739-0007.flac,now if you had noticed anything about him it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable he were the black morning coat the black tie and the speckled gray nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft
831-130739-0008.flac,haired of a kind of dirty fairness grayish eyes and a skimpy immature mustache under his peaked indeterminant nose his features were all small but none ill shaped a rosette of pins decorated the lubell of his coat
831-130739-0009.flac,we could show you something better of course no trouble madam i assure you such were the simple counters of his intercourse so i say
831-130739-0010.flac,he would have danced a boat behind the counter have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you have put on one side those you selected extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tinfoil sheet from a fixture
831-130739-0011.flac, made you owe the little bill in that weak flourishing hand peculiar to draper's
831-130739-0012.flac, sign then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view
831-130739-0013.flac,have scribbled still more flourishing j m all over the document have asked you if there was nothing more have stood by you supposing that you were paying cash until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change
831-130739-0014.flac, one glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilties at work all about you
831-130739-0015.flac,but real literature as distinguished from anecdot does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone literature is revelation modern literature is indecorious revelation
831-130739-0016.flac,it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen even at the cost of some blushes and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story
831-130739-0017.flac,the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was let us face it bravely the remarkable condition of this young man's legs let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness
831-130739-0018.flac,let us assume something of the scientific spirit that heard almost professional tone of the conscientious realist let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest where the unemotional
831-130739-0019.flac,and so to our revelation on the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed ladies and gentlemen a contusion and an abrasion on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contusion also
831-130739-0020.flac,on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise on his left chin there were two bruises one a lead in yellow graduating here and there into purple and another obviously of a more recent date of a blotchy red
831-130739-0021.flac,tumid and threatening proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner an unnatural hardness and reddish would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf
831-130739-0022.flac,and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points
831-130739-0023.flac,the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee so far we may proceed with our details
831-130739-0024.flac, fired by these discoveries and investigator might perhaps have presumed his enquiries further to bruises on the shoulders elbows and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story
831-130739-0025.flac,he had indeed been bumped and battered at an extraordinary number of points but enough of realistic description is as good as a feast
831-130739-0026.flac,even in literature one must know where to draw the line now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shotman
831-130739-0027.flac,one might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a thrushing machine say or one of those haymaking furries but sherlock homes
831-130739-0028.flac, would have fancied nothing of the kind
831-130739-0029.flac,considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner upon the bicycle saddle and that the ruined estate of the right knee was equally eloquent
831-130739-0030.flac, of the concussions attended on that person's hasty frequently causeless and invariably ill conceived descent's one large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist
831-130739-0031.flac, for upon every one of them wets the jest of the unexpected treddle you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and a whack you are rubbing your shin so out of innocence we ripen
831-130739-0032.flac, two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in learning such as one to might expect in a person unused to muscular exercise blister's on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering rider and so forth
831-130739-0033.flac,until sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine written is an old fashioned affair with a fork instead of a diamond frame a cushion tire well worn on the hind wheel
831-130739-0034.flac,rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from rohampton to puttany hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel
831-130739-0035.flac, a gasping a grunting a shouting of steer man steer a wavering unsteady flight a spasmatic turning of the missal edifice of man in machine and a collapse then you describe dimly through the dusk
831-130739-0036.flac,thus even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself and drive him against all the conditions of his calling against the counsels of prudence and the restrictions of his means
831-130739-0037.flac,to seek the wholesome delight of exertion and danger and pain and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man to which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end
831-130739-0038.flac, but enough of these revelations the central fear of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be backed by the senior reporter and sent to you
831-130739-0039.flac, and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins to straighten them punctiliously and near him is an apprentice to the same high calling of draper's assistant
831-130739-0040.flac,a ruddy red haired lad in a very short tailless black coat and a very high collar who is deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of creton
831-130739-0041.flac,the assistant is dreaming of the delicious time only four hours off now when he will resume the tale of his bruises and abrasions the princess is nearer the long long thoughts of boyhood and his imagination writes cup a pie
831-130739-0042.flac,threw the chambers of his brain seeking some nightly quest in honor of that fair lady the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dress making upstairs
831-130739-0043.flac,he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
831-130739-0044.flac, they're going fairly well sir
831-130739-0045.flac, the shop walker brings up a parallel to the counter any particular time when you want your holidays he asks hoop driver pulls at his skimpy moustache no don't want them too late sir of course
831-130739-0046.flac, how about this day week hoop driver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the corners of his gongom folds in his hands his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations can he learn to did a week that's the question
831-130739-0047.flac, otherwise brig's will get next week and he will have to wait until september when the weather is often uncertain he is naturally of a sanguine disposition
831-130739-0048.flac,all draper's have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you the decision comes at last
831-130739-0049.flac,the next in the strict scale of precedence of the drapery imporanum mister hoop drive in alternating spasms anon straightens his gangome and anon becomes meditative with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom tooth
831-130739-0050.flac,at supper that night holiday talk held undisputed sway mister pritchard spoke of scotland miss isok's clamored about
831-130739-0051.flac, i said hoop driver when the question came to him why cycling of course you're never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours day after day said miss how of the costume department i am
831-130739-0052.flac, said hoop driver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient moustache
831-130739-0053.flac,you stow it said mister hoop driver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt
831-130739-0054.flac, i'm getting fairly safe upon it now he told miss how at other times hoop driver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity
831-130739-0055.flac,when the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and a very big place and studying a road map of the south of england
831-130739-0056.flac,was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark brig's had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt whoopdrivers inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him have the machine thoroughly well oiled said brig's
831-130739-0057.flac, carry one or two lemons with you don't tear yourself to death the first day and sit upright never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity you mind those things and nothing very much can't happen to you whoop driver you take my word
831-130739-0058.flac, save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe and then break out with an entirely different set of tips avoid running over dogs who driver whatever you do
831-130739-0059.flac,never let the machine buckle though as a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling don't scorch don't ride on the footpath keep your own side of the road and if you see a tram line go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county
831-130739-0060.flac,and always laid up before dark you mind just a few little things like that hoop driver and nothing much can't happen to you you take my word right you are said hoop driver good night old man good night said brig's
831-130739-0061.flac,oop driver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it never oil the steering it's fatal
831-130739-0062.flac, a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying and clean the chain daily with black lead you mine just a few little things like that
831-130746-0000.flac,the ostler being a fool rushed violently down the road vociferating after them then he returned panting to the vicarna hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up stopped to give them the cream of the adventure
831-130746-0001.flac,that gave the fugitives five minutes then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the bar maid what the matter was and the governor being out they spent some more precious time wondering whatever was to be done
831-130746-0002.flac, there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse that made ten minutes
831-130746-0003.flac,then steven the waiter who had shown hoop driver up came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question which that turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour and in the midst of this discussion
831-130746-0004.flac, making a sudden and ostric in silence appeared beckumail in hall beyond the bar walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and passed out of sight you can see for the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium
831-130746-0005.flac, incredulous eyes stared into one another's in the bar as his paces muffled by the stare carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead
831-130746-0006.flac,it wasn't that one at all miss said the osler i'd swear well that's mister baulwant said the bar maid anyhow their conversation hung comatose in the air switched up by beckumoe
831-130746-0007.flac,they listened together his feet stomped turned went out of the dining room down the passage to the bedroom stopped again poor chap said the bar maid she's a wicked woman shh said steven
831-130746-0008.flac,after a pause beckuml went back to the dining room they heard a chair creak under him interlude of conversational eyebrows i'm going up said steepen to break the mill and call the news to him beckuml looked up from a weak old newspaper
831-130746-0009.flac,as without knocking steven entered beckomel's face suggested a different expectation big pardon sir said steven with a diplomatic cough well said beckomel wondering suddenly if jessie had kept some of her threats
831-130746-0010.flac,if so he was in for next explanation but he had it ready she was a monomaniake leave me alone with her he would say i know how to calm her missus bowmont said steven well has gone
831-130746-0011.flac,he rose with a fine surprise gone he said with a half laugh gone sir on her bicycle on her bicycle why she went sir with another gentleman this time buckmeow was really startled
831-130746-0012.flac, another gentleman who another gentleman in brown sir went into the yard sir got out the two bicycles sir and went off sir about twenty minutes ago beckonel stood with his eyes round and his knuckles on his hips
831-130746-0013.flac,but as yet he seemed merely stunned brown clothes he said and ferish a little like yourself sir in the dark the awesleur sir gym duke
831-130746-0014.flac,then with infinite fervor he said but let us put in blank cartridge he said i might have thought he flung himself into the arm chair damn her said beckomill for all the world like a common man
831-130746-0015.flac, i'll chuck this in fernel business they've gone eh yes sir yes sir yes sir
831-130746-0016.flac, making a memorable saying let him go who cares and i wish him luck and bring me some bourbon as fast as you can there is a good job
831-130746-0017.flac, steven was too surprised to say anything but berbin sir go on said beckmill damn you steven sympathise changed it once yes sir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marvelling
831-130746-0018.flac,she had evidently gone off with him and that little business was over and he was here stranded and sold
831-130746-0019.flac,and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all that the girl had escaped through her stepmother in which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed
831-130746-0020.flac, knicker bockers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its steps
831-130746-0021.flac,he banged the arms of the chair with his fists and swore again
831-130746-0022.flac, i beckuml when with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door steven entered with the bourbon
831-130746-0023.flac,the moonlight ride and so the twenty minutes law passed into an infinody
831-130746-0024.flac,the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vicarna hotel we leave all bognor as we have left all chinchester
831-130746-0025.flac,and midhurst and hasil mir and guild vert and ripply and putney and follow this dear fool of a hoopsriver of ours and his young laden gray out upon the moonlit road how they rode
831-130746-0026.flac,how their heart speeded together and their breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursued for all that flight mister hoop driver was in the world of a romance had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit
831-130746-0027.flac, hubdriver had cut him down and written on after the fashion of a hero born had beckmell arisen in the way with wrap years for a duel hubdriver had fought as one to whom adjan court was a reality and drapery of dream
831-130746-0028.flac,it was rescue allopment glory and she by the side of him he had seen her face in shadow
831-130746-0029.flac,he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears but what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon the road turned northward going round through the outskirts of bognor
831-130746-0030.flac,then admits vela's again some warm and lamp lit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw broad wands meadows shrouded in a low lying mist
831-130746-0031.flac,they scarcely heated withered they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of chitchester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewy night pale an intricate and high
831-130746-0032.flac,at a foot fall at a roughness in the road she seemed to be too intent upon the escape to give much thought to him
831-130746-0033.flac,his mind became an enormous appreciation of the physician the night was warm white silence said for the subtle running of their chains
831-130746-0034.flac,he looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankle gracefully ruling the trebles now the road turned westward and she was a dark gray outline against the shimmer of the moon
831-130746-0035.flac,and now they face northwards and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow in cheek there is a magic quality in moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden
831-130746-0036.flac,it has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy root
831-130746-0037.flac, white dust hot under foot blinding to the eye is now a soft gray silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlit and its silver here and there overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence
831-130746-0038.flac,she who has spiritualized the world alone save for two attendant steady shining stars and in silence under her benign influence under the benediction of her light rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night
831-130746-0039.flac, nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mister hoop driver's skull at the turnings of the road he made his decision with an air of profound promptitude and quite hub hazard the right he would say or again
831-130746-0040.flac,the left as one who knew so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea
831-130746-0041.flac, aloe said mister hoop driver sado voka they dismounted abruptly stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side
831-130746-0042.flac, you are safe said mister hoop tribeourth sweeping off his cap with an air of bowing courtly where are we safe but where chitchester harbour he waved his arm's seaward as though it was a goal do you think they will follow us
831-130746-0043.flac,we have turned and turned again it seemed a hook driver that he heard her sob she stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath
831-130746-0044.flac,are you tired he asked i will do what has to be done the two black figures in the broken light were silent for a pace do you know she said i'm not afraid of you i am sure you are honest to me
831-130746-0045.flac,he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymyk it's a nugly name he said but you are right in trusting me i would i would do anything for you this
831-130746-0046.flac,prom stood help and protect me i was unhappy at home never mind why a stepmother idle unoccupied hindered cramped that is enough perhaps then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire
831-130746-0047.flac,to be a human being not a thing in a hutch and he i know said hoop driver and now here i am i will do anything said hoop driver she thought you cannot imagine my stepmother no i could not describe her
831-130746-0048.flac,i am entirely at your service i will help you with all my power i've lost an allusion and found a knight errant she spoke of beckumel as the allusion mister hoop driver felt flattered but he had no adequate answer
831-130746-0049.flac,what we had best be doing you are tired you know and we can't wander all night after the day we've had that was chit chaster we were near she asked if he meditated with a tremble in his voice
831-130746-0050.flac, you would make me your brother miss bonmond yes we could stop there together she took him in to answer i'm going to light these lamps said hoop driver he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe
831-130746-0051.flac, grave and intent how could she ever have thought him common or absurd but you must tell me your name brother she said errington said mister hoop driver after momentary pause
831-130746-0052.flac,who would be hoop driver on a night like this but the christian name christian name my christian name well christ he snapped his lamp and stood up if you will hold my machine i will light yours he said
831-130746-0053.flac,the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely she had to speak
831-130746-0054.flac,she said with a laugh to break the intensity he opened his mouth and shut it again and with the sudden winsing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine she looked down at him
831-130746-0055.flac, almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes it was as i have indicated the hour and season of the full moon
831-130746-0056.flac,and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converge there upon that chitchester was at last detained it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm
831-130746-0057.flac,but that night he was in the mood to dare anything so you found your young lady at last said the offsler of the red hotel
831-130746-0058.flac, white to misunderstanding said hoot driver with splendid reddenus my sister had gone to bognor but i brought her back here i took a fancy to this place and the moon lights simply divine we've had supper thanks and were tired said mister hoot driver
831-130746-0059.flac,i suppose you won't take anything jessie the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jessie like that but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit good night siss he said and pleasant dreams
831-130746-0060.flac,but this was living indeed he told himself
8468-286673-0000.flac,the slow little mud turtle when the twenty little mud turtles broke their eggshells when hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops
8468-286673-0001.flac, the mother turtle who was sending herself on the bank nearby said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them
8468-286673-0002.flac, and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters i'm coming in a minute the other little turtle is weighted but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail
8468-286673-0003.flac,and talked a while with him come on said the biggest little turtle don't let's wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed on to it and sat just close enough together
8468-286673-0004.flac,and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to quite as though he were out of patience about something why did new turtles wait for me
8468-286673-0005.flac, you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch
8468-286673-0006.flac,the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her next skin she was so eager to see them all
8468-286673-0007.flac,why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle who was trying to make a place for himself on the log they didn't wait for me he said i was coming right along but they wouldn't wait i think they are just as neat
8468-286673-0008.flac,the mother turtle raised one of her four feet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said
8468-286673-0009.flac,i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad
8468-286673-0010.flac,yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side
8468-286673-0011.flac,the first year i had only had few children the next year i had more and so it is gone every year a few more children than the year before until now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always one slow little turtle
8468-286673-0012.flac,who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him who that makes him missus share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody else's fault the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes
8468-286673-0013.flac,and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell side walls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell
8468-286673-0014.flac,i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sad very very sad
8468-286673-0015.flac,and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not have him with us long
8468-286673-0016.flac,i remember so well my first slow child and how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her four feet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little lever upper shell showing above the water
8468-286673-0017.flac,the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them
8468-286673-0018.flac,or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are landortesses
8468-286673-0019.flac,and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher backshells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water
8468-286673-0020.flac, and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond
8468-286673-0021.flac, their mother was with some of her friends on another log nearby she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their rounded up back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black
8468-286673-0022.flac,she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their web feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them
8468-286673-0023.flac,yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all
8468-286673-0024.flac,she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw too terrible great two legged animals waiting into the pond from the shore boys she sprawled off the end of her log
8468-286673-0025.flac,and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle
8468-286673-0026.flac,then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side upermost and wrapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes
8468-286673-0027.flac,next the other great animal took him and turned him over and wrapped on his shells and stared at him
8468-286673-0028.flac,he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass
8468-286673-0029.flac,he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell
8468-286673-0030.flac, this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you're going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go
8468-286673-0031.flac,then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night
8468-286673-0032.flac, i wish i might help you some time
8468-286673-0033.flac,i'm here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you i'm not hungry he murmured
8468-286673-0034.flac,and again he fell fast asleep
8468-286673-0035.flac, but cutled inside his two shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept
8468-286673-0036.flac,does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i'm so glad to get back i'll never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his
8468-286673-0037.flac,if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that
8468-286673-0038.flac,he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there
8468-286673-0039.flac,he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that he's queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot
8468-286673-0040.flac, and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle
8468-294887-0000.flac,and with a few others devoted the most of the Sabbath to their teaching when he and his brother arthur assembled the seventy anti slavery agents who were thereafter like firebrands scattered all over the land they held their meetings in this room
8468-294887-0001.flac, these agents were entertained by abolitionists in the city and many of us had two or three of them in each of our families for a couple of weeks
8468-294887-0002.flac,they went out all over the land and were instrumental in diffusing more truth perhaps about the dreadful system of american slavery than was accomplished in any other way he also aided in establishing several periodicals brimful of anti slavery truth
8468-294887-0003.flac,among which were the anti slavery record the emancipator the slaves friend the latter to indoctrinate the children in anti slavery the american missionary society originally begun for the support of a mission in africa
8468-294887-0004.flac,on the occasion of the return of the homestod captors to the native land and now doing so much for the freed men of the south was almost entirely established by his efforts during the continuance of slavery much was done by this society
8468-294887-0005.flac,the vigilance committee for aiding and fending fugitives of which i was treasurer for many years had no better or warmer friend than he he was almost always at their meetings which were known only to the elect for we dared not hold them too publicly
8468-294887-0006.flac, as we almost always had some of the travelers toward the north star present whose masters or their agents were frequently in the city in hot pursuit at first we sent them to canada but after a while sent them only to siracuse and the center of the state
8468-294887-0007.flac,in eighteen thirty four i think was the first writing the sacking of mister tapen's house in rose street the mob brought all his furniture out and piling it up in the street set it on fire the family were absent at the time
8468-294887-0008.flac, but hearing that there were a few loaded muskets there they took it out in threats but their mercantile establishment was almost ostracized at this time by the dry goods merchants
8468-294887-0009.flac, and when they did so requested particularly that the bundles or boxes should not be marked from a tap and end company as was customary southern merchants especially avoided them
8468-294887-0010.flac,and when two or three years later there was a general insolvency among them occasionally large losses to new york merchants and in some cases failure the tapens were saved by having no southern debts
8468-294887-0011.flac, many remittances came for the help of the vigilance committee from england and scotland and at one time an extensive invoice of useful and fancy articles in several large boxes was received from the glass gal ladies sufficient to furnish a large bazaar or fair
8468-294887-0012.flac, which was held in brooklyn for the benefit of the commie although lately afflicted by disease mister tapen still lives in the enjoyment of all his faculties and a good measure of health
8468-294887-0013.flac,and in his advanced years sees now some of the great results of his life long efforts for the restoration and maintenance of human rights although still suffering under many of the evils which slavery has inflicted upon him the american slave no longer exists
8468-294887-0014.flac,instead stands up in all our southern states the freed man knowing his rights and as a rule enjoying them original american abolitionists who met the scorn and odium the imputed shame and obliquely
8468-294887-0015.flac, ye have done it unto me anthony lane me york november eighth eighteen seventy one mister lane mister tapens personal friend who labored with him in the anti slavery cause
8468-294887-0016.flac, and especially in the vigilance committee for many years from the serious affection of his eyes
8468-294887-0017.flac, mister tapen was therefore requested to furnish a few reminiscences from his own store house which she kindly did as follows
8468-294887-0018.flac,my dear sir in answer to your request that i would furnish an article for your forthcoming book giving incidents within my personal knowledge relating to the underground railroad i have already apprised you of my illness and my consequent inability
8468-294887-0019.flac, to write such an article as would be worthy of your publication however feeling somewhat relieved to day from my paralysis owing to the cheering sunshine and the favor of my almighty preserver i will try to do what i can in dictating a few anecdotes to my emanuensis
8468-294887-0020.flac,which may afford you and your readers some gratification these facts i must give without reference to date as i will not tax my memory with perhaps a vain attempt to narrate them in order as mentioned in my life of arthur tapin
8468-294887-0021.flac,but reflection convinced them that it was not only right to assist men in efforts to obtain their liberty when unjustly held in bondage but a duty abolitionists white and colored both in slave and free states
8468-294887-0022.flac,those who had money contributed it freely and those who were destitute of money gave their time saying with the apostle silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee one
8468-294887-0023.flac, i recollect that one morning on reaching my office that of the treasure of the american missionary association my assistant told me that in the inner room were eighteen fugitives men women and children who had arrived that morning from the south in one company
8468-294887-0024.flac, whom they had hired to conduct them without the limits of the city in the evening when the police force was changed they came through pencilvania and new jerseys to my office
8468-294887-0025.flac, and by different agencies to canada two
8468-294887-0026.flac,a missus mercy smith beckoned to me to come to her class
8468-294887-0027.flac, in answer to my inquiries this girl told me the name of the southern city and the names of the persons who had held her as a slave and the motive or escape et cetera i was walking near the water she said when a white sailor spoke to me
8468-294887-0028.flac,if i would come to him in the evening i did so and was hid and fed by him and on landing at new york he conducted me to missus smith's house where i am now staying
8468-294887-0029.flac, most of the teachers were warm hearted abolitionists and the whole number taught in the school during this period was seven or eight hundred
8468-294887-0030.flac, to my inquiry have you parents living and also brothers and sisters she replied there is no child but myself were not your parents kind to you and did you not love them yes i love them very much
8468-294887-0031.flac,how were you treated by your master and mistress they treated me very well how then said i could you put yourself in the care of that sailor who was a stranger to you and leave your parents i shall never forget her heart felt reply
8468-294887-0032.flac,he told me i should be free one sunday morning i received a letter informing me that an officer belonging to savannah georgia had started for new york in pursuit of two young men of nineteen or twenty
8468-294887-0033.flac, and who had escaped and were supposed to be in new york the letter requested me to find them and give them warning as there was no time to be lost i concluded to go over to new york notwithstanding the doubtfulness of attempting to find them in so large a city
8468-294887-0034.flac,i wrote notices to be read in the colored churches and colored Sabbath schools which i delivered in person i then went to the colored school super intended
8468-294887-0035.flac,i stated my errand to him with a description of the young men why said he i must have one of them in my school he took me to a class where i found one of the young men to whom i gave the needful information
8468-294887-0036.flac,of savannah and that he had five children by the young man's mother who was his slave on his marriage to a white woman he sent his five colored children and their mother to auction to be sold for cash to the highest bidder
8468-294887-0037.flac,on being put upon the auction block this young man addressed the bystanders and told them the circumstances of the case that his mother had long lived in the family of the doctor that it was cruel to sell her and her children
8468-294887-0038.flac,and he warned the people not to bid for him for he would no longer be a slave to any man and if anyone bought him he would lose his money he added i thought it right to say this i then spoke to the crowd
8468-294887-0039.flac,my father said i has long been one of your first doctors and do you think it right for him to sell my mother and his children in this way i was sold and my brother also and the rest although my brother said to the crowd what i had said we soon made our escape
8468-294887-0040.flac, and are now both in the city i am a blacksmith and have worked six months in one shop in new york with white journeymen not one of whom believes i suppose that i am a colored man it was not surprising for so fair was his complexion
8468-294887-0041.flac,that with the aid of a brown wig after he had cut off his hair he was completely disguised he soon notified his brother who lived in another part of the city and both put themselves out of harm's way
8468-294887-0042.flac,they were remarkably fine young men and it seemed a special providence that i should find them in such a large city and direct them to escape from their pursuers within one hour after i left my house in brooklyn
8468-295198-0000.flac,and this was the case with mother magpie she was always full of everybody's business but her own up and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest knowing everyone's affairs telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do
8468-295198-0001.flac,and ready to cast her advice gratis at every bird in beast of the woods now she bustled up to the percentage at the top of the oak tree to tell old parson to it what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming
8468-295198-0002.flac,then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman who was always sleepy of a monday morning mother magpie would take a peep into missus oril's nest sit chattering on a bow above and poor forth floods of advice
8468-295198-0003.flac, depend upon it my dear mother magpie would say that this way of building your nest swing like an old empty stocking from a bow isn't it all the thing i never built one so in my life and i never have headaches
8468-295198-0004.flac,now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you it's all an account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner but my dear
8468-295198-0005.flac, piped missus oril timidly the orils always have built in this manner and its suits are constitution a fiddle on your constitution how can you tell what agrees with your constitution unless you try you own you are not well
8468-295198-0006.flac,you are subject to headaches and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain ask old doctor kite i was talking with him about your case only yesterday and says he missus magpie i perfectly agree with you
8468-295198-0007.flac, but my husband prefers this style of building that's only because he isn't properly instructed pray did you ever attend doctor kite's lectures on the nervous system no i have no time to attend lectures who would sit on the eggs
8468-295198-0008.flac, oh missus magpie pray don't speak to my husband he will think i've been complaining no no he won't let me alone i understand just how to say the thing i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave a fence
8468-295198-0009.flac, i say my dear if you'll persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie my dear i don't gossip she comes and boars me to death with talking and then goes off in mistakes which she has been saying for what i said
8468-295198-0010.flac,but you must cut her i try to all i can but she won't be cut it's enough to make a bird's square said tommy oril tommy oril to say the truth had his good heart as ever be it under bird's feathers
8468-295198-0011.flac,but then he had a weakness for concerts in general society because he was held to be by all odds the handsome as bird in the woods and sung like an angel and so the truth was he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom titmouse or billy wren
8468-295198-0012.flac,the fact is quothedommy i'm a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace and my wife must learn to accommodate if she has a brilliant husband
8468-295198-0013.flac, whose success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position she must pay something for it i'm sure billy wren's wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home to say the truth
8468-295198-0014.flac,my wife was all well enough content till old mother magpie interfered it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to
8468-295198-0015.flac,and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses if a metal sum magpie gets her claw into their nest but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter she bustled off down to water dock lane where as we said in a former narrative
8468-295198-0016.flac,live the old music teacher doctor bullfrog the poor old doctor was a simple minded good amiable creature who had played the double base and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when
8468-295198-0017.flac, latterly some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age in fact since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest tribes of wandering boys dignity of the forest tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits
8468-295198-0018.flac, which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts they pulled the young chequerberry before it even had time to blossom rooted up the sassifrash shrubs and nod their roots fired off guns at the birds and on several occasions
8468-295198-0019.flac,when old doctor bullfrog was leading a concert had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones this was not the worst of it the little violence had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts
8468-295198-0020.flac, that old bullfrog was a bore and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer
8468-295198-0021.flac, poor old doctor bull frog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him one morning well neighbor how unreasonable people are who would have thought
8468-295198-0022.flac, madam said doctor bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable i don't believe it i can't believe it you must have made a mistake
8468-295198-0023.flac,no no my good friend i never make mistakes what i know i know certainly
8468-295198-0024.flac, a nancy nibble who are married this very day i knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts and i can tell you you're going to be scandalously and ungratefully treated doctor bullfrog
8468-295198-0025.flac, bless me we shall all be ruined said missus bullfrog my poor husband oh as to that if you take things in time and listen to my advice said mother magpie we may yet pull you through you must alter your style a little
8468-295198-0026.flac, adapted to modern times everybody now is a little touched with the arctic fever and there's tommy oril has been to new orleans and brought back a touch of the artistic if you would try his style a little something tyrolean you see
8468-295198-0027.flac, dear madam consider my voice i never could hit the high notes how do you know it's all practice tommy oriel says so just try the scales as to your voice your manner of living has a great deal to do with it
8468-295198-0028.flac,i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing suppose tommy oril should sit half his days up to his hips and water as you do his voice would be its horse and rough as yours come up on the bank and learn to purge as we birds do
8468-295198-0029.flac,we are the true musical race and so poor mister bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cat tails where his green spectacles and honest round back had excited even in the minds of the boys sentiments of respect and compassion
8468-295198-0030.flac,he came up into the garden and established himself under a burden and began to practice Italian scales the result was that poor old doctor brofrog instead of being considered as a respectable old bore
8468-295198-0031.flac,got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners every bird and beast in the forest had a jay bad him and even old parson too it thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call
8468-295198-0032.flac, and admonish him about course's unbefitting his age and standing as to mother magpie you may be sure that she assured everyone how sorry she was that dear old doctor bullfrog had made such a fool of himself
8468-295198-0033.flac,but the tragedy for the poor old music teacher grew even more melancholy in its termination for one day as he was sitting disconsolately under a current bush in the garden practising his poor old notes in a quiet way thump
87-121553-0000.flac,and in its gyre had not turned wholly round before another in a ring and closed it and motion joined to motion song to song song that is greatly doth transcend our muses our sirens in those dulce at clarions as primal splendor that which is reflected

87-121553-0003.flac,out of the heart of one of the new lights there came a voice that needle to the star made me appear in turning thither word and it began the love that makes me fair draws me to speak about the other leader by whom so well is spoken here of mine

87-121553-0009.flac,the woman who for him had given a scent saw in a dream the admirable fruit that issue would from him and from his heirs and that he might be construed as he was a spirit from this place went forth to name him with his possessive whose he wholly was
87-121553-0010.flac,domenic was he called at him i speak of even as of the husband man whom christ elected his garden to assist him on voy and servant sooth he seemed of christ for the first love made manifest in him was the first council that was given by christ

87-121553-0012.flac,not for the world which people toil for now in following ostense and tadiot but through his longing after the true manner he in short time became so great a teacher that he began to go about the vineyard which faded soon if faithless be the dresser

87-121553-0026.flac,then broke the silence of those saints concordant the light in which the admirable life of god's own mendicant was told to me and said

87-121553-0048.flac,for will increase what air bestows on us of light grittoutus the good supreme light which enables us to look on him therefore the vision must perforce increase the ardor which from that is kindled increase the radiance which from this precedes

87-121553-0050.flac,nor so for them perhaps before the mothers the fathers and the rest who had been dear or ever they became eternal flames and low all round about of equal brightness arose a lustre over what was there like a horizon that is clearing up
87-121553-0051.flac,so that the sight seems real and unreal it seemed to me that new subsistences began there to be seen and make a circle outside the other two circumferences oh very sparkling of the holy spirit how sudden and incandescent it became unto my eyes that vanquished bore it not
87-121553-0052.flac,but be itrist so beautiful and smiling appeared to me that with the other sights that followed not my memory i must leave her then to uplift themselves my eyes resumed the power and i beheld myself translated to higher salvation with my lady only
87-121553-0053.flac, well was i where that i was more uplifted by the incindled smiling of the star that seemed to me more ruddy than its want with all my heart and in that dialect which is the same in all such holocaust to god i made as the new grace beceived
87-121553-0054.flac,and not yet from my bosom was exhausted the ardour of sacrifice before i knew this offering was accepted and auspicious for with so great a lustre and so red splendours appeared to me in two fold rays i said oh helios who does so adorn them
87-121553-0055.flac,even as distinct with less and greater lights glimmers between the two poles of the world the galaxy that makeeth wise men doubt thus constallated in the depths of mars those rays described the venerable sign that quadrants joining in a circle make

87-121553-0057.flac,so from the lights that there to me appeared up gathered through the cross a melody which wrapped me not distinguishing the him well was i where it was of lofty law because there came to me a rise and conquer as unto him who hears and comprehends not
87-121553-0058.flac,so much enamoured i became therewith that until then there was not anything that air had fettered me with such sweet bonds perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold postponing the delight of those fair eyes into which gazing my desire has rest
87-121553-0059.flac,but who bethinks him that the living seals of every beauty grow in power ascending and that i there had not turned round to those can me excuse if i myself accuse to excuse myself and see that i speak truly for hear the holy joys not disclosed
87-121553-0060.flac,a will benign in which reveals itself ever the love that righteousnessl inspires as in the iniquitous cupidity silence imposed upon that dalset liar and quieted the consecrated cords

87-121553-0062.flac,who for the love of thing that doth not last eternally dispoys him of that love as through the pure and tranquil evening air there shoots from time to time a sudden fire moving the eyes that steadfast were before
87-121553-0063.flac,and seems to be a star the change of place except that in the part where it is kindled nothing is missus and this endurith little so from the horn that to the right extends unto that cross's foot there ran a star out of the constellation shining there

8975-270782-0000.flac,thirteenth lecture the dream archaic reminence and infantilism in the dream let us revert to our conclusion that the dream work under the influence of the dream censorship
8975-270782-0001.flac, transforms the latent dream thoughts into some other form of expression the latent thoughts are no other than the conscious thoughts known to us in our waking hours the new mode of expression is incomprehensible to us because of its many sighted features
8975-270782-0002.flac, so we call the mode of expression of the dream work they are chaos or regressive you may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dream work we gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our intellectual development i trust this will be true
8975-270782-0003.flac,but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken the antiquity into which the dream work carries a spark is of a double aspect firstly the individual antiquity childhood and secondly insofar as every individual in his childhood
8975-270782-0004.flac, that we shall be able to differentiate which part of the late and psychic proceedings has its source in the individual
8975-270782-0005.flac, in this connection it appears to me for example that the symbolic relations which the individual has never learned
8975-270782-0006.flac, however this is not the only archaic characteristic of the dream you probably all know from your own experiences the peculiar amnesia that is loss of memory concerning childhood i mean the fact that the first years to the fifth
8975-270782-0007.flac, that of a gap in the memory is far more frequent i believe we have not laid enough stress on this fact the child is able to speak well at the age of two it soon shows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic situations
8975-270782-0008.flac,and makes remarks which years later are retold to it but which it has itself entirely forgotten besides the memory in the early years is more fastened because it is less burdened than in later years
8975-270782-0009.flac, nor is there any reason for considering the memory function as a particularly high or difficult psychic performance in fact the contrary is true and you can find a good memory in persons who stand very low intellectually
8975-270782-0010.flac,i must point out that certain well preserved memories for the most part formatively experienced stand forth in this memory void which surrounds the first years of childhood and do not justify this hypothesis
8975-270782-0011.flac,our memory deals selectively with its later materials with impressions which come to us in later life it retains the important and discards the unimportant this is not true of the retained childhood memories
8975-270782-0012.flac,they do not be speak necessarily important experiences of childhood not even such as from the viewpoint of the child need a peer of importance they are often so benal and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves and wonder why just these details
8975-270782-0013.flac, have escaped being forgotten i once endeavored to approach the riddle of childhood amnesia and the interrupted memory reminence with the help of analysis and i arrived at the conclusion that in the case of the child too
8975-270782-0014.flac, by means of careful analysis one is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten
8975-270782-0015.flac, and in so far as the cure is to any degree successful we are able again to bring to light the content of the childhood years thus clouded in forgetfulness these impressions have never really been forgotten they have only been inaccessible latent
8975-270782-0016.flac,and have belonged to the unconscious but sometimes they bob up out of the unconscious spontaneously and as a matter of fact this is what happens in dreams it is apparent that the dream life knows how to find the entrance to these latent
8975-270782-0017.flac, beautiful examples of this occurred in literature and i myself can present such an example i once dreamed in a certain connection of a person who must have performed some service for me and who might clearly see all he was a one eyed man short and stature stout
8975-270782-0018.flac,his head deeply sunk into his knack i concluded from the content that he was a physician luckily i was able to ask my mother who was still living how the physician in my birth place which i left when i was three years old looked
8975-270782-0019.flac, and i learned from her that he had one eye was short and stout with his head sunk into his neck and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me this control over the forgotten material of childhood years
8975-270782-0020.flac, is then a further archaic tendency of the dream the same information may be made you sub in another of the puzzles that have presented themselves to us you will recall how astonished people were
8975-270782-0021.flac,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he
8975-270782-0022.flac, in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asked the question when such a wish comes
8975-270782-0023.flac,we need not hesitate to point out this origin these evil impulses have their origin in the past often in a past which is not too far away
8975-270782-0024.flac,the woman whose dream is interpreted to me that she would like to see her seventeen year old daughter dead discovers under our guidance that she in fact at one time entertained this wish
8975-270782-0025.flac, which early ended in a separation
8975-270782-0026.flac,she beat her body with her fists in a fit of anger in order to kill the child how many mothers who to day love their children tenderly perhaps too tenderly received them unwillingly and at the time wished that the life within them would not develop further
8975-270782-0027.flac, indeed translated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some loved one which seemed so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person
8975-270782-0028.flac,this wish was no stranger to him while the child was still a suckling this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom
8975-270782-0029.flac, that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur
8975-270782-0030.flac,only wish to warn you that you are to take into consideration not the exact terms of the dream but the meaning thereof according to its interpretation it may happen that the manifest dream of the death of some loved person has only made use of some frightful mask
8975-270782-0031.flac, that it really means something entirely different or that the loved person serves as a concealing substitute for some other but the same circumstance will call forth another more difficult question you say granted this death wish was present at some time or other
8975-270782-0032.flac,and a substantiated by memory yet this is no explanation it is long outlived today it can be present only in the unconscious and as an empty emotionless memory but not as a strong impulse why should it be recalled by the dream at all this question is justified
8975-270782-0033.flac, in one of the most important points of dream study but i must remain within the bounds of our discussion and practice restraint prepare yourselves for the temporary abstention let us be satisfied with the circumstantial proof
8975-270782-0034.flac, that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past let us continue with the removal or death wish
8975-270782-0035.flac,which most frequently can be traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer
8975-270782-0036.flac,as often as someone has been in our way in life and how often must this happen in the complicated relationships of life the dream is ready to do away with him be he father mother brother sister spouse et cetera
8975-270782-0037.flac, we have wondered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature and certainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past
8975-270782-0038.flac, or real remnants thereof show themselves for the child loves itself first and later learns to love others to sacrifice something of its ego for another
8975-270782-0039.flac,even those persons whom the child seems to love from the very beginning it loves at the outset because it has need of them cannot do without them in other words out of egoistical motives
8975-270782-0040.flac, not until later does the love impulse become independent of egoism in brief egoism has taught the child to love in this connection it is instructive to compare the child's regard
8975-270782-0041.flac,for his brothers and sisters with that which he has for his parents
8975-270782-0042.flac, often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling or rather let us say glossed over but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier it is most notable in children of from two and one half
8975-270782-0043.flac, to four or five years of age when a new little brother or sister arrives a latter is usually received in a far from friendly manner expression such as i don't want him let the store take him away again are very usual
8975-270782-0044.flac, subsequently every opportunity is made use of to disparage the new arrival and even attempts to do him bodily harm direct attacks are not unheard of
8975-270782-0045.flac,if the difference in age is less the child learns of the existence of the rival with intense psychic activity and accommodates himself to the new situation if the difference in age is greater the new child may awaken certain sympathies as an
8975-270782-0046.flac, interesting object as a sort of living dull and if the difference is eight years or more motherly impulses especially in the case of girls may come into play but to be truthful when we disclose in a dream the wish for the death of a mother or sister
8975-270782-0047.flac,we need seldom find it puzzling and may trace its origin easily to early childhood often enough also to the propinquity of later years probably no nurseries are free from mighty conflicts among the inhabitants
8975-270782-0048.flac,the motives are rivalry for the love of the parents article zoned in common the room itself the hostile impulses are called forth by older as well as younger brothers and sisters
8975-270782-0049.flac,if there is any one who hates a young english lady more than does her mother it is her elder sister there is something about this saying however that arouses our own tippity we can at a pinch understand hatred of brothers and sisters
8975-270782-0050.flac, and rivalry among them but how way feelings of hatred force their way into the relationship between daughter and mother parents and children this relationship is without doubt the more favorable even when looked at from the viewpoint of the child
8975-270782-0051.flac,this is in accord with our expectation we find it much more offensive for love between parents and children to be lacking than for love between brothers and sisters we have so to speak made something wholly in the first instance
8975-270782-0052.flac, which in the other case we permitted to remain profane
8975-270782-0053.flac,the feelings between parents and their grown children failed to come up to the ideal established by society how much enmity exists and would find expression did not accumulations of piety and of tender impulse hold them back the motives for this are everywhere known
8975-270782-0054.flac,and disclosed a tendency to separate those at the same sex daughter from mother father from son the daughter finds in her mother the authority that hems in her will and that is entrusted with the task of causing her to carry out
8975-270782-0055.flac,the abstention from sexual liberty which society demands in certain cases also she is the rival who objects to being displaced the same type of thing occurs in a more glaring manner between father and son
8975-270782-0056.flac,to the sun the father is the embodiment of every social restriction born with such great opposition the father bars the way to freedom of will to early sexual satisfaction
8975-270782-0057.flac, to the enjoyment thereof impatient waiting for the death of the father grows to heights approximating tragedy in the case of a successor to the throne less stringed is the relationship between father and daughter mother and son
8975-270782-0058.flac,the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistical considerations why do i speak of these things so banal and so well known
8975-270782-0059.flac, because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny the significance in life and to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing much oftener than it really is fulfilled but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth
8975-270782-0060.flac, rather than that this task should be left to the synod in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal
8975-270782-0061.flac,it is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people the dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents especially the parent of the same sex we may conclude that it is also present during waking hours
8975-270782-0062.flac,as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example three it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses
8975-270782-0063.flac,by which it is suppressed and must wait until a dream isolates it that which the dream shows us in enlarged formwirm as a result of such isolation shrinks together again after it has been properly dogged in its relation to life as a result of our interpretation
8975-270782-0064.flac, h sacks but we also find this stream wish in places where it has no connection with life and where the adult in his waking hours would never recognize it the reason for this is that the deepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly
8975-270782-0065.flac,especialty between persons of the same sex has already made its influence felt in earliest childhood i mean the love rivalry with the especial emphasis of the sex character the son even as a small child
8975-270782-0066.flac,who was a disturbing element in her tender relationship with her father and who occupied the position that she could very well fill herself one learns from these observations to what early years these ideas extend back
8975-270782-0067.flac, ideas which we designate as the edipous complex because this myth realizes with a very slightly weakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the sun to kill his father and take his mother to wife
8975-270782-0068.flac,i do not wish to maintain that the edifice complex covers entirely the relation of the child to its parents this relation can be much more complicated furthermore the edifice complex is more or less well developed it may even experience a reversal
8975-270782-0069.flac,but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child and one tends rather to under estimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments which may follow from it in addition
8975-270782-0070.flac, children frequently react to the edifice idea through stimulation by the parents who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences so that the father prefers the daughter the mother the son
8975-270782-0071.flac,and this love is substituted for the outworn love one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the edipiss complex on the contrary it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults
8975-270782-0072.flac, and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this prescribed or tabooed feeling relationship later made good the omission by taking all value from the complex through false interpretations according to my unchanged conviction
8975-270782-0073.flac,cast out of life was yielded up to poetry and given the freest play oh rank has shown in a careful study how this very edipous complex has supplied dramatic literature
8975-270782-0074.flac, with a large number of motives in unending variations derivations and disguises also indistorted forms such as we recognize to be the work of a censor we may also ascribe this edipous complex to those dreamers
8975-270782-0075.flac,who were so fortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents and intimately associated with we find what we call the castration complex the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father
8975-270782-0076.flac, by applying our former researches to the study of the psyche of the child we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden dream wishes of excessive sexual impulses may be explained in the same manner
8975-270782-0077.flac, thus we are moved to study the development of sex life in the child also and we discover the following from a number of sources in the first place it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual life and to take it for granted
8975-270782-0078.flac, that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects
8975-270782-0079.flac,but we call perverse in the life of an adult differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the growth between man and animal second
8975-270782-0080.flac, being insensible to the conventional feeling of disgust third the incest limitation being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction with near blood relations fourth homosexuality and fifth
8975-270782-0081.flac,he knows no unbridgeable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguished himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he has not disgusted at the sight of experiment but slowly learned to be so disgusted
8975-270782-0082.flac,under the pressure of education he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes rather a credit's to both the same genital formation
8975-270782-0083.flac,tward those persons closest to him and who are dear to him for various reasons his parents brothers and sisters nurses and finally you may observe in him that which later breaks through again rays now to a love attraction
8975-270782-0084.flac,polymorethus perverse and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses it is on the one hand because of their lesser intensity as compared to later life and on the other hand
8975-270782-0085.flac, and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child
8975-270782-0086.flac, and then at the writing table defend this sexual purity of the same children were children are left to themselves or are under the influence of corruption
8975-270782-0087.flac, of perverse sexual activity to be sure the grown ups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances as play for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of custom or before the law
8975-270782-0088.flac, but these things do exist they have their significances indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and furtherances of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man
8975-270782-0089.flac,when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field
8975-270782-0090.flac,those directed toward sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what in tippity society fields toward such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it
8975-270782-0091.flac,the most monstrous efforts have been made to explain this fear of incest some have believed that it is due to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature which is psychically represented by this prohibition because in breeding would deteriorate the race character
8975-270782-0092.flac, others made saying that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the person's under consideration in both cases furthermore the incestive avoidance would be automatically assured
8975-270782-0093.flac, and most customary choice and that not until later is there any resistance the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology
8975-270782-0094.flac, toward the understanding of the dream we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream
8975-270782-0095.flac,with all its peculiarities its egoism its incestuous love choice et cetera continues for the purposes of the dream in the unconscious
8975-270782-0096.flac, infantile sight of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions partly because it is lightly considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child
8975-270782-0097.flac, since the dream regresses to this stage it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us but it is only a deceptive appearance by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams
8975-270782-0098.flac,if the evil impulses of the dream are merely infantilism or returned to the beginnings of our ethical development since the dream simply makes children of us again in thinking and in feeling we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable
8975-270782-0099.flac,but being reasonable is only a part of psychic life many things are taking place there that are not reasonable and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams and unreasonably we turn them over to the dream censorship
8975-270782-0100.flac, are shamed and angry of one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form
8975-270782-0101.flac, as we would be if we understood it just think of the scandalized opinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of services of love the problem is not yet solved
8975-270782-0102.flac, and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts
8975-270782-0103.flac, which however disclosed only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dreamwork is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression
8975-270782-0104.flac,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even are old intellectual property
8975-270782-0105.flac, unconscious is no longer a name for what is it that time latent the unconscious is in a special psychic round with which impulses of its own with its own method of expression and with a psychic mechanism peculiar to itself
8975-270782-0106.flac, but the latent dream thoughts which we have solved by means of the dream interpretation are not of this realm they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours still they are unconscious
8975-270782-0107.flac, how does one solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that chairs its characteristics
8975-270782-0108.flac, the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication
8975-270782-0109.flac, between these two parts the dream work completes itself the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious necessitates regression this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream
8975-270782-0110.flac, that we are able to attain without having searched through further psychic realms the time will soon come however when we shall close the unconscious character of the latent dream thought with another name
8975-270782-0111.flac,which shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we may to be sure propound the question what forces the psychological activity during sleep to such regression
8975-270782-0112.flac, why do not the sleep disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it and if they must because of the dream censorship disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible
8975-270782-0113.flac, what is the use of giving new life to old long outgrown psychic stimuli wishes and character types that is why the material regression in addition to the formal the only satisfactory answer would be this
8975-270782-0114.flac, that only in this manner can a dream be built up
