44,8468-295198-0032.flac,and admonish him about courses unbefitting his age and standing as to mother magpie you may be sure that she assured everyone how sorry she was that dear old dr bullfrog had made such a fool of himself
45,8468-295198-0030.flac,he came up into the garden and established himself under a birddock and began to practice italian scales the result was that poor old dr bullfrog instead of being considered as a respectable old boar
46,8468-295198-0031.flac,got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners every bird and beast in the forest had a jab at him and even old parson to it thought it worth as wild to make him a pastoral call
47,8468-295198-0029.flac,we are the true musical race and so poor mr bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cattails whereas green spectacles and honest round back had excited even in the minds of the boys sentiments of respect and compassion
48,8468-295198-0028.flac,i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing suppose tommy oriole should sit half his days up to his hips and water as you do his voice would be its horse and rough as yours come up on the bank and learn to perch as we birds do
49,8468-295198-0005.flac,piped mrs oriole timidly the orioles always have built in this manner and it suits our constitution a fiddle on your constitution how can you tell what agrees with your constitution unless you try you own you are not well
50,8468-295198-0026.flac,adapted to modern times everybody now is a little touched with the operatic fever and there's tommy oriole has been to new orleans and brought back a touch of the artistic if you would try his style a little something tyrolean you see
51,8468-295198-0020.flac,that old bullfrog was a boar and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer
52,8468-295198-0017.flac,laterally some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age in fact since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits
53,8468-295198-0012.flac,the fact is quote tommy i'm a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace and my wife must learn to accommodate if she has a brilliant husband
54,8468-295198-0000.flac,and this was the case with mother magpie she was always full of everybody's business but her own up and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest knowing everyone's affairs telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do
55,8468-295198-0007.flac,but my husband prefers this style of building that's only because he isn't properly instructed pray did you ever attend dr kite's lectures on the nervous system no i have no time to attend lectures who would sit on the eggs
56,8468-295198-0015.flac,and sometimes we'll take the most unreasonable courses if a metal some magpie gets her claw into their nest but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter she bustled off down to waterdock lane where as we said in a former narrative
57,8468-295198-0018.flac,which old mother nature it always kept up in those parts they pulled the young checkerberry before it even had time to blossom rooted up the sassafras shrubs and nod their roots fired off guns at the birds and on several occasions
58,8468-295198-0013.flac,whose success gratifies her ambition in places her in a distinguished public position she must pay something for it i'm sure billy wrens wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home to say the truth
59,8468-295198-0022.flac,madame said dr bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable i don't believe it i can't believe it you must have made a mistake
60,8468-295198-0008.flac,oh mrs magpie prey don't speak to my husband he will think i've been complaining no no he won't let me alone i understand just how to say the thing i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave a fence
61,8468-295198-0014.flac,my wife was all well enough content till old mother magpie interfered it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to
62,8468-295198-0023.flac,no no my good friend i never make mistakes what i know i know certainly
63,8468-295198-0002.flac,then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman who is always sleepy of a monday morning mother magpie would take a peep into mrs orias nest sit chattering on a bow above and pour forth floods of advice
64,8468-295198-0006.flac,you are subject to headaches and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain ask old dr kite i was talking with him about your case only yesterday and says he mrs magpie i perfectly agree with you
65,8468-295198-0019.flac,when old dr bullfrog was leading a concert had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones this was not the worst of it the little varlets had a way of cheering at the simple old doctor and his concerts
66,8468-295198-0027.flac,dear madam consider my voice i never could hit the high notes how do you know it's all practice tommy oriole says so just try the scales as to your voice your manner of living has a great deal to do with it
67,8468-295198-0011.flac,but then he had a weakness for concerts and general society because he was held to be by all odds the hansen's bird in the woods and sung like an angel and so the truth was he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom titmouse or billy ren
68,8468-295198-0001.flac,and ready to cast her advice gratus at every bird and beast of the woods now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the oak tree to tell old parson to it what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming
69,8468-295198-0021.flac,poor old dr bullfrog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him 1 morning well neighbor how unreasonable people are who would have thought
70,8468-295198-0009.flac,i say my dear if you will persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie my dear i don't gossip she comes and bores me to death with talking and then goes off and mistakes what she has been saying for what i said
71,8468-295198-0003.flac,depend upon it my dear mother magpie would say that this way of building your nest swinging like an old empty stocking from a bow isn't at all the thing i never built 1 so in my life and i never have headaches
72,8468-295198-0010.flac,but you must cut her i try to all i can but she won't be cut it's enough to make a bird swear said tommy oriole tommy oriole to say the truth had as good a heart as ever beat under bird's feathers
73,8468-295198-0016.flac,live the old music teacher dr bullfrog the poor old doctor was a simple-minded good amiable creature who had played the double bass and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when
74,8468-295198-0004.flac,now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you it's all on account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner but my dear
75,8468-295198-0025.flac,bless me we shall all be ruined said mrs bullfrog my poor husband oh as to that if you take things in time and listen to my advice said mother magpie we may yet pull you through you must alter your style a little
76,8468-295198-0024.flac,and nancy nibble who are married this very day i knew that thing 6 weeks before any bird or beast in our parts and i can tell you you're going to be scandalously and ungrateful treated dr bullfrog
77,8468-286673-0020.flac,and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise when beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the 20 little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond
78,8468-286673-0040.flac,and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle
79,8468-286673-0012.flac,who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him that makes him mrs share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody else's fault the slow little turtle felt the 10 brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes
80,8468-286673-0030.flac,this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you're going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go
81,8468-286673-0036.flac,does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i'm so glad to get back i'll never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his
82,8468-286673-0006.flac,the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well the mother turtle stretched your head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neck skin she was so eager to see them all
83,8468-286673-0008.flac,the mother turtle raised 1 of her 4 feet until all 5 of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the 1 she said
84,8468-286673-0025.flac,and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle
85,8468-286673-0035.flac,but coddled inside is 2 shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept
86,8468-286673-0039.flac,he is the quickest 1 in his family the pawn people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot
87,8468-286673-0024.flac,she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw 2 terrible great 2-leg animals waiting into the pond from the shore boys she cried boys and she sprawled off the end of her log
88,8468-286673-0004.flac,and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to quite as though he were out of patience about something why didn't you turtles wait for me
89,8468-286673-0010.flac,yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure as mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the 10 brothers and sisters on that side
90,8468-286673-0002.flac,and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters i'm coming in a minute the other little turtles waited but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail
91,8468-286673-0019.flac,and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher back shells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water
92,8468-286673-0028.flac,he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass
93,8468-286673-0003.flac,and talked a while with him come on said the biggest little turtle don't let's wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together
94,8468-286673-0023.flac,yes set a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all
95,8468-286673-0022.flac,she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their web feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them
96,8468-286673-0009.flac,i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad
97,8468-286673-0021.flac,their mother was with some of her friends on another log nearby she looked often at her children and thought how handsome they're rounded up back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black
98,8468-286673-0037.flac,if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that
99,8468-286673-0013.flac,and the 9 brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell sidewalls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell
100,8468-286673-0032.flac,i wish i might help you sometime
101,8468-286673-0015.flac,and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not have him with us long
102,8468-286673-0014.flac,i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have 1 family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from 1 of my eggs yet it makes me sad very very sad
103,8468-286673-0026.flac,then 1 of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and wrapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with 2 great eyes
104,8468-286673-0027.flac,next the other great animal took him and turned him over and wrapped on a shells and stared at him
105,8468-286673-0016.flac,i remember so well my first slow child and how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her 4 feet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only your head and a little lever upper shell showing above the water
106,8468-286673-0038.flac,he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when 1 day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there
107,8468-286673-0005.flac,you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch
108,8468-286673-0001.flac,the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank nearby said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them
109,8468-286673-0029.flac,he lay perfectly still for long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and 1 of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell
110,8468-286673-0011.flac,the first year i had only a few children the next year i had more and so it is gone every year a few more children than the year before until now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always 1 slow little turtle
111,8468-286673-0000.flac,the slow little mud turtle when the 20 little mud turtles broke their eggshells 1 hot summer day and poke their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops
112,8468-286673-0018.flac,or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises
113,8468-286673-0017.flac,the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them
114,8468-286673-0034.flac,and again he fell fast asleep

179,6000-86686-0024.flac,and so the king had his goose as good as new to divert him as long as he lived and the saints supported him after he came into his property as i told you until the day of his death and that was soon after for the poor goose that he was catching a trout on friday

183,6000-86686-0007.flac,is it a tinkerer you are says the king no says the saint i'm no tinker by trade king of tool
184,6000-86686-0009.flac,with that the king whistled and down came the poor goose just like a hound waddling up to the poor crippled her master and as like him as 2 peas the minute the saint clapped his eyes on the goose i'll do the job for you says he king ou
185,6000-86686-0000.flac,well well but the darkness of mankind is untold well sir you must know as you didn't hear it a 4 that there was a king

188,6000-86686-0008.flac,says see what would you say says he if i made your old goose as good as new my dear at the word of making his goose as good as new you'd think the poor old king's eyes were ready to jump out of his head
189,6000-86686-0010.flac,by germany says king ou if you do all say you're the cleverest fellow in the 7 par oh my dad says st kevin

193,6000-86686-0017.flac,looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark and better than ever she was
194,6000-86686-0021.flac,then says the king who are you i'm saying to kevin said the saint blessing himself oh queen of heaven says the king making the sign of the cross between his eyes and falling down at his knees before the saint it is the great saint kevin says he
195,6000-86686-0016.flac,and throwing her up into the air who says he just given her a blast to help her and with that my jewels she took to her heels flying like 1 of the eagles themselves and cutting as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain
196,6000-86686-0012.flac,says the saint that's the way to do business now
197,6000-86686-0025.flac,but my jewel it was a mistake he made and instead of a trout it was a thieving horseshoe and instead of the goose killing a trout for the king's supper by dad the eel killed the king's goose and small blame to him
198,6000-86686-0015.flac,and aside that will make you the sporting bird with that my dear he took up the goose by the 2 wings

202,6000-86686-0018.flac,says st kevin for making her the like by chambers says the king i say nothing beats the art of man bar in the bees and do you say no more nor that says st kevin and that i'm beholden to you says the king
203,6000-86686-0020.flac,when the king was as good as his word st kevin was pleased with him and then it was that he made himself known to the king and says he king oul you're a decent ban for i only came here to try you you don't know me says he because i'm disguised moshe
204,6000-55211-0024.flac,and there's the tray did you notice he exalted turning back to the shelf you don't see that every day they get separated most generally you know these pieces have been in our family for generations said mrs gregory with an accent of pride
205,6000-55211-0007.flac,and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought best to try to get over to the house maybe aunt hannah would come too for lunch in would she i'm afraid not returned billy with a roof a laugh she's got 3 shaws on this morning
206,6000-55211-0004.flac,though i wanted you to see the teapot too
207,6000-55211-0041.flac,william henshaw frowned angrily that was the man but his eyes the collector's eyes sought the teapot longingly before either the man or the collector could speak however mrs gregory interposed quick words of remonstrance
208,6000-55211-0010.flac,nonsense uncle william of course you won't turn back
209,6000-55211-0053.flac,or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something during the brief minute that he hesitated however billy sprang forward mrs gregory please won't you let me by the teapot
210,6000-55211-0047.flac,alice gregory turned as if stung wished to sell she repeated the words with superb disdain she was plainly very angry her blue grey eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair
211,6000-55211-0003.flac,harlow says others will have to know of it of course you see she's just made up her mind to sell it and asked him to find a customer i wouldn't trouble you but he says they're peculiar the daughter specially and may need some careful handling that's why i wanted you
212,6000-55211-0055.flac,but it was 1 that might be expected perhaps from billy mrs gregory must have defined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking dear child she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own
213,6000-55211-0012.flac,billy really i think we should turn back but billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white-haired sweet-faced woman who said yes she was mrs gregory yes she was even as she uttered the words
214,6000-55211-0009.flac,but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown i declare billy i'm not sure but we'd better turn back he fretted i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this billy shivered a little
215,6000-55211-0023.flac,with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot his eyes sparkled billy look what a beauty and it's the lowest of 2 the real thing the genuine true soft paste
216,6000-55211-0019.flac,though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke the lowest staffed yes i'm so glad that is of course i must be glad i'll get it her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair
217,6000-55211-0054.flac,and then won't you keep it for me here i haven't the hundred dollars with me but i'll send it right away you will let me do it won't you it was an impulsive speech and a foolish 1 of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness
218,6000-55211-0040.flac,as i started to tell you when i came in i have 2 new pupils and so turning to the man again i thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present
219,6000-55211-0042.flac,but alice my dear she almost sobbed you didn't wait to let me tell you
220,6000-55211-0048.flac,do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing she's treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing alice
221,6000-55211-0052.flac,you are very kind mr henshaw but i do not think we care to sell the lowest off today both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh william henshaw picked up his hat his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do
222,6000-55211-0056.flac,even while she shook her head in denial not so her daughter alice gregory flushed scarlet she drew herself proudly erect thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us
223,6000-55211-0043.flac,he will give us $100 $100 echoed the girl faintly
224,6000-55211-0058.flac,come billy will bid you good morning ladies said william henshaw then decisively and billy with a little wistful pat on mrs gregory's clasped hands went once down the long 4 flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk
225,6000-55211-0039.flac,nielsen supplied the man as she looked at billy and hesitated a swift red stained alice gregory's face with barely an acknowledgement of the introductions she turned to her mother yes dear with that won't be necessary now
226,6000-55211-0027.flac,madame if you do not wish to sell he stopped abruptly his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china mrs gregory gave a low cry but i do that is i must
227,6000-55211-0061.flac,still i was sorry for the poor little old lady i wish somehow she could have had that hundred dollars it was the man who said this not the collector so do i rejoined billy doy
228,6000-55211-0032.flac,the collector's eyes glowed he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it then he turned to the tray after a moment he spoke i have only 1 other in my collection as rare he said
229,6000-55211-0038.flac,stammered mrs gregory wedding her lips with an air of hurried apology and consili this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it or my daughter alice mr henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and miss
230,6000-55211-0050.flac,perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darned and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes alice gasped mrs gregory and dismayed horror
231,6000-55211-0008.flac,i'll tell her though and i'll see you at 11:00 finished billy as she hung up the receiver promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william at park street and together they set out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket
232,6000-55211-0005.flac,that she was 1 day to be mistress of the strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her i'd love to see it and i'll come gladly but i'm afraid i won't be much help uncle william she worried i'll take the risk of that
233,6000-55211-0037.flac,william henshaw 2 raised his chin he also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people my name is henshaw miss gregory i presume he said quietly i was sent here by mr harlow
234,6000-55211-0022.flac,near it set a tray like plate of the same wear and decoration if you lift it down please yourself motioned mrs gregory i don't like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side
235,6000-55211-0036.flac,mother what is it who are these people she asked sharply billy lifted her chin the least bit she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice
236,6000-55211-0060.flac,the girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vicks inish little puss i ever saw i didn't want her old louis stopped if she didn't want to sell it but to practically invite me there then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger
237,6000-55211-0033.flac,i paid a hundred dollars for that i shall be glad to give you the same for this madam mrs gregory started visibly hundred dollars so much as that she cried almost joyously
238,6000-55211-0044.flac,billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass
239,6000-55211-0013.flac,however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion mrs gregory was a cripple her slender little body was poised on 2 once costly crutches
240,6000-55211-0030.flac,she finished with a wistful whimsicality billy turned away sharply there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot
241,6000-55211-0021.flac,what a beauty mrs gregory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair disclosing on 1 of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy and tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design
242,6000-55211-0035.flac,mother only think i've she stopped and drew back a little her startled eyes went from 1 face to another then dropped to the lowest oft teapot in the man's hands her expression changed at once she shut the door quickly and hurried forward
243,6000-55211-0026.flac,i have been told so yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association my mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir again her voice broke william penshaw cleared his throat but
244,6000-55211-0000.flac,chapter 16 a girl and a bit of lowestoft immediately after breakfast the next morning billy was summoned to the telephone oh good morning uncle william she called an answer to the masculine voice that replied to her hello
245,6000-55211-0059.flac,william henshaw drew a long breath while by jove billy the next time i take you carrillo hunting it won't be to this place he fumed wasn't it awful choked billy awful
246,6000-55211-0034.flac,br of course if it's worth that to you she paused suddenly a quick step had sounded in the hall outside the next moment the door flew open

249,6000-55211-0025.flac,you'll find them quite perfect i think perfect i should say they were cried the man they are then valuable mrs gregory's voice shook indeed they are but you must know that
250,6000-55211-0031.flac,or against uncle william for wanting the teapot or for not wanting it if he did not buy it and so you see i do very much wish to sell mrs gregory said then perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously
251,6000-55211-0049.flac,i can't help it to storm the girl hotly i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it
252,6000-55211-0014.flac,both the warren places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new 1 billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay
253,6000-55211-0006.flac,we have funny well i'll come at 11 you say at park street yes and thank you my dear i tried to get kate to go too but she wouldn't by the way i'm going to bring you home to lunch in kate leaves this afternoon you know
254,6000-55211-0015.flac,mechanically she had taken the chair toward which mrs gregory had motioned her she had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not 1 detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain
255,6000-55211-0051.flac,with a little outward fling of her 2 hands alice gregory stepped back her face had grown white again i beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet i should not have spoken so
256,6000-55211-0020.flac,there was only despairing sorrow on her face now the man rows at once
257,6000-55211-0029.flac,but with only 1 foot to make it go you see the other is
258,6000-55211-0017.flac,we are i came from harlow mrs gregory he gave me to understand that you had an a teapot that with his eyes on the cracked white crockery picture on the table william henshaw came to a helpless pause
259,6000-55211-0002.flac,it's a genuine lowest off tarlow says will you go of course i will what time 11 if you can at park street she's at the west end
260,6000-55211-0018.flac,a curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed mrs gregory's face terror joy dismay and relief seemed 1 after the other to fight for supremacy relief in the end concord
261,6000-55211-0011.flac,she finished just above her breath mrs gregory was found to be living in 2 back rooms at the top of 4 flights of stairs up which william henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing
262,6000-55211-0016.flac,mrs gregory had seated herself now and william henshaw had cleared his throat nervously
263,6000-55211-0046.flac,and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp i am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly i certainly should not have made it had i not had mrs gregory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot
264,6000-55211-0057.flac,we prefer them infinitely to charity oh but please i didn't mean you didn't understand faltered billy for answer alice gregory walked deliberately to the door and held it open oh alice my dear pleaded mrs gregory again feebly
265,6000-55211-0045.flac,billy was wondering which she herself desired more that uncle william should buy the lowest staffed or that he should not she knew she wished mrs gregory to have the hundred dollars there was no doubt on that point then uncle william spoke
266,831-130746-0042.flac,you are safe said mr hoop driver sweeping off his cap with an air of bowing courtly where are we safe but where chit chester harbor he waved his arms seward as though it was a goal do you think they will follow us
267,831-130746-0057.flac,but that night he was in the mood to dare anything so you found your young lady at last said the osler of the red hotel
268,831-130746-0033.flac,his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position the night was a warm white silent safe for the subtle running of their chains
269,831-130746-0037.flac,white dust hot underfoot blinding to the eye is now a soft gray silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence
270,831-130746-0012.flac,another gentleman who another gentleman in brown sir went into the arts or got out the 2 bicycles sir and went off sir about 20 minutes ago beckmill stood with his eyes round and his knuckles on his hips

272,831-130746-0055.flac,almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable a probation in her eyes it was as i have indicated the hour and season of the full moon
273,831-130746-0011.flac,heroes with the fine surprise gone he said with a half laugh gone sir on her bicycle on her bicycle why she went sir with another gentleman this time bekmez was really startled
274,831-130746-0006.flac,it wasn't that 1 at all miss said the osler i'd swear well that's mr bowmont said the barmaid anyhow their conversation hung comatoes in the are switched up by beck mo

276,831-130746-0027.flac,poop driver had cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born had beckmen in the way with rap years for a duel hoop driver had fought as 1 to whom ajin court was a reality and drapery of dream
277,831-130746-0058.flac,wait to misunderstanding said who driver with splendid readiness my sister had gone to bognor but i brought her back here i've took a fancy to this place and the moonlights simply divine we've had supper thanks and we're tired said mr hoop driver
278,831-130746-0017.flac,stephen was too surprised to say anything but bourbon sir go on said beckmill damn you steven sympathies changed at once yes sir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marveling
279,831-130746-0014.flac,then with infinite fervor he said but let us put in blank cartridge he said i might have thought he flung himself into the armchair damn her said beckmill for all the world like a common man
280,831-130746-0050.flac,you would make me your brother miss bowmont yes we could stop there together she took a minute to answer i'm going to light these lamps said hoop driver he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe
281,831-130746-0018.flac,she had evidently gone off with him in that little business was over and he was here stranded and sold
282,831-130746-0045.flac,he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic it's an ugly name he said but you are right in trusting me i would i would do anything for you this
283,831-130746-0039.flac,nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mr hoop driver's skull at the turnings of the road he made his decision with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard the right he would say or again
284,831-130746-0052.flac,who would be hoop driver on a night like this but the christian name christian name my christian name well chris he snapped his lamp and stood up if you'll hold my machine i will light yours he said
285,831-130746-0003.flac,then stephen the waiter who had shown hoop driver up came down and let wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question which that turned 10 minutes into a quarter of an hour and in the midst of this discussion
286,831-130746-0043.flac,we have turned and turned again it seemed to hoop driver that he heard her sob she stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath
287,831-130746-0035.flac,and now they face northwards and the soft cold light passed caressing over her hair and touched her brow and cheek there was a magic quality inn moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden
288,831-130746-0028.flac,it was rescue elopment glory and she by the side of him he had seen her face and shadow
289,831-130746-0002.flac,there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse that made 10 minutes
290,831-130746-0046.flac,promised to help and protect me i was unhappy at home never mind why a stepmother idol unoccupied hindered cramped that is enough perhaps then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire
291,831-130746-0010.flac,if so he was in for an explanation but he had it ready she was a monomaniac leave me alone with her he would say i know how to calm her mrs bowmont said stephen well has gone
292,831-130746-0054.flac,she said with a left to break the intensity he opened his mouth and shut it again and with the sudden wincing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine she looked down at him
293,831-130746-0022.flac,i became mill when with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door steven entered with the bourbon
294,831-130746-0036.flac,it has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy route
295,831-130746-0023.flac,the moonlight ride and so the 20-minute law passed into an infinity
296,831-130746-0031.flac,they scarcely heated with her they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewey knight pale and intricate and high
297,831-130746-0001.flac,that gave the fugitives 5 minutes then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the barmaid what the matter was and the governor being out they spent some more precious time wondering whatever was to be done
298,831-130746-0000.flac,the osler being a full rushed to violently down the road vifer them then he returned panting to the vicuna hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up stopped to give them the cream of the adventure
299,831-130746-0049.flac,what we had best be doing you were tired you know and we can't wander all night after the day we've had that was chit chester we were near she asked if he meditated with a tremble in his voice
300,831-130746-0024.flac,the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vicuna hotel we leave all bognor as we have left all chinchester
301,831-130746-0032.flac,at a footfall at a roughness in the road she seemed to be too intent upon the scape to give much thought to him
302,831-130746-0040.flac,the left as 1 who knew so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea
303,831-130746-0020.flac,knickerbockers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its steps
304,831-130746-0029.flac,he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears but what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon the road turned northward going round through the outskirts of bognor
305,831-130746-0015.flac,i'll check this infernal business they've gone yes sir
306,831-130746-0059.flac,i suppose you won't take anything jesse the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jesse like that but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit good night sis he said and pleasant dreams
307,831-130746-0034.flac,he looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankle gracefully ruling the treadles now the road turned westward and she was a dark gray outline against the shimmer of the moon
308,831-130746-0030.flac,then admits vas again some warm and lamp lit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw a broad 1 meadows shrouded in a low-lying mist
309,831-130746-0026.flac,how their hearts beat together and their breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursued for all that flight mr hoop driver was in the world of romance had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit
310,831-130746-0016.flac,making a memorable saying let them go who cares and i wish him luck and bring me some bourbon as fast as you can there is a good job
311,831-130746-0051.flac,grave and intent how could she ever have thought him common or absurd but you must tell me your name brother she said her carrington said mr hoop driver after a momentary pause
312,831-130746-0041.flac,hello said mr hoop driver saw the voca they dismounted abruptly stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side
313,831-130746-0009.flac,as without knocking steven entered becka mill's face suggested a different expectation big pardon sir said stephen with a diplomatic cough well said beck wandering suddenly if jesse had kept some of her threats
314,831-130746-0007.flac,they listen together his feet stomped turned went out of the dining room down the passage did the bedroom stopped again poor chop said the barmaid she's a wicked woman shh said stephen
315,831-130746-0038.flac,she who was spiritualized the world alone say for 2 attendant steady shining stars and in silence under her benign influence under the benediction of her light rode our 2 wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night
316,831-130746-0044.flac,are you tired he asked i will do what has to be done the 2 black figures in the broken light were silent for a pace do you know she said i'm not afraid of you i am sure you are honest to me
317,831-130746-0060.flac,but this was living indeed he told himself
318,831-130746-0019.flac,and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all that the girl had escaped through her stepmother in which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil our of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed
319,831-130746-0008.flac,after a pause beckham went back to the dining room they heard a chair creek under him interlude of conversational eyebrows i'm going up said stephen to break the melancholy news to him became a looked up from a weak old newspaper
320,831-130746-0004.flac,making a sudden an ostrich and silence appeared beckham in the hull beyond the barre walked with a resolute are to the foot of the staircase and passed out of sight you can see if the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium
321,831-130746-0021.flac,he banged the arms of the chair with his fists and swore again
322,831-130746-0048.flac,i'm entirely at your service i will help you with all my power i've lost an illusion and found a knight errant she spoke of beck mo as the illusion mr hoop driver felt flattered but he had no adequate answer
323,831-130746-0053.flac,the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely she had to speak
324,831-130746-0056.flac,and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converge there upon that chichester was at last detained it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the read hotel still glowed yellow and warm
325,831-130746-0005.flac,incredulous eyes stared into 1 and others in the bar as his paces muffled by the stair carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead
326,831-130746-0047.flac,to be a human being not a thing in a hutch and he i know said hoop driver and now here i am i will do anything said hoop driver she thought you cannot imagine my stepmother know i could not describe her
327,831-130739-0016.flac,it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen even at the cost of some blushes and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story
328,831-130739-0030.flac,of the concussions attended on that person's hasty frequently causeless and invariably ill-conceived dissents 1 large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the apprentice cyclist
329,831-130739-0018.flac,let us assume something of the scientific spirit the heart almost professional tone of the conscientious realist let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest where the unemotional
330,831-130739-0061.flac,hoop driver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it never oil the steering its fatal
331,831-130739-0024.flac,fired by these discoveries and investigator might perhaps have pursued his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders elbows and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story
332,831-130739-0019.flac,and so to our revelation on the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed ladies and gentlemen a contusion and an abrasion on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contusion also
333,831-130739-0008.flac,pair of a kind of dirty fairness grayish eyes and a skimpy immature mustache under his peaked indeterminant nose his features were all small but none ill-shaped a rosette of pins decorated the lapel of his coat
334,831-130739-0029.flac,considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner upon the bicycle saddle and that the ruin estate of the right knee was equally eloquent
335,831-130739-0045.flac,the shop walker brings up parallel to the counter any particular time when you want your holidays he asks hoop driver pulls at his skimpy mustache no don't want them too late sir of course
336,831-130739-0057.flac,carry 1 or 2 lemons with you don't tear yourself to death the first day and sit upright never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity you mind those things and nothing very much can't happen to you hoop driver you take my word
337,831-130739-0026.flac,even in literature 1 must know where to draw the line now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shopman
338,831-130739-0007.flac,now if you would noticed anything about him it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable here were the black morning coat the black tie and the speckled gray nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft
339,831-130739-0042.flac,through the chambers of his brain seeking some nightly quest in honor of that fair lady the last but 1 of the girl apprentices to the dressmaking upstairs
340,831-130739-0034.flac,rice is a vision of a nightly struggle of 2 dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from row hampton to putney hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel
341,831-130739-0043.flac,he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes to the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
342,831-130739-0009.flac,we could show you something better of course no trouble madam i assure you such were the simple counters of his intercourse so i say
343,831-130739-0003.flac,what he might have the pleasure of showing you under certain circumstances as for instance hats baby linen gloves silks lace or curtains
344,831-130739-0054.flac,i'm getting fairly safe opponent now he told miss how at other times hoop driver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity
345,831-130739-0037.flac,to seek the wholesome delight of exertion and danger and pain and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man to which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end
346,831-130739-0059.flac,never let the machine buckle there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling don't scorch don't ride on the footpath keep your own side of the road and if you see a tram line go around the corner at once and hurry off into the next county
347,831-130739-0052.flac,said hoop driver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient mustache
348,831-130739-0028.flac,would have fancied nothing of the kind
349,831-130739-0001.flac,a perfectly fictitious coat by the buy of putney on the 14th of august 1895 had turned to the right hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend
350,831-130739-0038.flac,but enough of these revelations the central fear of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be packed by the senior porter and sent to you
351,831-130739-0056.flac,was setting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark briggs had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt hoop drivers inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him have the machine thoroughly well oiled said briggs
352,831-130739-0055.flac,when the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and a very big place and studying a road map of the south of england
353,831-130739-0015.flac,but real literature as distinguished from anecdote does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone literature is revelation modern literature is indecorous revelation
354,831-130739-0014.flac,1 glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilities at work all about you
355,831-130739-0020.flac,on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise on his left chin there were 2 bruises 1 a lead and yellow graduating here and there into purple and another obviously of a more recent date of a blotchy red
356,831-130739-0017.flac,the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was let us face it bravely the remarkable condition of this young man's legs let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness
357,831-130739-0033.flac,until sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old-fashioned affair with a fork instead of a diamond frame a cushioned tire well worn on the hind wheel
358,831-130739-0048.flac,all drapers have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you the decision comes at last
359,831-130739-0062.flac,a voice that came from around a fitful glow of light was saying and claim the chain daily with black lead you mind just a few little things like that
360,831-130739-0012.flac,sign then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view
361,831-130739-0021.flac,tumid and threatening proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner an unnatural hardness and reddish would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf
362,831-130739-0046.flac,how about this day week hoop driver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the corners of his gingham folds in his hands his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations can he learn it in a week that's the question
363,831-130739-0053.flac,you stow it said mr hoop driver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt
364,831-130739-0058.flac,safe perhaps for a curse or so what is pipe and then break out with an entirely different set of tips void running over dogs who driver whatever you do
365,831-130739-0022.flac,and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points
366,831-130739-0010.flac,he would have danced a boat behind the counter have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you have put on 1 side those you selected extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tin foil sheet from a fixture
367,831-130739-0023.flac,the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvelous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee so far we may proceed with our details
368,831-130739-0031.flac,for upon every 1 of them waits the just of the unexpected treadle you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and a whack you are rubbing your shin so out of innocence we ripen
369,831-130739-0027.flac,1 might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a threshing machine say or 1 of those haymaking furies but sherlock holmes

426,1963-142393-0011.flac,and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn but what harm could he do by going to snowfield dina could not be displeased with him for it
427,1963-142393-0034.flac,that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky had a milder more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day adam stouts and fears melted under this influence
428,1963-142393-0030.flac,i've always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me
429,1963-142393-0004.flac,towards the middle of october the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion the weeks were unusually long dynamis surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind
430,1963-142393-0031.flac,when you can't look to them nearest to you to help you with a bit better thought
431,1963-142393-0002.flac,she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while and i've no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes she's told me what her mind is and she's not a woman to say 1 thing and mean another
432,1963-142393-0026.flac,so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away his love for dina was better and more precious to him for it was the algorithm of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow
433,1963-142393-0016.flac,this morning brought with him new thoughts through the gray country thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past that is a base
434,1963-142393-0018.flac,adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank god for another's misery and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy and adam's behalf
435,1963-142393-0045.flac,she was much longer coming than he expected he waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer at last he saw the little black figure
436,1963-142393-0046.flac,coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill slowly adam thought but dena was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step
437,1963-142393-0053.flac,what was in her mind she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual munitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice but the second time she looked round
438,1963-142393-0041.flac,the little gray desolate looking hamlet unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn
439,1963-142393-0009.flac,and he thought he must write himself he must ask dina not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful he sat up late 1 night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect
440,1963-142393-0017.flac,and selfish even the blasphemous spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that is blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves
441,1963-142393-0050.flac,and adam rose from the stonewall it happened that just as he walked forward dina had paused and turned round to look back at the village
442,1963-142393-0036.flac,he did not expect de to be at home at this hour but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate
443,1963-142393-0033.flac,october sunshine then it had in the eager time of early spring and the 1 grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions
444,1963-142393-0032.flac,with adam came inside of the grey town on the hillside and looked searchingly toward the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill the scene looked less harsh in the soft
445,1963-142393-0021.flac,which is sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible
446,1963-142393-0008.flac,if she had not felt this she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him as adam's confidence waned his patience waned with it
447,1963-142393-0054.flac,what a look of yearning love it was that the mild gray eyes turned on the strong dark eyed man she did not start again at the side of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp around
448,1963-142393-0007.flac,would have 2 stronger grasp upon her
449,1963-142393-0028.flac,for she's better than i am
450,1963-142393-0039.flac,so adam got on his horse again and rode to the town putting up at the old in and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the 2 ch landers
451,1963-142393-0006.flac,but that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us adam was no longer so confident as he had been he began to fear that perhaps dina's old life
452,1963-142393-0055.flac,and they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell adam was content and said nothing it was dina who spoke first adam she said it is the divine will
453,1963-142393-0024.flac,something like this sense of enlarged being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past
454,1963-142393-0003.flac,i'll wait patiently that was adam's wise resolution and it throws excellently for the first 2 or 3 weeks on the nourishment it got
455,1963-142393-0015.flac,the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time or rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters and adam
456,1963-142393-0027.flac,it's like as if it was a new strength to me he said to himself to love her and know if she loves me
457,1963-142393-0020.flac,by ramping it up in other words other folks were not created for my sake that i should think all square when things turn out well for me but it is not a noble to feel that the fuller life
458,1963-142393-0044.flac,because it was a way from all eyes no house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep near no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky
459,1963-142393-0022.flac,by which is dim board site of man as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and the fulgent day the growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty
460,1963-142393-0025.flac,the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point toward which that hard journey from snowfield 18 months ago had been leading him tender and deep as his love for hadi had been
461,1963-142393-0040.flac,he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards loman's end with all his haste it was nearly 4:00 before he could set off
462,1963-142393-0057.flac,to bear and do our heavenly father's will that i had lost before adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes then we'll never part any more dina till death parts us and they kissed each other
463,1963-142393-0029.flac,as if you could walk more fearless when you've more trust in another
464,1963-142393-0037.flac,he had set his mind on following her and bringing her home she was gone to sloan's end a hamlet about 3 miles off over the hill the old woman told him
465,1963-142393-0051.flac,adam was glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him he came within 3 paces of her and then said dina
466,1963-142393-0001.flac,i wish i'd asked her to write to me though he thought and yet
467,1963-142393-0052.flac,she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place dina adam said again
468,1963-142393-0019.flac,i should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said evil's evil and sorrow sorrow
469,1963-142393-0035.flac,as the delicate web like clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him seemed to c dina's gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know
470,1963-142393-0005.flac,he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first drop that she offers him to care much about the taste of the second he treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties
471,1963-142393-0023.flac,we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or a philosopher to his less complete formula
472,1963-142393-0038.flac,preaching a cottage there as her habit was
473,1963-142393-0042.flac,perhaps that's the last him before they come away adam thought i'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again
474,1963-142393-0047.flac,now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill but adam would not move yet he would not meet her too soon he had set his heart on meeting her and this assured loneliness and now he began to fear
475,1963-142393-0014.flac,he had often been to oakburn and back since that first journey to snowfield but beyond oakburn the greystone walls the broken country the meager trees seem to be telling him a fresh
476,1963-142393-0013.flac,that he was already on his way to snowfield on horseback this time for his hours were precious now and he had borrowed jonathan burg's good nag for the journey what king memories went along the road with him
477,1963-142393-0056.flac,my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you and this moment now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love i have a fullness of strength
478,1963-142393-0000.flac,adam understood dina's haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it
479,1963-142393-0012.flac,she had not forbidden him to go she must surely expect that he would go before long by the second sunday in october
480,1963-142393-0010.flac,it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips for her presence reconciled him to her will you perceive how it was adam was hungering for the sight of dina
481,1963-142393-0048.flac,lest he should startle her too much yet he thought she's not 1 to be over startled she's always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill
482,1963-142393-0049.flac,perhaps she had found complete repose without him and had ceased to feel any need of his love on the verge of a decision we all tremble hope pauses with fluttering wings but now at last she was very near
483,1963-147036-0023.flac,noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood so you were the cyclist at he said that's right said milbur it is an exercise to which i am very partial what do you want to ask tarling alert and watchful
484,1963-147036-0001.flac,you he said again and walked towards her he held out his hand and she gave him the wallet without a word sit down he said kindly he thought she was going to faint i hope i didn't hurt you i hadn't the slightest idea
485,1963-147036-0032.flac,tarling step back he saw the malicious little smile on milbur face and could have struck him down miss ryder does not wish me to see what is in this case he said
486,1963-147036-0006.flac,i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet she said listen listen but i was not on the bicycle who was it he asked she shook her head may i have that please
487,1963-147036-0019.flac,i'm afraid oh i'm afraid he crushed her in his arms his cheek against hers his lips tingling with the caress of her hair but there's nothing to be afraid of nothing he said eagerly if you were as guilty as hell i would save you
488,1963-147036-0033.flac,here it was the girl's voice surprisingly clear and steady her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it towards the detective there is a reason she said in a low voice
489,1963-147036-0014.flac,her head was still bent and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible tell you what she asked what you know of this business he said don't you realize how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion
490,1963-147036-0020.flac,if you were shielding somebody i would shield them because i love you odette no no she cried and pushed him back both her little hands pressing against his chest don't ask me don't ask me ask me darling swung round
491,1963-147036-0018.flac,odette odette he whispered don't you realize that i love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness won't you tell me everything please no no no she murmured with a little catch in her voice please don't ask me
492,1963-147036-0035.flac,good god he muttered in red on
493,1963-147036-0005.flac,she looked up at his words i on the bicycle she asked no it was not i not you she shook her head i was in the grounds
494,1963-147036-0021.flac,there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him milbur he said between his teeth milbur smiled the other mockingly i'm sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene
495,1963-147036-0027.flac,but it was an uneasy smile i make no accusation he said
496,1963-147036-0004.flac,it struck him at that moment that it was not an offence for odette ryder to go up to her mother's house on a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers if there was any crime at all
497,1963-147036-0024.flac,i want you to carry out your promise mr tarling said milbur smoothly tarling stared at him my promise he said what promise to protect not only the evildoer
498,1963-147036-0026.flac,and that you have it in your power to get us safely out of this country to 1 where extradition laws cannot follow darling took 1 step towards him and milbur shrank back do you accuse miss ryder of complicity in this murder he demanded milbur smiled
499,1963-147036-0034.flac,melbourne had gone too far tarling saw his face lengthened and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes then without further hesitation he opened the paper in read the first line took away his breath the confession of odette ryder
500,1963-147036-0012.flac,oh that
501,1963-147036-0028.flac,he shrugged his shoulders you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which i was endeavoring to remove to a place of safety tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it i shall see the contents of this wallet tomorrow he said
502,1963-147036-0010.flac,he had no more idea that he did love her than whiteside would have had yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips the effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him

535,1926-147979-0032.flac,he seemed to know that it must be done with the fingers and that with the fists or the feet he approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct and coupled himself to it as if he knew it was to piece him out and make a whole creature of him
536,1926-147979-0005.flac,for mrs gardner had gone to omaha for a week johnny had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent minded it was mrs gardiner who ran the business and looked after everything her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travelers

548,1926-147979-0011.flac,a drug man and willie o'reilly who traveled for a jewelry house and sold musical instruments the talk was all about good and bad hotels actors and actresses and musical proteges i learned that mrs garner had gone to omaha to hear booth and barrett
549,1926-147979-0025.flac,and went towards the window she saw this hideous little pick and any dressed in an old piece of sacking standing in the open space between the hollyhawk rose his body rocking automatically his blind face lifted
550,1926-147979-0031.flac,it was cold and hard and like nothing else in his black universe he went back to its mouth began at 1 end of the keyboard and felt his way down into the mellow thunder as far as he could go
551,1926-147979-0001.flac,but in blackhawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pitched frozen down to the bare stock
552,1926-147979-0018.flac,well the mulatto sat rocking himself his head thrown back his yellow face lifted it shriveled eyelids never fluttering he was born in the far south on the do plantation where the spirit if not the fact of slavery persisted
553,1926-147979-0010.flac,he was a dapper little irish man very vain homely as a monkey with friends everywhere and a sweetheart in every port like a sailor i did not know all the men who were sitting about but i recognized a furniture salesman from kansas city
554,1926-147979-0017.flac,now gentlemen i expect you've all got grand voices seems like we might have some good old plantation songs tonight the men gathered around him as he began to play my old kentucky home they sang 1 ngo melody after another
555,1926-147979-0038.flac,and he were gloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers in the middle of a crashing walts darnos suddenly began to play softly and turning to 1 of the men who stood behind him whispered
556,1926-147979-0027.flac,talk a little while and then leave the room he heard the door close after them he crept up the front windows and stuck his head in there was no 1 there he could always detect the presence of anyone in a room
557,1926-147979-0004.flac,the wind from without made waves in the long carpet a coal stove glowed at either end of the room and the grand piano in the middle stood open there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night
558,1926-147979-0016.flac,when he was sitting or standing still he swayed back and forth incessantly like a rocking toy at the piano he swayed in time to the music and when he was not playing his body kept up this motion like an empty mill grinding on
559,1926-147979-0047.flac,over the piano and began to draw the dance music out of it while the perspiration shone on his short wool and on his uplifted face
560,1926-147979-0048.flac,whenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath he would boom out softly who's that going back on me 1 of these city gentlemen i bet now you girls
561,1926-147979-0008.flac,guests felt that they were receiving not conferring a favor when they stayed at her house even the smartest travelling men were flattered when mrs gardner stopped to chat with them for a moment
562,1926-147979-0020.flac,his mother a buxom young negro wench who was a landress for the donos concluded that her blind baby was not right in his head and she was ashamed of him she loved him devotedly but he was so ugly with his sunken eyes and his fidgets
563,1926-147979-0040.flac,springing down he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining room tiny and lena antonia and mary dusk were walting in the middle of the floor they separated and fled towards the kitchen giggling kirkpatrick caught tiny by the elbows
564,1926-147979-0037.flac,as piano playing it was perhaps abominable but as music it was something real vitalized by a sense of rhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses that not only filled his dark mind but worried his body incessantly
565,1926-147979-0000.flac,winter lies too long in country towns hangs on until it is stale and shabby old and solid on the farm the weather was the great fact and the men's affairs went on underneath it as the steams creep under the ice
566,1926-147979-0014.flac,we going to have a little music some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening it was the soft amiable negro voice like those i remembered from early childhood with the note of docile subservience in it
567,1926-147979-0046.flac,and on its watch case doubtless on his heart too he was an affectionate little man and he thought his wife a wonderful woman he knew that without her he would hardly be more than a clerk in some other man's hotel at a word from kpatrick
568,1926-147979-0024.flac,whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin she whipped him unmercifully and told him what dreadful things old mr darno would do to him if he ever found him near the big house but the next time samson had a chance he ran away again
569,1926-147979-0041.flac,what's the matter with you girls dancing out here by yourselves when there's a room full of lonesome men on the other side of the partition introduced me to your friends tiny the girls still laughing we're trying to escape tiny looked alarmed
570,1926-147979-0009.flac,2 classes those who had seen mrs gardner's diamonds and those who had not when i stole into the parlor incurred patrick marshall fields man
571,1926-147979-0019.flac,when he was 3 weeks old he had an illness which left him totally blind
572,1926-147979-0026.flac,though it did not occur to her that he might have more of it than other children 1 day samson was standing thus while miss nellie was playing her lesson to her music master the windows were open
573,1926-143879-0006.flac,grave she found herself and positively more weighted as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world
574,1926-143879-0009.flac,with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted
575,1926-143879-0039.flac,and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain
576,1926-143879-0023.flac,but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti-climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabelle's silence about mr osband for instance
577,1926-143879-0038.flac,an occasional lapse from kandare in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception
578,1926-143879-0040.flac,advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it's so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend
579,1926-143879-0036.flac,a consummation the more desirable
580,1926-143879-0035.flac,her character had revealed itself
581,1926-143879-0041.flac,but it stood for a high water mark in the e and flow of confidence had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less
582,1926-143879-0034.flac,isabelle found much to interest her in these countries though madame morale continued to remark that even among the most classic sites
583,1926-143879-0045.flac,during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame morale in whose house she had gone to lodge i mean it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came
584,1926-143879-0015.flac,mrs lelo sacrificed as i say to paris it had doubts and wondermints not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further shagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations
585,1926-143879-0042.flac,a stationary affection in other words with impossible it must move 1 way or the other however that might be the girl head in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been
586,1926-143879-0016.flac,mrs lelo's mental motions were sufficiently various
587,1926-143879-0033.flac,but she added that she herself had always been consumed with a desire to visit athens and constantinople the 2 ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent 3 months in greece in turkey in egypt
588,1926-143879-0022.flac,then that she didn't wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice than she would have been to close that rare volume forever
589,1926-143879-0001.flac,our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late springtime shortly after her return to the plaza crescentini
590,1926-143879-0043.flac,i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo where as she stood among the broken columns at the acropolis or fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the straight of salamis
591,1926-143879-0025.flac,it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabelle watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews
592,1926-143879-0020.flac,the trophies lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this is exactly what she had expected of isabelle to give it form and body
593,1926-143879-0013.flac,and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and childrens on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshiped
594,1926-143879-0007.flac,a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at garden court a couple of years before
595,1926-143879-0029.flac,she made her way down to rome without touching it florence
596,1926-143879-0004.flac,2 troubled for attention she moved in a vein circle
597,1926-143879-0000.flac,chapter 31 isabelle came back to florence but only after several months an interval sufficiently replete with incident it is not however during this interval that we are closely concerned with her
598,1926-143879-0017.flac,which had an elegant conservatory and was just around the corner from her own at another
599,1926-143879-0011.flac,the little love those had not yet even from the american point of view
600,1926-143879-0005.flac,since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always rained she wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do
601,1926-143879-0037.flac,she considered with a presumption of youth that immorality differing from her own must be inferior to it
602,1926-143879-0014.flac,and was costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabelle who in these days made
603,1926-143879-0002.flac,to social uses and there was that in her expression and attitude
604,1926-143879-0008.flac,if your thoughts just now had incline themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present
605,1926-143879-0028.flac,set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets the moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark
606,1926-143879-0027.flac,and houston square with a long way from pickodeli but isabelle performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily
607,1926-143879-0024.flac,was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to mrs lelo that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating and incident as inheriting a fortune
608,1926-143879-0021.flac,we know ourselves that isabelle had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have affected in her native land
609,1926-143879-0012.flac,lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows
610,1926-143879-0030.flac,in the september previous had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer
611,1926-143879-0019.flac,isabelle had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lily's understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides
612,1926-143879-0046.flac,and went to pay a visit at palazo cresant madame raw on this occasion remaining in rome
613,1926-143879-0032.flac,had not been a fortnite in rome before she proposed to madame morale that they should take a little pilgrimage to the east madame mural remarked that her friend was restless
614,1926-143879-0003.flac,the tall window was open and though its green shutters were partially drawn the bright are of the garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with warmth
615,1926-143879-0031.flac,and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mr bantling that he would soon come over
616,1926-143879-0026.flac,the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in street lamps in the thick brown are looked weak and red
617,1926-143879-0018.flac,on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities
618,1926-143879-0044.flac,deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival
619,1926-143879-0010.flac,she had left her husband behind her but it brought her children to isabelle now played with equal municipal and tenderness the part of maiden aunt mr ledlow
620,1926-147987-0001.flac,she hesitated and then told us how strangely mr qatar had behaved before he went away
621,1926-147987-0023.flac,she and her husband had started home from omaha to gather the morning before they had to stop over several hours and way more junction to catch the blackhawk train
622,1926-147987-0002.flac,as he had just put a new yale lock on the front door qatar had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone
623,1926-147987-0011.flac,where is she under the bed are you hussy i know your tricks wait till i get at you i'll fix this rat you've got in here he's caught all right so long as qatar had me by the throat there was no chance for me at all
624,1926-147987-0016.flac,she spent the whole morning bathing and pulled to sing me and rubbing me with arnica i heard antonia sobbing outside my door but i asked grandmother to send her away i felt that i never wanted to see her again
625,1926-147987-0025.flac,she saw him slip a twenty-dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket that bill she said should have aroused her suspicions at once but did not the trains are never called at little junction towns everybody knows when they come in
626,1926-147987-0015.flac,she seemed to understand though i was too faint and miserable to go into explanations when she took
627,1926-147987-0007.flac,the third night i spent at the cutters i woke suddenly with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut everything was still however and i must have gone to sleep again immediately
628,1926-147987-0009.flac,i held my breath in late absolutely still a hand closed softly on my shoulder and at the same moment i felt something hairy and clone scented brushing my face
629,1926-147987-0027.flac,and the cutter must have planned it so the conductor told her the blackhawk train was due at way more 12 minutes after the kansas city train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to blackhawk without her
630,1926-147987-0017.flac,she had let me in for all this disgustingness grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antonia but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude
631,1926-147987-0026.flac,mr cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off
632,1926-147987-0028.flac,she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any 1 of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omaha hotel
633,1926-147987-0031.flac,then from any experiences of his own his zest and debauchery might wane but never mrs cutter's belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on
634,1926-147987-0014.flac,and 1 eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have a doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her
635,1926-147987-0012.flac,when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to do anything about it i found a shaw and an overcoat on the hat rack laid down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep
636,1926-147987-0005.flac,maybe jim would be willing to go over there and sleep and you could come here nights i'd feel safer knowing you were under my own roof i guess jim could take care of the silver and old ussery notes as well as you could
637,1926-147987-0004.flac,grandmother was apprehensive at once i don't think it's right for you to stay there feeling that way i suppose it wouldn't be right for you to leave the place alone either
638,1926-147987-0024.flac,when he returned he told her that he would have to stay overnight there
639,1926-147987-0000.flac,the day after the cutters left antenna came over to cs grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted you've got something on your mind antinea she said anxiously
640,1926-147987-0019.flac,and had left again on the 6:00 train for denver that morning the agent said his face was striped with court plaster and he carried his left hand in a sling he looked so used up that the agent asked him what had happened to him since 10:00 the night before
641,1926-147987-0013.flac,her cry of freight awakened me truly i was a battered object as she helped me to my room i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my lip was cut and stood out like a snout my nose looked like a big blue plum
642,1926-147987-0008.flac,i was only half awake but i decided that he might take the cutter silver whoever he was
643,1926-147987-0010.flac,the man became insane he stood over me choking me with 1 so this is what she's up to when i'm away is it where is she you nasty well
644,1926-147987-0006.flac,anthony had turned to me eagerly oh would you jim
645,1926-147987-0018.flac,if the story once got abroad i would never hear the last of it i could well imagine what the old man down at the drugstore would do with such a theme
646,1926-147987-0020.flac,my own garments have been treated so badly that i never saw them again grandmother burned them in the cutters kitchen range while antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it the front doorbell rang violently
647,1926-147987-0021.flac,there stood mrs cutter locked out for she had no key to the new lock her head trembling with rage i advised her to control herself or she would have a stroke grandmother said afterwards
648,1926-147987-0029.flac,but apparently it was part of his fund to outrage her feelings as much as possible mr cutter will pay for this mrs burton he will pay mrs cutter ev vowed nodding her horse-like head and rolling her eyes
649,1926-147987-0030.flac,certainly cutter like to have his wife think him a devil in some way he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her hysterical nature perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement
650,1926-147987-0003.flac,or the way he looked at her i feel as if he's up to some of his tricks again
651,1926-147987-0022.flac,engineer was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told mrs cutter it would be useless to are interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then mrs cutter told her story
652,7780-274562-0057.flac,of human loveliness do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as a gladdens our daily path byron who often aired aired not in saying i've seen more living beauty
653,7780-274562-0022.flac,at the decree finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison upon his 21st birthday
654,7780-274562-0001.flac,giles fletcher no more remarkable man ever lived the my friend the young ellison he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune
655,7780-274562-0051.flac,it's adaptation to the eyes which were to be holded upon earth in his explanation of this phraseology mr ellison did much toward solving what has always seemed to me an enigma i mean the fact
656,7780-274562-0069.flac,it is easily understood that mr ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time enter a general and more distantly observed effect
657,7780-274562-0040.flac,it may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen in that
658,7780-274562-0031.flac,6 and 20 for every minute that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to imagine
659,7780-274562-0070.flac,he spoke upon this topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious important which is little
660,7780-274562-0060.flac,for the feeling is no affectation or shimmer the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrators than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist he not only believes
661,7780-274562-0026.flac,it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigue or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility
662,7780-274562-0013.flac,and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox hunter his second principle was the love of woman
663,7780-274562-0019.flac,allison this gentleman had amassed a princely fortune and having no very immediate connections conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his deceased

665,7780-274562-0065.flac,each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical inundation i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations loan is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that
666,7780-274562-0023.flac,from entering into possession as the heir of his ancestor sebrite of a fortune of
667,7780-274562-0101.flac,then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature and nature which is not god nor an emanation of god
668,7780-274562-0024.flac,there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic
669,7780-274562-0084.flac,that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities then in the creation of any special wanderers or miracles
670,7780-274562-0003.flac,the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of to grow price priestly and condors of exemplifying by individual instance
671,7780-274562-0053.flac,while the component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short no position can be attained
672,7780-274562-0027.flac,or devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large specimens of virtue or playing the munificent patron of letters in art or in dowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity
673,7780-274562-0073.flac,to have well treated this theme there are properly he writes but 2 styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial
674,7780-274562-0085.flac,is a proposition better suited to the gravelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervent dreams of the man of genius the merit suggested is at best negative
675,7780-274562-0088.flac,rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance to the virtues which deny or refrain beyond these the critical art can but suggest
676,7780-274562-0004.flac,what has been deemed the mere shimmer of the perfectionists in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma that in man's physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principal
677,7780-274562-0095.flac,yet which if attained will lend a charm to the landscape garden and measurably surpassing that which in merely human interests could bestow
678,7780-274562-0056.flac,the criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points
679,7780-274562-0076.flac,in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order that in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify
680,7780-274562-0063.flac,in his instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his computers let a composition be defective let an invitation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form
681,7780-274562-0029.flac,and figures but suffice to confound it was seen that even at 3% the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than 13 million and 00000
682,7780-274562-0059.flac,it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art having i say felt its truth here
683,7780-274562-0028.flac,but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to figures
684,7780-274562-0002.flac,from his cradle to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere worldly or external sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness
685,7780-274562-0009.flac,experience mr ellison would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments
686,7780-274562-0082.flac,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities
687,7780-274562-0054.flac,from which an artistical i looking steadily will not find matter of offense in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is this
688,7780-274562-0090.flac,such as that of keats or the sensitive plant of shelly but the thing done
689,7780-274562-0100.flac,definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or super intendance on the part of intelligence and superior yet akin to humanity
690,7780-274562-0096.flac,so imbue his designs at once with extent novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in bringing about such results
691,7780-274562-0017.flac,his possessions had been always ample but upon the attainment of his 1 in 20th year it was discovered that 1 of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startled the whole social world and made which they occur
692,7780-274562-0078.flac,which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening
693,7780-274562-0097.flac,he secures all the advantages of interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art
694,7780-274562-0000.flac,the azure fields of heaven were assembled right in a large round set with flowers of light the flowers deloose in the round sparks of dew that hung upon their azure leaves did show like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue
695,7780-274562-0061.flac,but positively knows that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form constitute and alone constitute the true beauty
696,7780-274562-0007.flac,it is not impossible that man the individual under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued
697,7780-274562-0098.flac,in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is a parent the art of a creator yet is this art apparently to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling
698,7780-274562-0047.flac,here was indeed the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty
699,7780-274562-0066.flac,therefore her susceptibility of improvement
700,7780-274562-0055.flac,in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the color of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley
701,7780-274562-0102.flac,in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hovered between man and god it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this
702,7780-274562-0099.flac,now if we imagine the sense of the almighty designed to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape who is combined strangeness vastness
703,7780-274562-0032.flac,enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance i was not surprised however
704,7780-274562-0025.flac,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any 1 of a thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen
705,7780-274562-0034.flac,the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some peculiarities either in his early education
706,7780-274562-0083.flac,what is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much or little or nothing
707,7780-274562-0052.flac,which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combinations of scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce
708,7780-274562-0043.flac,under other circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become a painter the field of sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical
709,7780-274562-0075.flac,detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color witch hidden from the common observer a revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of a natural style of gardening
710,7780-274562-0077.flac,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english style
711,7780-274562-0071.flac,or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class of beings human wants but now to humanity invisible
712,7780-274562-0008.flac,and thus is especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconceived it is indeed evident
713,7780-274562-0037.flac,was to be found in the creation of novel moves of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he came neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term and it's every day acceptation
714,7780-274562-0105.flac,that ellison thought to find and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity
715,7780-274562-0074.flac,1 seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees and harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land
716,7780-274562-0038.flac,or it might have been that he became neither the 1 nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his which i have already mentioned the idea that in the contempt of ambition lay 1 of the essential principles of happiness on earth
717,7780-274562-0087.flac,and pills directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes in flames and invention or creation can be apprehended solely and its results
718,7780-274562-0044.flac,with 2 limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied at any time much of his attention and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which
719,7780-274562-0067.flac,it was mr ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty
720,7780-274562-0045.flac,even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of exi i mean the most liberal public and recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment
721,7780-274562-0064.flac,let this inundation be submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity be admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective composition
722,7780-274562-0021.flac,many futile attempts have been made to set aside the singular request their ex post facto character rendered them abortive
723,7780-274562-0012.flac,attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name he pointed to the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class are proverbially more happy than others
724,7780-274562-0016.flac,his intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition his family was 1 of the most illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women
725,7780-274562-0018.flac,and seldom fell radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it appears that about 100 years prior to mr ellison's attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province
726,7780-274562-0093.flac,are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so
727,7780-274562-0039.flac,is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above that which is terminate mission
728,7780-274562-0042.flac,of which the human nature is absolutely capable mr ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse
729,7780-274562-0048.flac,the elements which should enter into combination being at all times and by vast superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in the multi form of the tree
730,7780-274562-0020.flac,my newly installed the various modes of investment he bickwit the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the end of a 100 years
731,7780-274562-0011.flac,or rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical 1 of free exercise in the open air the health he said
732,7780-274562-0036.flac,and it was this bias perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment
733,7780-274562-0072.flac,for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful more especially than for our own had been set in order by god the great landscape garden of the whole earth in the course of our discussion
734,7780-274562-0035.flac,or in the nature of his intellect
735,7780-274562-0104.flac,in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect and lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife
736,7780-274562-0058.flac,ripe and real then all the nonsense of their stone ideal and landscape alone is the principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here
737,7780-274562-0103.flac,and the free exercise in the open air which resulted from personal direction of his plans and the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford
738,7780-274562-0050.flac,he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfillment of his destiny as poet
739,7780-274562-0062.flac,yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them
740,7780-274562-0049.flac,and then the multicolored of the flower he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness and in the direction or concentration of this effort or
741,7780-274562-0068.flac,that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly affect a blemish in the picture if we could depose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens
742,7780-274562-0080.flac,calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed their in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest
743,7780-274562-0033.flac,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision in the widest and noblesse sense he was a poet he comprehended war over the true character the august aims
744,7780-274562-0081.flac,from what i have already observed said mr ellison you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country
745,7780-274562-0089.flac,you may be instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a tempest and inferno a prometheus bound a knighting gal
746,7780-274562-0079.flac,a mixture of pure art in the garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral a terrace
747,7780-274562-0091.flac,the softest of the negative school who through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what
748,7780-274562-0086.flac,and app pertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate addison into apotheosis in truth
749,7780-274562-0015.flac,i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men
750,7780-274562-0005.flac,the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of his career has taught me to understand that in general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind
751,2518-154825-0006.flac,but i will put a curci frown and while i wrap it listen to how we lie and then choose what we shall do i nodded biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me and he went on

754,2518-154825-0038.flac,putting my arms around his neck and so he bore me pick a back i shut my eyes for him again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
755,2518-154825-0024.flac,we have 15 minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the clifftop in that time we shall have an hour's start or more for they will take all that to search the undercliffe and msq 2

765,2518-154825-0034.flac,but spent much time that was so precious and traveling those 10 yards to take me around the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me furious pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elvir and he
766,2518-154825-0055.flac,and i could open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands and knees and elves
767,2518-154825-0036.flac,but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
768,2518-154825-0010.flac,and they will take the alive and then there is a dance on are at dorchester jail i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a violent
769,2518-154825-0046.flac,like setting gear modes against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
770,2518-154825-0015.flac,i never heard but 1 had climbed it and that was lander jordan when the excise was on his heels half a century back but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot and the wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight
771,2518-154825-0033.flac,for there is no room to dance horn pipes here and hold the eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither down nor seward it was well he told me what to do and well i did it
772,2518-154825-0002.flac,and was only shooting at a venture we were safe but for how short a time safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us
773,2518-154825-0051.flac,move thou must and his better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in the later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him
774,2518-154825-0030.flac,and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elae went slower and slower to at last he spoke john i am going to stop
775,2518-154825-0035.flac,forgetting what i suffered cried out quick and thy pace lad if thou canst the time is short now so frail is man's temper that though he was doing more than any ever did to save another's life and was all i had to trust you in the world yet
776,2518-154825-0032.flac,the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff
777,2518-154825-0018.flac,is better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hail us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with broken leg
778,2518-154825-0040.flac,i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the goals wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
779,2518-154825-0047.flac,thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elves of your pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton
780,2518-154825-0050.flac,there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are lost pluck up like courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot
781,2518-154825-0053.flac,so he gave it up leave and go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the undercliffe blow a sound of voices and shouting zones they are down already cried elvir and have found my excuse body
782,2518-154825-0029.flac,thus he went on for a time that seemed without end and yet was really but a minute or 2 and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive it all on the undercliffe blow fresher and cold on the cliff side
783,2518-154825-0042.flac,and how he did it in such a narrow straight i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight
784,2518-154825-0003.flac,safe with a discharged pistol in our grass and a shot man lying at our feet elave was the first to speak can you stand john is the bone broken
785,2518-154825-0012.flac,there is yet another way that we may try and if thou hast but 2 whole legs i would have tried it and now it is a little short of madness and yet if thou fierce not i will still try it
786,2518-154825-0037.flac,and then while he knelt down upon the path
787,2518-154825-0026.flac,so shut their eyes and keep them tight until i bid the open them with that he cut me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint-hearted and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
788,2518-154825-0052.flac,now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elae for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path
789,2518-154825-0031.flac,but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again
790,2518-154825-0045.flac,and in 5 more they will be on the undercliffe and if we ever reach the top who knows but they have left a guard know no they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag and if they knew
791,2518-154825-0049.flac,i knew that it was moving a little tough so bent grass and the chiding cries of the goal seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off onto the rocks below then elves of your spoke john he said
792,2518-154825-0028.flac,and not a man in all the world to do it with a full ground ladd in his arms yet elave made no bones of it nor spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot
793,2518-154825-0019.flac,and a threat of blood that welled up from it and trickled off onto the sword it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the undercliff
794,2518-154825-0014.flac,where the undercliff dies back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it and of men
795,2518-154825-0000.flac,how fearful and dizzy it is to cast 1 eyes so low i'll look no more
796,2518-154825-0048.flac,i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes
797,2518-154825-0013.flac,just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridal path leads down but not a 100 yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts
798,2518-154825-0043.flac,i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint
799,2518-154825-0025.flac,we'll keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning
800,2518-154825-0021.flac,for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a wider thread against the gray white cliff face
801,2518-154825-0054.flac,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below alfred a falling left me in a moment
802,2518-154825-0023.flac,and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and his too late now to change counsel
803,2518-154825-0044.flac,so i gave out 1 2 3 and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself those words seemed thin and far off we must have taken 10 minutes to get here
804,2518-154825-0020.flac,and was a task that might cow the bravest and when i looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posi then set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below
805,2518-154825-0016.flac,yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry these some way and where there is no room to carry
806,2518-154825-0011.flac,so only gave a sigh wishing heartily that msq were not dead and that my leg were not broke but that i was back again at the why not or even hearing 1 of dr sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlor
807,2518-154825-0009.flac,and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me ways to charge an air so 1 thing we can do is to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg
808,2518-154826-0001.flac,with the straight sun path across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief of being once more infirm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain it made me forget that my leg was broken
809,2518-154826-0003.flac,and i felt a thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second
810,2518-154826-0034.flac,and so i said as much to elae who only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough
811,2518-154826-0009.flac,that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elvir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
812,2518-154826-0044.flac,though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peering out at the top of the mound there were many tumbled down walls and though gables left at the cottages of the old quarrymen grass-covered ridges marked out the little garden folds
813,2518-154826-0026.flac,but elae passed him the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer top was the answer
814,2518-154826-0035.flac,but when elvir sat down the boy gave a careful look around and seeing no 1 watching anymore
815,2518-154826-0041.flac,and i'm told in other parts of england as well in the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned a skew till you reach 50 70 or perhaps 100 ft deep then
816,2518-154826-0020.flac,then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sword was felt accounting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up 30 little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
817,2518-154826-0018.flac,and now that i was under the lee of the wall
818,2518-154826-0038.flac,and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more and dangling when we started again
819,2518-154826-0015.flac,so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou can look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see ought moving wake me up
820,2518-154826-0037.flac,we must have slept 3 hours or more for thou art but of sorry watchmen john it is 1 of the century sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posy might have had us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with the lusty stride
821,2518-154826-0029.flac,and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
822,2518-154826-0048.flac,and the sword crept over the edges of the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrow the steps
823,2518-154826-0042.flac,from the bottom of the shaft they're spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly 6 feet high but sometimes only 3 or 4 and in these the marble is doug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves
824,2518-154826-0040.flac,although i kne little of these queries and certainly was an evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learned much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbeck marble which you see in old churches in our country
825,2518-154826-0045.flac,and here and there still stood a forloren gooseberry bush
826,2518-154826-0021.flac,that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of khorne coming up between the stones then i felt accounting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at 30
827,2518-154826-0047.flac,or if it were not for this holy purpose the band drive would have power to strangle the man that heed it it was by the side of 1 of these old shafts that elsa laid me down at last the light was very low
828,2518-154826-0012.flac,behind 1 of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttress here and there with a bramble bush elvir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry the no farther for this present
829,2518-154826-0014.flac,and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now it is different
830,2518-154826-0052.flac,he shoved them aside with this broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand
831,2518-154826-0043.flac,which was just putting on the brighter green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under a lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment had covered for the most part
832,2518-154826-0016.flac,i wish i had a thimble full of powder to make this whistle sound and he took my skus silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly
833,2518-154826-0039.flac,elsa was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point
834,2518-154826-0050.flac,and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as 1 goes down a hatchway
835,2518-154826-0022.flac,but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached 10 in so heroic enumeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
836,2518-154826-0033.flac,these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a loan hillside come come thou does not want a peace to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
837,2518-154826-0006.flac,and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us here about but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
838,2518-154826-0025.flac,we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the drywall and so elvir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off
839,2518-154826-0008.flac,and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell if that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish
840,2518-154826-0046.flac,on which the marble blocks were once held up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of the shafts
841,2518-154826-0000.flac,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with the silver gray film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
842,2518-154826-0027.flac,have you got a charge of powder to spare so delavier showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe you've seen a flask and walking through the furrows he whispered to me a lie still
843,2518-154826-0005.flac,there came before my eyes that gray face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elvir set up stretching himself like 1 waking out of a sleep
844,2518-154826-0031.flac,the smugglers cut off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed if 20 pound so if i sell you a filing piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprising his voice was changed to suspicion
845,2518-154826-0028.flac,no time was wasted in words elvir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elvir what have you dropped your shot flask 2 asked the boy
846,2518-154826-0036.flac,that i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the human cry but before elsa was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hillbrow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is passed already
847,2518-154826-0054.flac,and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and let it match
848,2518-154826-0051.flac,and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that deer village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elsa paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
849,2518-154826-0017.flac,with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west
850,2518-154826-0023.flac,and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elsa but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
851,2518-154826-0030.flac,but that must be a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or a buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if that art beat be beat for something more said elvir the tempter
852,2518-154826-0007.flac,this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbeck which they call joseph's pit and there we must go but it will take all the day to get there
853,2518-154826-0010.flac,it was afternoon for the sun was passed the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sword of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
854,2518-154826-0024.flac,enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall
855,2518-154826-0053.flac,and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down
856,2518-154826-0011.flac,the ground was braschi with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bidden place enough looking as if it would never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
857,2518-154826-0049.flac,there he said this is joseph's pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posi and human cry
858,2518-154826-0002.flac,and the wind which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seam now but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew a pace
859,2518-154826-0032.flac,for a while he spoke i saw that his i had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied around my leg it is for that very reason says elsa vera that i want the fire lock
860,2518-154826-0004.flac,there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all
861,2518-154826-0019.flac,and gets at length into the shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elsa i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to allow me to slumber
862,2518-154826-0013.flac,though there is not now much farther to go we have passed purbeck gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance come or pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon
863,4830-25904-0023.flac,he wouldn't touch his dinner but laid down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger till his mate could share it with him
864,4830-25904-0048.flac,its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined 1 of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command
865,4830-25904-0005.flac,so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelicans i never knew before what handsome birds they were not graceful but with such snowy plumage tinged with pale pink and faint yellow
866,4830-25904-0003.flac,and i was so glad to meet with anyone from home that i'd have padded him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me he didn't however
867,4830-25904-0045.flac,on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes chasing 1 another
868,4830-25904-0010.flac,i like this line very much for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro
869,4830-25904-0006.flac,they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with the great bills
870,4830-25904-0008.flac,and there found a splendid sight 6 lions and lionesses in 3 or 4 different cages sitting or standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes
871,4830-25904-0025.flac,as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here it was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows
872,4830-25904-0027.flac,he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at everyone like an ill-tempered old bachelor half a dozen little ones teased him capitally by dropping bits of bread
873,4830-25904-0016.flac,gave 1 a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic
874,4830-25904-0047.flac,and came at the keeper's call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had 4 fins instead of 2
875,4830-25904-0020.flac,the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more
876,4830-25904-0028.flac,nutshells and straw down on him from above as they climbed about the purchase or swung by their tails 1 poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail i'm afraid the gray 1 bit it off
877,4830-25904-0029.flac,and kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldn't hold him and down he'd go
878,4830-25904-0040.flac,and then nodded his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fiery ide head in the middle he was not 1 of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits
879,4830-25904-0049.flac,the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water were sitting on a block of ice panting as if the mild spring day was blazing midsummer
880,4830-25904-0030.flac,bounce onto the straw at first he'd sit and stare about him as if much amazed to find himself there then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys
881,4830-25904-0007.flac,when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it until the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy the lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen
882,4830-25904-0044.flac,hoping to find something eatable i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees flocks of snow white cranes stalking over the grass
883,4830-25904-0035.flac,best when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wondered i hope he hasn't got
884,4830-25904-0031.flac,and finally he had examined his poor little tail and appeared to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much
885,4830-25904-0017.flac,for they tumbled 1 over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders
886,4830-25904-0015.flac,this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as a rose while the man went slowly down the line
887,4830-25904-0026.flac,who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers a mama sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the grey monkey with the blue nose scolded at me
888,4830-25904-0012.flac,it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and everyone laughed at the sound there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species
889,4830-25904-0000.flac,being alone in london yet wishing to celebrate the day i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoo logical gardens a lovely place it was and i enjoyed myself immensely for mayday in england is just what it should be
890,4830-25904-0033.flac,since i had a team green 1 who lived under the doorstep and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out and i wasn't allowed to poke them
891,4830-25904-0041.flac,which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive i was walking toward the camel's pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face it's the boa i thought
892,4830-25904-0037.flac,as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boas glittering eyes
893,4830-25904-0018.flac,1 lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw and he clutched it trying to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming
894,4830-25904-0011.flac,some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear 1 of them purr when the keeper scratched her head
895,4830-25904-0043.flac,i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent i i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket
896,4830-25904-0019.flac,as if the whole family of wild beasts were after her
897,4830-25904-0038.flac,and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainous-looking reptile he was and i fell grateful that i didn't live in a country
898,4830-25904-0002.flac,for the birds and beasts are so skillfully arranged that it is more like traveling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a manager the first thing i saw was a great american bison
899,4830-25904-0021.flac,1 little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner which was an example to the rest the lion's ate and dignified silence
900,4830-25904-0042.flac,much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge
901,4830-25904-0032.flac,and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away the snake house came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family i rather like snakes
902,4830-25904-0001.flac,mild sunny flowery and spring-like as i walked along the well-kept paths between white and rosy hawthorne hedges i kept coming upon new and curious sights
903,4830-25904-0014.flac,and all to get very much excited about something snipping at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till
904,4830-25904-0046.flac,and in an immense wire covered avery all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as gayee as if at home 1 of the curiosities was a seal who lived in a tank of saltwater
905,4830-25904-0036.flac,out i said to myself thinking of a story i read once of a person in a manager who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding toward him
906,4830-25904-0004.flac,and put down his immense head with a sullen snort as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost
907,4830-25904-0034.flac,and blinked at me through the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakes black brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain ones but i like the great boa
908,4830-25904-0050.flac,he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw
909,4830-25904-0022.flac,all but my favorite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned away with a plaintiff moan which seemed to grieve him sadly
910,4830-25904-0013.flac,i sat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl
911,4830-25904-0009.flac,1 lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering
912,4830-25904-0024.flac,as i took a last look at his final face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad douglas douglas tender and true
913,4830-25904-0039.flac,with such unpleasant neighbors might pop in upon you on expectedly he was kind enough to take a prominade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself
914,4830-25898-0037.flac,don't flap and stagger so let me hold you taste this mint leaf have a drop of water what shall i do as poor mrs clark sighed and sobbed her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back
915,4830-25898-0050.flac,but it was a long way and dust came on before the red farmhouse appeared now i'm safe thank you very much won't you come in and stay all night my mother will be glad to see you
916,4830-25898-0011.flac,what a nice time speckled did have to be sure for the grasshoppers were lively and fat and aunt was in an unusually amiable mood never run away from anything but faced danger and conquer it
917,4830-25898-0001.flac,and no sooner were the out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as gayee as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their special benefit it was a fine brewed
918,4830-25898-0024.flac,for some time after this mrs clark kept a 3 remaining little ones close to her side watching over them with maternal care till they were hardly tired of her anxious cluckin peep and peck were always together
919,4830-25898-0007.flac,which ended in shanties utter defeat for he died from his wounds downey and snowballs soon followed for the 2 sweets would swing on the barrow leaves that grew over the brook
920,4830-25898-0054.flac,to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her but the vow of a leafless tree too stiff and weak to fly up she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the doorstep
921,4830-25898-0022.flac,came of it and all the chicks laughed that made strut mad and he resolved to crow even if he killed himself doing it he gave an angry cluck flapped his wings and tried again alas alas
922,4830-25898-0016.flac,for every foul in the yard twitted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice
923,4830-25898-0008.flac,sitting side by side the plump sisters were placidly swing up and down over the clear brown water rippling below when uh said to relate the stem broke and down went leaf
924,4830-25898-0012.flac,like a brave chick said the old bitty as she went cluckin through the grass with her gray turbine wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark
925,4830-25898-0035.flac,their pecs stopped suddenly rolled up her eyes and began to stagger about as if she was tipsy mercy on us what's the matter with the chick cried mrs cluck in great alarm fits ma'am answered dr drake
926,4830-25898-0029.flac,and having taken the taste of everything she was about to leave when she heard the stableman coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the mil bin and hid herself
927,4830-25898-0036.flac,who just then waddled by oh what can i do scream the distressed hen nothing ma'am it's fatal and the doctor waddled on to visit dame partlet son who was ill of the pip my child my child
928,4830-25898-0000.flac,there never was a prouder mama than madame clerk when she led forth her family of 8 down a little chicks chant to clare strut snowball speck peep peck downey and blot with their names
929,4830-25898-0032.flac,she strayed into the sheep shed and finding some salt ate as much as she liked not knowing that salt is bad for hens having taken all she wanted she ran back to the barn
930,4830-25898-0002.flac,but poor madam clerk had bad luck with her chicks for they were her first and she didn't know how to manage them old aunt cockle top told her that she didn't and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends
931,4830-25898-0048.flac,blood saw a little kitten mewing pitifully as it sat under the fence what is the matter dear asked kind blocked
932,4830-25898-0053.flac,in colder and colder became poor bls little feet as she waited through the drifts the fire light was shining out into the gloom
933,4830-25898-0045.flac,and cockle top pecked and croaked fiercely but tough as she was the old bitty did not escape and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand
934,4830-25898-0031.flac,with her poor little claws sticking straight up as if imploring help peek meanwhile got into mischief also
935,4830-25898-0039.flac,and the bereaved parent wore a black string around her leg for a month blot the last of that bright band needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow this was the reason why her mother never
936,4830-25898-0018.flac,until his throat quite achd with the effort ah if i could only fly through the highest beam in the barn and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear i should be perfectly happy said the silly little foul
937,4830-25898-0020.flac,you'll fall and get hurt said his sister blot hold your tongue you ugly little thing and don't talk to me i'm going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen be quiet down there
938,4830-25898-0023.flac,for poor strut he leans so far forward in his frantic effort to get a big crawl out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor killing himself instantly
939,4830-25898-0040.flac,had loved her as much as she did the others who were all white gray or yellow poor little blot had been much neglected by everyone but now her lonely mama discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was
940,4830-25898-0055.flac,and with a shiver put her little head under her wing trying to forget hunger weariness and the bitter cold and wait patiently for mourning but when morning came little blot lay frozen stiff under a coverlet of snow
941,4830-25898-0021.flac,and here if i can't do it as well as daddy the chick stopped scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear struck crow perching himself on the beam he tried his best
942,4830-25898-0052.flac,so goodbye dear and off trotted blot along the snowy road hoping to get home before the hen house the door was shut faster and faster fell the snow darker and darker grew the night
943,4830-25898-0014.flac,an unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away chirping dismally
944,4830-25898-0003.flac,and cockle top was right as you will see when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family the tragedy began with chanty who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow
945,4830-25898-0044.flac,and peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pulled her off screaming doly
946,4830-25898-0027.flac,and can't look after you just now said their mother 1 day yes ma'am chirp the chickens and then as she went rustling into the ho they began to run about and enjoy themselves with all their might
947,4830-25898-0025.flac,being very fond of 1 another peep was a most inquisitive chicken poking her head into every nook and corner and never satisfied till she had seen all there was to see peck was a glutton
948,4830-25898-0013.flac,the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give 1 loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her little speckle remembering the advice
949,4830-25898-0034.flac,where is peep asked mrs clark
950,4830-25898-0030.flac,sam never saw her but shut down the cover of the bin as he passed and left poor peep to die no 1 knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal
951,4830-25898-0043.flac,and we're seen by their surviving relatives featherless pale and stiff borne away to some unknown place when snow foul return blot was wait 1 night by a great cackling and fluttering in the hen house
952,4830-25898-0042.flac,they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farmyard for turkeys hens ducks and geese fell a prey to it
953,4830-25898-0038.flac,gasping and rolling up her eyes in great anguish for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt and there was no help for her when all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush covered the little grave with chickweed
954,4830-25898-0009.flac,chickens and all to a watery death i'm the most unlucky hand ever hatched groaned
955,4830-25898-0006.flac,chanty thought he could beat mr bantam easily he was so small and invited him to fight mr b declined then chanty called him a coward and gave mrs b a peck
956,4830-25898-0051.flac,said the kit rubbing her soft white face against blatz little black breast
957,4830-25898-0019.flac,so he tried every day to fly and crow and that last managed to get up then how he did strut in russell his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him
958,4830-25898-0015.flac,what shall i do it was a dreadful blow to mrs clark and anne cockle top didn't show herself for a whole day after that story was known
959,4830-25898-0017.flac,he was at it from morning till night and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill small voice make funny attempts to produce horse little crows as he sat on the wall and stretched his yellow neck
960,4830-25898-0046.flac,in the morning few remained and blot felt that she was a forlorn orphan a thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours brooding over her sad lot
961,4830-25898-0004.flac,before he had a feather to his bit of a tail chanty began to fight and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farmyard having pecked his brothers and sisters he tried to do the same to his playmates
962,4830-25898-0049.flac,i live at the red farmhouse over the hill only i don't know which road to take i'll show you come at once for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for us said blot so away they went
963,4830-25898-0010.flac,and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with aunt cockle top grass hoping they called it in the great field across the road
964,4830-25898-0026.flac,eating everything she could find and often making herself ill by gobbling too fast and forgetting to eat a little gravel to help digest her food don't go out of the barn children i'm going to lay an egg
965,4830-25898-0041.flac,for blot was a great comfort to her never running away or disobeying in any way but always close to her side ready to creep under her wing or bring her a plump bug when the poor bitties appetite failed her
966,4830-25898-0028.flac,peep found a little hole into the mill room and slipped in full of joy at the sight of the bags boxes and bins i'll eat all i want and then i'll call pec she said
967,4830-25898-0005.flac,the ducklings goslings and young turkeys and was so disagreeable that all the fowls hated him 1 day a pair of bantams arrived pretty little white birds with red crests and nice yellow feet
968,4830-25898-0047.flac,and longing to join her family in some safe and happy land where fowls lived in peace she had her wish very soon for 1 day when the first snowflakes began to flutter
969,4830-25898-0033.flac,and it was innocently catching gnats when her mama came out of the hole with a loud cut cut cut
970,2893-139322-0048.flac,you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them suppose this is only a rumor
971,2893-139322-0049.flac,it sounds true cisano let us have the facts said graham
972,2893-139322-0039.flac,they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of 1 of the general intelligence offices
973,2893-139322-0031.flac,the policemen who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things
974,2893-139322-0021.flac,for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this oncoming to work but at night
975,2893-139322-0016.flac,they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath 1 of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits
976,2893-139322-0023.flac,many of these workers had lips and nostrils a lid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chance to be much in fashion asano apologized to graham for this offensive sight but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route
977,2893-139322-0015.flac,had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honor and a high morality now it was differentiating into an indistinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own even with a dialect of its own
978,2893-139322-0007.flac,the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation
979,2893-139322-0004.flac,struck graham most vividly 1 lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut
980,2893-139322-0001.flac,on their way the platform crossed the temps twice and passed in the broad viaduct across 1 of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid
981,2893-139322-0022.flac,in spite of every precaution the labor policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby
982,2893-139322-0027.flac,by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking missed and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulate about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of whitewashed wall
983,2893-139322-0033.flac,the roar and rattle of belt and armature of alit subterranean isles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pinpoint lights here was the smell of tanning and here the weak of a brewery
984,2893-139322-0050.flac,even now the ruins may be impossible graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest 1 and their asano accosted a laborer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech what did he say asked graham
985,2893-139322-0047.flac,he said i might have known the hour has come he thought swiftly what am i to do go back to the council house citizen why should i not appeal the people are here
986,2893-139322-0051.flac,had not someone in the wind vein offices learned he said a girl a girl not he said a girl he did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins
987,2893-139322-0029.flac,their feet made a halo thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at the scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing stop that shouted 1 of the policemen but the order was disobeyed
988,2893-139322-0011.flac,the latter day laborer male as well as female was essentially a machine minder and feeder a servant in attendant or an artist under direction the women in comparison with those grammar remembered
989,2893-139322-0002.flac,the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water over arched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receiving lights a string of black barges passed sea word manned by blue clad men
990,2893-139322-0018.flac,he came to the warren of the jewellers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree
991,2893-139322-0038.flac,but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left and fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms
992,2893-139322-0000.flac,chapter 21 the underside from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufacturers was done
993,2893-139322-0025.flac,graham made some indignant comments but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudites they were near the barbaric by 200 years
994,2893-139322-0009.flac,the voluntary vigor of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter-day workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gayee dressed managers and 4 women
995,2893-139322-0010.flac,who are directing their labors the burley laborers of the old victorian times had followed that dre horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dextrous machine
996,2893-139322-0052.flac,and then another thing was shouted something that turned in aimless tumult into determinant movements it came like a wind along the street
997,2893-139322-0017.flac,the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they and their shrouded isles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways
998,2893-139322-0044.flac,he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking oh struck the nave for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream
999,2893-139322-0032.flac,that walk left on graham's mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swath halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery
1000,2893-139322-0045.flac,he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tears of platforms and the shouting running people who were justic
1001,2893-139322-0012.flac,whereas a class distinctly plain and flat chested 200 years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion 200 years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigor from the blue canvas myriads
1002,2893-139322-0006.flac,the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces is the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuit making place of the potter's among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers
1003,2893-139322-0040.flac,then a woman with a face a mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran what has happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting
1004,2893-139322-0035.flac,even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation once and again and again a third time
1005,2893-139322-0043.flac,and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay and green and gold came leaping down the platforms towards him balling again and again in good english this is ostros doing ostrog the nave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse
1006,2893-139322-0005.flac,and blotted out the picture presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretense of architectural ornament disappeared
1007,2893-139322-0014.flac,to the euthanasie and peace to be steadfast against such inducements will scarcely be expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities of graham's former life the newly aggregated laboring mass
1008,2893-139322-0024.flac,this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement she might have done better with herself than that said asano
1009,2893-139322-0041.flac,that men yelled to 1 another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police
1010,2893-139322-0037.flac,when he saw a number of blue clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labor police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder
1011,2893-139322-0042.flac,he hesitated looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew asked dano graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work
1012,2893-139322-0003.flac,the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noi and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labor department was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks
1013,2893-139322-0034.flac,and here unprecedented reeks everywhere were pillars and cross arch of such a massive as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brick work crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world
1014,2893-139322-0036.flac,graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learned that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again
1015,2893-139322-0019.flac,each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow
1016,2893-139322-0008.flac,but wherever there was work it was being done by slow-moving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlook of the workplaces and the orange clad labor police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls
1017,2893-139322-0030.flac,and first 1 and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp
1018,2893-139322-0020.flac,had the oddest effect the work was beautifully executed
1019,2893-139322-0046.flac,the masters betrayed they cried the masters betrayed suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent
1020,2893-139322-0026.flac,and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous arches and any he had seen 3 barg smothered in flowery dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar
1021,2893-139322-0028.flac,every now and then 1 would stop to cough a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky
1022,2893-139322-0013.flac,to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendors and delights and at last
1023,2893-139310-0001.flac,a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half-opened door and to the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theater
1024,2893-139310-0045.flac,a tall shallow dark-haired shining ide youth white clad from top to toe clamored up towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down again and receded looking backward heads shoulders
1025,2893-139310-0005.flac,he grasped the arm of the shouting person tell me he cried who am i who am i the others came nearer to hear his words
1026,2893-139310-0016.flac,he's at the wind vein offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannized at last even in my name my name master
1027,2893-139310-0052.flac,attendance intervened in ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left before him when the backs of the guards in black 3 and 3 and 3 he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway
1028,2893-139310-0023.flac,on the 1 hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
1029,2893-139310-0002.flac,behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
1030,2893-139310-0027.flac,a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing 1 man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth
1031,2893-139310-0051.flac,the flow of people smoke downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet he was aware of a path before him of a suite about him of guards and dignities and lincoln on his right hand
1032,2893-139310-0035.flac,he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant she became to him flushed an eager as she was and embodiment of the song
1033,2893-139310-0025.flac,but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him
1034,2893-139310-0018.flac,no 1 expected you to wake they were cunning damn tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotize you kill you again the hall dominated everything ostrog is at the wind vein offices ready
1035,2893-139310-0014.flac,our leader in your name in my name
1036,2893-139310-0029.flac,but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of
1037,2893-139310-0019.flac,even now there's a rumor of fighting beginning the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him a strug has it planned trust him we have our organizations ready we shall seize the flying stages
1038,2893-139310-0015.flac,why is he not here he has deputed us i am his brother his half-brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent
1039,2893-139310-0021.flac,masked in the inaudible it is now or never the council is rocking they cannot trust even their drilled men here the people calling to you graham's mind was like a knight of moon and swift clouds
1040,2893-139310-0053.flac,with the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up at him he did not know whether he went he did not want to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall
1041,2893-139310-0038.flac,the whole multitude was swaying and congested masses individual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him momentarily and lost definition again close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by 3 men
1042,2893-139310-0047.flac,most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly white and disease was there and many a hand that waved to him was gone and lean men and women of the new age strange and incredible meeting as the broadstream passed before him to the right
1043,2893-139310-0000.flac,the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man and a yellow garment he took the dose forth with and in a moment he was glowing
1044,2893-139310-0008.flac,it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me
1045,2893-139310-0034.flac,wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtly folded mantle hung from his shoulders
1046,2893-139310-0033.flac,the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred him emboldened him the hall opened to him
1047,2893-139310-0044.flac,a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right he perceived a blue clad negro a shriveled woman in yellow then a group of tall fair-haired white-faced blue clad men pushed theatrically past him he noted to china men
1048,2893-139310-0028.flac,he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed
1049,2893-139310-0042.flac,march his mouth shaped in audible heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward they were no longer marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp tramp in that host
1050,2893-139310-0024.flac,monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamoring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him
1051,2893-139310-0032.flac,full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating time tramp tramp he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically
1052,2893-139310-0046.flac,hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood their eyes met his and passed and vanished men gesticulate things
1053,2893-139310-0012.flac,the people in the little room could not hear each other's shout graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him
1054,2893-139310-0031.flac,the voices were gathered together in upporn by a torrent of instrumental music music like the music of an organ
1055,2893-139310-0003.flac,a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch
1056,2893-139310-0039.flac,her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff next to this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind shouted a hairless face a great cavity of toothless mouth a voice called
1057,2893-139310-0037.flac,the hall was a vast and intricate space galleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheater steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity
1058,2893-139310-0010.flac,because you are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name the sounds from the hall had died into a silence
1059,2893-139310-0004.flac,and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly
1060,2893-139310-0006.flac,his eyes searched their faces they've told him nothing cried the girl tell me tell me cried graham you are the master of the earth you are owner of the world
1061,2893-139310-0043.flac,where bearded men old men used fluttering robed bare armed women girls men and women of the new age rich robes gray rags fluttered together in the world of their movement amidst the dominant blue
1062,2893-139310-0011.flac,threaded by 1 manat voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult a roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices horse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted
1063,2893-139310-0017.flac,the young man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder
1064,2893-139310-0049.flac,mingled in the ranks tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was tramping the garments waived onward the faces poured by more abundantly tramp tramp tramp tramp
1065,2893-139310-0036.flac,he emerged in the all cove again incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting guided by lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the center of the stage facing the people
1066,2893-139310-0020.flac,even now he may be doing that then this public theater balled the man in yellow it's only a contingent we have 5 myriads of drilled men we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a leader
1067,2893-139310-0013.flac,but who is ostrog he said
1068,2893-139310-0040.flac,ostrog all his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song the multitude were beating time with their feet marking time tra tra tra tra the great weapons waived
1069,2893-139310-0048.flac,tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people tramp tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was enriched in complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages men and women
1070,2893-139310-0022.flac,now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man soden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism
1071,2893-139310-0007.flac,he did not believe he heard a right he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i've been awake 3 days a prisoner 3 days
1072,2893-139310-0041.flac,flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him passing towards a great archway shouting to the council tramp tramp tramp tramp tramp he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled
1073,2893-139310-0009.flac,counselors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference
1074,2893-139310-0030.flac,lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others saved the woman justic towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song
1075,2893-139310-0050.flac,at lincoln's pressure he turned toward the archway walking unconsciously in that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir it the multitude the gesture and song all moved in that direction
1076,2893-139310-0026.flac,and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were balling for order silence
1077,78-369-0054.flac,when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly 2 days journey
1078,78-369-0061.flac,oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the demon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do
1079,78-369-0055.flac,my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before
1080,78-369-0035.flac,will satisfy my everlasting hatred my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words
1081,78-369-0015.flac,i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards a spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil alluded my grasp
1082,78-369-0038.flac,the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down
1083,78-369-0037.flac,oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness
1084,78-369-0062.flac,swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no
1085,78-369-0059.flac,i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the site i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to constructors and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship
1086,78-369-0053.flac,warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the demon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until
1087,78-369-0029.flac,these words were legible in 1 of these inscriptions you live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north
1088,78-369-0049.flac,i should guess that i had passed 3 weeks in this journey and the continual pro protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often rung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes
1089,78-369-0034.flac,1 inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toil is only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings
1090,78-369-0022.flac,i always presented to those who would provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy oh blessed sleep
1091,78-369-0025.flac,heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice and beheld clervil enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come
1092,78-369-0063.flac,sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tail at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish
1093,78-369-0041.flac,and i hope to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in 2 days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants
1094,78-369-0023.flac,often when most miserable i sank to repose in my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfill my pilgrimage
1095,78-369-0016.flac,suddenly the broad disc of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my tasks
1096,78-369-0052.flac,what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within
1097,78-369-0018.flac,the snow's descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown
1098,78-369-0030.flac,where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am in passive you will find near this place if you follow not too tiredly a dead hair
1099,78-369-0056.flac,as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes it tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy
1100,78-369-0044.flac,he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured
1101,78-369-0026.flac,and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonizing fondness did i feel for them
1102,78-369-0043.flac,through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs
1103,78-369-0019.flac,would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sunk under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert
1104,78-369-0027.flac,and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the demon more as a task and joined by heaven
1105,78-369-0036.flac,and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervor to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon
1106,78-369-0017.flac,scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some marked to guide me
1107,78-369-0046.flac,my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge
1108,78-369-0039.flac,and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirits for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversaries jib to meet and gravel with him
1109,78-369-0051.flac,gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and 1 sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plane
1110,78-369-0048.flac,threatened by destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
1111,78-369-0028.flac,as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious then as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know
1112,78-369-0032.flac,the peasants were shut up in their hubbels and only a few of the most hearty ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice
1113,78-369-0050.flac,despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil
1114,78-369-0058.flac,several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor
1115,78-369-0045.flac,mmm it's cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant
1116,78-369-0031.flac,again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy
1117,78-369-0047.flac,i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment
1118,78-369-0040.flac,some weeks before this period i had procured a sled and dogs and thus traverse the snows with inconceivable speed
1119,78-369-0057.flac,and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death
1120,78-369-0024.flac,during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father
1121,78-369-0060.flac,but your direction was northward you took me on board when my vigor was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiple ide hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled
1122,78-369-0021.flac,advantage i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the demon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected
1123,78-369-0033.flac,and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off for my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labors
1124,78-369-0042.flac,concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage
1125,78-369-0002.flac,i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are deceased but with life
1126,78-369-0003.flac,all the hardships which travelers in deserts and barbarous countries i want to meet how i have lived i hardly know
1127,78-369-0008.flac,their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth
1128,78-369-0007.flac,and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seem to fit around
1129,78-369-0005.flac,uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it
1130,78-369-0011.flac,keep the agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adger with solemnity and in awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends
1131,78-369-0014.flac,and then i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a well-known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear
1132,78-369-0012.flac,heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance
1133,78-369-0004.flac,and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dare not die and leave my adversary in being when i quitted geneva my first labor
1134,78-369-0001.flac,my first resolution was to quit geneva forever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful
1135,78-369-0006.flac,and approach the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn
1136,78-369-0013.flac,it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains re-echoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter
1137,78-369-0000.flac,chapter 24 my present situation was 1 in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury
1138,78-369-0009.flac,on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the demon
1139,78-369-0010.flac,which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work
1140,78-368-0052.flac,i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt thought of that hottie fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed
1141,78-368-0002.flac,the cloud swept across its swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves
1142,78-368-0047.flac,and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he
1143,78-368-0051.flac,my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just a man i have but 1 resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction
1144,78-368-0039.flac,and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now relate my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy
1145,78-368-0007.flac,great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope
1146,78-368-0036.flac,and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer
1147,78-368-0001.flac,the wind which had fallen in the south now rows with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend
1148,78-368-0035.flac,revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose
1149,78-368-0021.flac,subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine
1150,78-368-0005.flac,when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fiber was suspended
1151,78-368-0017.flac,after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceed the short distance from the house
1152,78-368-0029.flac,and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father and earnest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore
1153,78-368-0040.flac,and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested
1154,78-368-0015.flac,but he eluded me leapt from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room
1155,78-368-0012.flac,but the deadly langer and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished their murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck
1156,78-368-0006.flac,i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs the state lasted but for an instant
1157,78-368-0018.flac,a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered around the room
1158,78-368-0000.flac,chapter 23 it was 8:00 when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn
1159,78-368-0013.flac,and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described
1160,78-368-0041.flac,when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power
1161,78-368-0025.flac,however it was hardly mourning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night
1162,78-368-0044.flac,who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude
1163,78-368-0008.flac,she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form
1164,78-368-0010.flac,but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them
1165,78-368-0024.flac,there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavorable and the rain fell in torrance
1166,78-368-0004.flac,and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was distinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence
1167,78-368-0034.flac,and desired and ardently prayed that it might have him within my grasp to wreak a great
1168,78-368-0053.flac,how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease
1169,78-368-0016.flac,nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless
1170,78-368-0009.flac,flung by the murderer on its bridal breer could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated
1171,78-368-0048.flac,i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you have
1172,78-368-0026.flac,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful in a event is single in the history of man
1173,78-368-0028.flac,know that 1 by 1 my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted
1174,78-368-0031.flac,sometimes indeed i dreamt that i
1175,78-368-0030.flac,misery on his gray hairs doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way
1176,78-368-0019.flac,as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i rose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it
1177,78-368-0043.flac,i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance
1178,78-368-0050.flac,but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice
1179,78-368-0037.flac,however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood
1180,78-368-0033.flac,the monster whom i had created the miserable demon i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him
1181,78-368-0045.flac,since the commission of his crimes and no 1 can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit
1182,78-368-0011.flac,to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her
1183,78-368-0020.flac,and join my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind
1184,78-368-0042.flac,from the execution of those functions on this occasion
1185,78-368-0032.flac,melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released for my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood the solitary cell had been my habitation
1186,78-368-0027.flac,but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate
1187,78-368-0049.flac,have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be
1188,78-368-0022.flac,the murder of claraval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend
1189,78-368-0046.flac,and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the shamwa and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative
1190,78-368-0038.flac,my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive
1191,78-368-0023.flac,my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and earnest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action
1192,78-368-0014.flac,i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abort a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife
1193,78-368-0003.flac,that we're beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects
1194,4853-29413-0027.flac,a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we haven't heard of yet mr roy lake i had been dressing for some time past longing to see crystal it is needless to say
1195,4853-29413-0031.flac,had we any proof to justify us gluty at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i i searched the boat house no oars no oars
1196,4853-29413-0024.flac,how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by 2 doses given with a space of time between them
1197,4853-29413-0026.flac,i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he thought the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was on us honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor
1198,4853-29413-0019.flac,it was born in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police
1199,4853-29413-0012.flac,the investigation that followed was far too long and too weary some to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming
1200,4853-29413-0009.flac,what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too crystal had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause
1201,4853-29413-0015.flac,but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned
1202,4853-29413-0018.flac,that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain
1203,4853-29413-0022.flac,she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what is situation for a girl of 18
1204,4853-29413-0030.flac,i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the os
1205,4853-29413-0011.flac,the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll answer them to the best of my ability
1206,4853-29413-0028.flac,is there anything more i asked that i ought to know only 1 thing mr roy lake that i can think of gluty replied i'm afraid it's miss crystals turn next what do you mean
1207,4853-29413-0013.flac,the kerr had betrayed himself it was a poultry vengeance ion to gratify a malicious pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested
1208,4853-29413-0032.flac,and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me nothing sir
1209,4853-29413-0017.flac,a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever bloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time
1210,4853-29413-0016.flac,gluty was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party
1211,4853-29413-0021.flac,that she was true as steel and not easily frightened i didn't need to guess i knew it gluty had done his best to prepare crystal for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded
1212,4853-29413-0020.flac,the 1 way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss crystal that she was fond of you i don't mean any offense sir i pretty well guessed
1213,4853-29413-0014.flac,to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the kurr regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed
1214,4853-29413-0025.flac,i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said
1215,4853-29413-0010.flac,we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law enforce i said in the meantime gluty i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little
1216,4853-29413-0029.flac,while the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on miss crystal early this morning sir i happen to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars
1217,4853-29413-0023.flac,whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea yes well that was 1 of the signals agreed on between us
1218,4853-29413-0005.flac,i'm dismissed from my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked
1219,4853-29413-0003.flac,the delay of dressing was more than i had patients to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me gluty showed himself at the door
1220,4853-29413-0000.flac,gluty settles the account a knight of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened
1221,4853-29413-0006.flac,what did he do flew into a furious rage i don't complain of that i dare say i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window
1222,4853-29413-0002.flac,the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom
1223,4853-29413-0007.flac,even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mr roy lake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you only i don't know how
1224,4853-29413-0008.flac,in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us to is settled now on both sides
1225,4853-29413-0004.flac,with the face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of crystal if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir
1226,4853-29413-0001.flac,the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell
1227,4853-27670-0025.flac,until coming a breast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosie there was a wound over his right brow
1228,4853-27670-0028.flac,for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other gear against which leaned a portion of the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away
1229,4853-27670-0029.flac,i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a semen named abraham wise near the forehead
1230,4853-27670-0022.flac,nevertheless it's raised suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped 3 or 4 feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beasts teeth
1231,4853-27670-0005.flac,the brig pitched enrolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in
1232,4853-27670-0011.flac,but no feature of my lamentable situation so a frightened me so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for 1 companion
1233,4853-27670-0003.flac,it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest color upon the hatchway 1 thing i quickly noticed that the gail had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze
1234,4853-27670-0001.flac,i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone
1235,4853-27670-0021.flac,i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log
1236,4853-27670-0035.flac,i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing
1237,4853-27670-0033.flac,nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless
1238,4853-27670-0016.flac,by preventing the seas which washed onto the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side
1239,4853-27670-0009.flac,my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold and utter darkness
1240,4853-27670-0006.flac,it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out
1241,4853-27670-0031.flac,but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been set running by the long fierce scale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the census
1242,4853-27670-0002.flac,my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armor so in flexibly hard where they froze them yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins
1243,4853-27670-0036.flac,and even had i managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned
1244,4853-27670-0034.flac,to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easily have kept her free
1245,4853-27670-0026.flac,and as if that had not suffered to slay him the fall of the mass had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly
1246,4853-27670-0017.flac,my eyes directly sought it and found the time 20 minutes after 10 this signified that i had 10 or 11 hours of darkness before me
1247,4853-27670-0024.flac,i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull
1248,4853-27670-0023.flac,but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea
1249,4853-27670-0010.flac,it was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round
1250,4853-27670-0032.flac,i could hear a 100 harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hall with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside weighty enough you would have supposed to save the ship
1251,4853-27670-0008.flac,what has come to pass is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard certainly 5 men at least were living before we followed the ice and again i cried out is there anyone alive
1252,4853-27670-0012.flac,even 1 only to make me an echo for mine own speech nay got himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not the blackness lay like a poll upon the deep and upon my soul
1253,4853-27670-0007.flac,finding that i had the use of my voice i hallowed as loudly as i could but no human note responded 3 or 4 times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought
1254,4853-27670-0004.flac,there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley
1255,4853-27670-0014.flac,reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in our manner of mounting the seas and that after all
1256,4853-27670-0000.flac,i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvelous
1257,4853-27670-0019.flac,i swallowed half a pannikin of the hollands for the sake of the warmth and life of the draft and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them
1258,4853-27670-0015.flac,her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand
1259,4853-27670-0018.flac,i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew
1260,4853-27670-0027.flac,that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinyin and choke a man under a massive rigging in the larboard scuppers lay 2 bodies as i could just faintly discern
1261,4853-27670-0020.flac,and i then with the siemens dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days
1262,4853-27670-0013.flac,misery and horror were within that shadow and beyond it nothing that my spirit could look up to i stood for some moments as 1 stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea
1263,4853-27670-0030.flac,no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea
1264,4853-27671-0027.flac,the boat was about 15 feet long
1265,4853-27671-0013.flac,it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her and if this well fell over her bows and filled the decks down she would go i had a small parcel of guinea in my chest and was about to fetch this money
1266,4853-27671-0019.flac,i threw the ore over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her
1267,4853-27671-0037.flac,was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of 1 of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its hottie surprise
1268,4853-27671-0031.flac,then by sailing into the great desolation of the northwest the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering
1269,4853-27671-0021.flac,and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her ball works fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under
1270,4853-27671-0035.flac,lifting my eyes within voluntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies
1271,4853-27671-0036.flac,it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions and poised on tremors wings
1272,4853-27671-0004.flac,when extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the longboat it was thus we carried those boats the little 1 lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks
1273,4853-27671-0025.flac,and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason i rose from the seat onto which i had sunk and loose the sale
1274,4853-27671-0007.flac,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a hand spike prized her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
1275,4853-27671-0026.flac,and hauling the sheet aft put the ore over the stern and brought the little crafts head to an easterly course the draft of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impuls enough to the sale to raise a bubble alongside
1276,4853-27671-0038.flac,the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me its eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies
1277,4853-27671-0024.flac,so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustained by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great
1278,4853-27671-0012.flac,the heavy sluggish soden movement of the hole advised me to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue browse to her stem
1279,4853-27671-0015.flac,heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulder of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendor along
1280,4853-27671-0039.flac,it was a silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature
1281,4853-27671-0014.flac,when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her a drift the sun was an hour above the horizon
1282,4853-27671-0011.flac,8 or 10 biscuits some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flour and 13 bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat
1283,4853-27671-0001.flac,i had it 1 time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some 2 or 3 hours after sunrise
1284,4853-27671-0022.flac,and which she dragged down with her on a sudden when the last fragment of masked had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea up rose a body with a sort of leap
1285,4853-27671-0033.flac,and then all was bare bald swelling sea and then purled sky darkening in lagoons of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapor lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon
1286,4853-27671-0010.flac,i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to become at either upon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham
1287,4853-27671-0040.flac,it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope flopped its wings and after a turn or 2
1288,4853-27671-0029.flac,where per chance i might meet a whaler or a south sea man from new holland but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard indeed
1289,4853-27671-0009.flac,but i met with an ore that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her
1290,4853-27671-0018.flac,with us had it done yesterday instead of today my companions would have been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing a stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last
1291,4853-27671-0002.flac,and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the ball work rail
1292,4853-27671-0030.flac,i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up and that though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship here about
1293,4853-27671-0017.flac,shot with pearly luster floated overhead very high it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the are being dry it's shrewdness was endurable
1294,4853-27671-0023.flac,it was the sailor that had laying down on the starboard side of the forward deck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended
1295,4853-27671-0020.flac,into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hole floated she was something to hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon
1296,4853-27671-0003.flac,yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the forum asked was gone smooth off the deck it lay over the starboard bow
1297,4853-27671-0032.flac,i am persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly is the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck
1298,4853-27671-0034.flac,but 1 living thing there was besides myself a gray breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hole went down and then
1299,4853-27671-0006.flac,and there lay the longboat crushed into staves the signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates
1300,4853-27671-0028.flac,are i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer northwestern blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea
1301,4853-27671-0000.flac,there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable paul overhead into bless the hull a very deep
1302,4853-27671-0005.flac,had floated the jolly boat out of the longboat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the briggs struck the burg the masts fell
1303,4853-27671-0008.flac,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hat full of water
1304,4853-27671-0016.flac,till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover
1305,4018-107338-0012.flac,he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords and a quarter of an hour and that have not inconvenient to me
1306,4018-107338-0026.flac,there can be other than 1 and the same object a thousand said morally we have already as many parties as in st stevens itself you terrify me said cibil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
1307,4018-107338-0031.flac,very useful no doubt i hope it will find them but of no validity if money with the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter
1308,4018-107338-0009.flac,then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morally at first he recollected nothing
1309,4018-107338-0001.flac,perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me and my youth and 1 is not apt to forget such things
1310,4018-107338-0010.flac,he doubtless had them now is he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
1311,4018-107338-0017.flac,had he not accompanied me to the store and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
1312,4018-107338-0020.flac,and yet if anything were to happen tomorrow said morally rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though 1 of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
1313,4018-107338-0002.flac,and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
1314,4018-107338-0003.flac,and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld her with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young years
1315,4018-107338-0029.flac,saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest out myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of justice that moberi castle is as much yours
1316,4018-107338-0032.flac,i'll not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely fit for business
1317,4018-107338-0008.flac,is yours at life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maximum of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
1318,4018-107338-0027.flac,my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believe that we had on our side god and the truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley
1319,4018-107338-0018.flac,you are right said morally looking at a rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves to unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said civil
1320,4018-107338-0016.flac,the mystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sibil there was no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here today he met and addressed me and i only recognized and acquaintances
1321,4018-107338-0011.flac,this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
1322,4018-107338-0028.flac,the factions and the failures of our oppressors at this moment gerard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rows together an advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of civil and morally
1323,4018-107338-0007.flac,is the privilege of the people of whom i am 1 said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labor their labor said cibil
1324,4018-107338-0025.flac,lawfully meeting an open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavour to degrade them
1325,4018-107338-0015.flac,hers were kind and calm and this agramonte said morally rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
1326,4018-107338-0024.flac,moley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is an active life 1 cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
1327,4018-107338-0004.flac,and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and escort and thoughts hatton in his appearance realized little of the fancies
1328,4018-107338-0000.flac,moley paused as he recognized agramonte then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mr hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
1329,4018-107338-0022.flac,you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morally and all may continue well
1330,4018-107338-0023.flac,but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirit civil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it is not much suit me i am a man of the closet
1331,4018-107338-0013.flac,he would propose that i should at once accompanied him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here
1332,4018-107338-0019.flac,he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
1333,4018-107338-0006.flac,detract from the favorable effect that he always had once produced
1334,4018-107338-0030.flac,as the house that is built by the tenant of the lord's land but can we prove it we never had the legal evidence you are an error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda
1335,4018-107338-0005.flac,that appearance was prepossessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
1336,4018-107338-0014.flac,you did well good steven as you always do said cibil with the musing and abstracted are no 1 has so much forethought and so much energy is you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
1337,4018-107338-0021.flac,the factions become united civil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen tomorrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
1338,4018-103416-0026.flac,not yet but of course i shall be when you really get going i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made i'm the most ignorant person you ever knew i'd be awfully glad to
1339,4018-103416-0003.flac,for the red cross and kindred activities but although the war was in the nation's mind it was not yet in its soul life went on much as before and abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency
1340,4018-103416-0018.flac,her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marian hayden at 25 knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had

1343,4018-103416-0017.flac,encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder
1344,4018-103416-0033.flac,she was holding out both hands to impede you wouldn't go would you i might have to go he evaded you wouldn't graeme you're all i have all i have left to live for you wouldn't need to go it's ridiculous you needed here

1353,4018-103416-0007.flac,he was rather bored now with the prospect he would have preferred going to the club to play billiards which was his custom of the late afternoon he drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed marian's invitation to get there before the crowd
1354,4018-103416-0011.flac,permeated was a faint scent of late afternoon highballs tommy marion called when she had settled herself yes from a distance did you leave your cigarette on the piano
1355,4018-103416-0024.flac,but more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd like natalie spencer's stupid party the night before so she watched graham and listened he was a nice boy and a handsome 1
1356,4018-103416-0021.flac,we're now sending flowers to the debtors and cutting in on the younger men at balls her house was still a rendevous but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room the library and the music room that afternoon
1357,4018-103416-0005.flac,but again washington knew that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful that the amount of lost territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the british islands was acute

1361,4018-103416-0036.flac,but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received graeme listened
1362,4018-103416-0030.flac,she ignored his protests as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters i'm accustomed to it was her sole reply but her resigned voice brought her as it always had
1363,4018-103416-0015.flac,about the new war contracts oh business
1364,4018-103416-0032.flac,when at a sound in clayton's room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket have you noticed a change in your father since he came back her tone was so ominous that he started he's not sick is he
1365,4018-103416-0037.flac,she was a really pathetic figure crouched in her low chair and shaken with terror she must have a rather bad time there were so many things she dared not take to his father she bought them to him instead her small grievances

1384,4018-107312-0025.flac,said a good human voice it came from 1 of 2 factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped they were gay dressed a light handkerchief tied under the chin their hair scrupulously arranged they wore carl necklaces and earrings of gold
1385,4018-107312-0010.flac,still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase and so it is widow said a little pale man wistfully come come it's getting late and your wife's ill you're a good soul
1386,4018-107312-0016.flac,will indeed you look very like a soul as feeds on wheel continued mrs carrie in an undertone as her declining customer moved away well it gets late said the widow
1387,4018-107312-0003.flac,in the infancy of moberi by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labors
1388,4018-107312-0036.flac,i was speaking of at the harriet last night
1389,4018-107312-0012.flac,oh the carnal monsters exclaimed the widow if there they don't come the bloody-minded naves and for small cops too small cops be hanged am i the man to send up a bad bottom cop widow carry
1390,4018-107312-0013.flac,you sent up for snicks i have known you man and boy john hilly's 20 summers and never heard a word against you till you got into shuffle and screws mil oh they are a bad yarn john
1391,4018-107312-0017.flac,and if you'd like to take this scrag and home to your wife neighbor hill we can talk of the rest next saturday and what you will sir said the widow with a stern expression to a youth who now stopped at her stall
1392,4018-107312-0027.flac,so it has said the girl but then it was so dull i can't stand a country life mrs carrie i must have company well i do love a bit of gossip myself said mrs carrie with great frankness
1393,4018-107312-0002.flac,while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses not as beautiful as the palaces of venice but in their way not less remarkable magnificent shops and here and there though rarely some ancient factory built among the fields
1394,4018-107312-0037.flac,i proposed to go with her but 2 girls alone you understand me 1 does not like to be seen in these places as if 1 kept no company very true said mick and now will be off good night widow
1395,4018-107312-0006.flac,that rose in all directions clustering yet isolated announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of moberi crossing this open ground they gained a suburb but 1 of a very different description
1396,4018-107312-0032.flac,and we shall be happy to see you mick and julia if you were not engaged continue the girl and she looked at her friend a pretty de mure girl who immediately said but in a somewhat faltering tone oh that we shall
1397,4018-107312-0007.flac,to that in which we situate the convent where they had parted with cibil this 1 was populist noisy and lighted it was saturday night the streets were thronged and infinite population kept swarming to and fro
1398,4018-107312-0004.flac,would be the future i saw of a flourishing posterity pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile gerard and steven turned down a street which intersected it
1399,4018-107312-0030.flac,we have got 50 members and taken 3 london papers 1 more than star and 2 moral worlds and where are you now child continued the widow to the girl
1400,4018-107312-0034.flac,but in this season of the year i must have life the moment i came out i bathed in the river and then went home and dressed he added in a satisfied tone and now i am going to the temple i'll tell you what julia has been pricked today with the shuttle
1401,4018-107312-0024.flac,it's very well known that i'm a man what pays his way said the boy and don't keep a huge stall to sell carry and buy starlight but live in a 2 pair if you please and has a wife and family or is good
1402,4018-107312-0014.flac,they do us all widow they pretend to give the same wages as the rest and works it out and finds you can't come and you can't go but there's a fine you've never paid wages but there's a bait ticket
1403,4018-107312-0023.flac,i never said mrs carrie know i never heard a thing like that what not when you cut up the jackass and sold it reveal cutlets mother hold your tongue mr emperor said the widow it's very well known you know christian and who will believe what you say
1404,4018-107312-0020.flac,don't bother me said the jolly widow with the kindling i go to your own mother who is dying in a back cellar without a window while you've got lodgings in a 2 pair dying she's only drunk said the youth
1405,4018-107312-0033.flac,well we had no thoughts but i said to harriet as it is a fine night let us walk about as long as we can and then tomorrow we will lie in bed till afternoon
1406,4018-107312-0021.flac,what makes your drink a toil working from 5:00 in the morning to 7:00 at night and for the like of such as you that's a good 1 said the youth i should like to know what my mother ever did for me but give me trial and laden when i was a baby
1407,4018-107312-0005.flac,and so on through a variety of ways and winding lanes till they arrived at an open portion of the town a district where streets and squares and even roads disappeared and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack looking buildings
1408,4018-107312-0035.flac,i'll stand treat and take you and your friend to the temple well that's delight said caroline there's no 1 does the handsome thing like you dandy mech and i always say so oh i love the temple to sew gentile
1409,4018-107312-0029.flac,but young persons yes said mick i don't think i could get through the day if it weren't for our institute and what's that asked mrs carrie with a sneer the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure said mick
1410,4018-107312-0000.flac,the chief street of moberi called castle street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its neighborhood with a significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependents
1411,4018-107312-0008.flac,by narrow archways like the entrance of hives so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission while ascending to these same streets from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps
1412,4018-107312-0018.flac,he was about 16 with a live figure and a handsome faded impudent face his long loose white trousers gave him height he had no waist cut but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck
1413,4018-107312-0015.flac,i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory finds solar alive but those shuffle and screw are rotten snicky bad yarn said mistress carrie
1414,4018-107312-0031.flac,if you will take a dish of tea with us tomorrow we expect some friends i take it kindly said mrs gary and so you keep house together all the children keep house in these days times has changed indeed
1415,7067-76047-0026.flac,it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honored amused
1416,7067-76047-0006.flac,on the 2nd occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling
1417,7067-76047-0039.flac,i see a lot more than that you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible negligible that is the exact word to them you can't look at a woman for 5 minutes
1418,7067-76047-0030.flac,probably bored her more than she realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers suites jewelry
1419,7067-76047-0011.flac,am i said dr martin know and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party
1420,7067-76047-0024.flac,a manner with ms seafood an excellent manner for me seafood by the by isn't the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day or for 1 person only she is a very sure and commanding young woman sir richmond nodded
1421,7067-76047-0031.flac,and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was 20 i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presence those who seek find
1422,7067-76047-0018.flac,this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves as if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more
1423,7067-76047-0010.flac,i'm twice her age we are a party of 4 there are conventions there are considerations i want you really my dear martino overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests
1424,7067-76047-0021.flac,mifit is a fairly crude mixture of frankness insincerity and self-explanatory egotism and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me
1425,7067-76047-0049.flac,they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martino
1426,7067-76047-0009.flac,she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable self-control and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say
1427,7067-76047-0014.flac,i shall be sorry all the same i could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened a little later the matter was settled nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said
1428,7067-76047-0022.flac,now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little your guess is doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond you know that she has told me as much
1429,7067-76047-0032.flac,what do you think she found what would a rich girl find out there in america i don't know i haven't the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction
1430,7067-76047-0008.flac,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeed in almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady a very good social position indeed
1431,7067-76047-0036.flac,all she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didn't expect it she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth she has ceased to take the world for granted it hasn't broken her but it has matured her
1432,7067-76047-0029.flac,she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexpecting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss gimont is not silly
1433,7067-76047-0020.flac,and in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favored with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile
1434,7067-76047-0005.flac,sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seafood has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was
1435,7067-76047-0016.flac,and honor than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility
1436,7067-76047-0037.flac,that i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you and her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on
1437,7067-76047-0015.flac,but neither gentlemen wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the the inconveniences your present code would set about it
1438,7067-76047-0045.flac,really he said this is preposterous you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf and our ages in our quality
1439,7067-76047-0040.flac,seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity miss gimont has an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoiled child with no discipline
1440,7067-76047-0028.flac,i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescension seem a matter of very great importance to them
1441,7067-76047-0038.flac,she sees history as you see it and i see it she is a very grown-up young woman it's just that said sir richmond it's just that if you see as much and miss grammont as all that why don't you want to come on with us you see the interest of her
1442,7067-76047-0012.flac,there were some moments of silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said dr martin know with a corresponding loss of asperity
1443,7067-76047-0043.flac,grotesque happen he said she knows nothing of martin leeds you must remember that and then he added if she and you fall in love
1444,7067-76047-0048.flac,and at present the world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the core of this situation a pause fell between the 2 gentlemen
1445,7067-76047-0046.flac,from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing our men and women to go on forever separated by this possibility into 2 hard communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds
1446,7067-76047-0041.flac,you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends you on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leads
1447,7067-76047-0025.flac,i suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has wanted a companion or governor butchered the thing has been done these business americans i am told neglect their womankind give them money and power let them loose on the world
1448,7067-76047-0027.flac,talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time i think this must be near the truth of her biography said sir richmond
1449,7067-76047-0044.flac,as the phrase goes what is to follow there was a pause sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offense
1450,7067-76047-0035.flac,and something more than that what it is i don't know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed
1451,7067-76047-0023.flac,well she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready-made solutions that is how i inferred that there was no mother i don't think there has been any stepmother
1452,7067-76047-0013.flac,hi grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kenam latter at bournemouth nothing simpler than to go to him now
1453,7067-76047-0017.flac,but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old 1 and you if you will forgive me are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications
1454,7067-76047-0042.flac,you i say are also at loose ends can you deny it my dear sir don't we both know that ever since we left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you 3 herr porth of kindness
1455,7067-76047-0007.flac,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair
1456,7067-76047-0033.flac,she would find that life was worthwhile to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her sex she would pick up from 1 of them the idea that made life worthwhile for him
1457,7067-76047-0019.flac,may involve very serious consequences indeed with which i for 1 do not wish to be involved sir richmond upon the hearth rug had a curious feeling that he was back in the headmaster's study at caxton
1458,7067-76047-0047.flac,is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you too anyhow
1459,7067-76047-0034.flac,harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance there have been love experiences experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there
1460,7067-76047-0002.flac,and but his lower lip and considered we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite
1461,7067-76047-0001.flac,abroad and original thinker as you are thought is 1 matter rash inconsiderate action quite another and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of
1462,7067-76047-0004.flac,for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum i object to miss grammont and that side of the thing more than i do to missy first
1463,7067-76047-0003.flac,she could for example be left behind with a luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammar there was no immediate reply
1464,7067-76047-0000.flac,after 24 event hours our 2 students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension
1465,7067-76048-0045.flac,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completist control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all
1466,7067-76048-0044.flac,at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mr grammont sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost
1467,7067-76048-0020.flac,i've been talking of this sort of thing with my friend dr martino and i've been thinking as well as talking that perhaps is why i'm so clear in positive i don't complain that you are clear and positive i've been coming along the same way
1468,7067-76048-0040.flac,she had no illusions about the power of the former class it didn't exist they were steered to their decisions by people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates the owners of america the real responsible citizens
1469,7067-76048-0000.flac,i leave you to it his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation hot you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond i shall be interested to learn what happens but if you won't stay to see
1470,7067-76048-0051.flac,and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way
1471,7067-76048-0039.flac,that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well
1472,7067-76048-0034.flac,sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martino he recalled to the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin
1473,7067-76048-0043.flac,father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son
1474,7067-76048-0008.flac,to a happy use by clamoring to the top of it and sliding on their little beehinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing
1475,7067-76048-0002.flac,section 2 for the better part of 40 hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grant or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence
1476,7067-76048-0055.flac,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to dr martino and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that dr martin had not said many of the things sir richmond described to him
1477,7067-76048-0011.flac,nobody is doing anything with the world except model about why not give it a direction you take it in your hands like clay obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its own
1478,7067-76048-0003.flac,and she repeated no remembered comments and profits of her contemporaries about herself she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality
1479,7067-76048-0017.flac,we have been made an exception of and got our rations the big thing confronts us still
1480,7067-76048-0033.flac,she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life that isn't going on she said with an effect of conclusive decision
1481,7067-76048-0025.flac,making them matter as formula they didn't seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before
1482,7067-76048-0001.flac,now sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and dr martin o guardian sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit what else could i do he asked allowed to nobody in particular
1483,7067-76048-0016.flac,who have imaginations want something more nowadays of course we want bright lives of course we want happiness just as we want food just as we want sleep but when we have eaten when we have slept when we have jolly things about us it is nothing
1484,7067-76048-0023.flac,the adolescence so to speak of mankind it is an idea that seizes the imagination there is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears
1485,7067-76048-0035.flac,he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments
1486,7067-76048-0036.flac,in the composition of so sure and gallant of personality martin know was very fine in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he saw a man and woman in every encounter
1487,7067-76048-0041.flac,or they fell a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries but anyhow they were steered she herself it was clear was bound to become very responsible citizen indeed
1488,7067-76048-0005.flac,she liked his turn of thought she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favored visitor
1489,7067-76048-0015.flac,sensible little piggy wiggies we have a right to life and happiness first said sir richmond as much right as a pig has to food but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings
1490,7067-76048-0024.flac,there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities we are sharing the adolescence of our race it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us
1491,7067-76048-0048.flac,she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with 2 men servants
1492,7067-76048-0027.flac,but controlling father as distinguished from managing him she reviewed some private and amusing memories he is a most intractable man section 3
1493,7067-76048-0031.flac,we don't get enough to do we're spenders and wasters not always from choice while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker
1494,7067-76048-0021.flac,it's refreshing to meet you i found it refreshing to meet martin know a twinge of conscience about dr martino turned to richmond into a new channel he's a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects
1495,7067-76048-0029.flac,gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives
1496,7067-76048-0058.flac,what are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically ordered
1497,7067-76048-0042.flac,she would someday she laughed be swimming in oil and such like property her interest and sir richmond schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was therefore she realized a very direct 1 but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that

1739,5393-19218-0045.flac,and fearing also the rebuke of the police the 2 masks turned their eyes elsewhere at the end of another minute the carriage load of masters had their hands full the multitude set to yelling which is the crowd's caress to masquerades
1740,5393-19218-0021.flac,anyone in these vehicles as it once a spectator and a spectacle police sergeants maintained on the sides of the boulevard these 2 interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current
1741,5393-19218-0052.flac,can you see the bride if you stoop down no and the bridegroom there's no bridegroom in that trap ba unless it's the old fellow tried to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low i can't
1742,5393-19218-0038.flac,that by piling nominee upon a program that people should be enticed that the system of spying and serving is carried to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them

1744,5393-19218-0023.flac,and pleasant with coats of arms held the middle of the way going and coming freely certain joyous and magnificent trains notably
1745,5393-19218-0061.flac,who that old cove belongs to and where that wedding pair lives i like that that would be queer it's so easy to find out a wedding party that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday a week afterwards a pin and a hoe
1746,5393-19218-0034.flac,or they overwhelm a hired landau with its top thrown back with their tumultuous groups 20 of them ride in a carriage intended for 6 they cling to the seats to the rumble on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts
1747,5393-19218-0059.flac,not particularly more than i am at any rate well what of that you must try to find out where that wedding party went to where it went yes i know where is it going then to the
1748,5393-19218-0035.flac,enriched with slang this carriage which has become colossal through its freight has an air of conquest uproar reigns in front tamal behind people vifer shout howl
1749,5393-19218-0054.flac,i don't care a hang for old fellows that i don't i know him know him if you want to how the devil does he come to be 1 of the wedding party we're in it too where does that wedding come from
1750,1334-135589-0100.flac,to alice and grenville to edith and as his majesty himself said as he gave away the brides could loyalty be better rewarded but our young readers will not be content if they do not hear
1751,1334-135589-0010.flac,said the prince in securing the services of such fine young men you will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service and then follow me to jen to which province i am now about to depart
1752,1334-135589-0003.flac,and he will soon be opposed to this truculent and dishonest court who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes but who have never intended to keep their promises and place me on the english throne
1753,1334-135589-0102.flac,and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself he then married clara ratcliffe who was not appeared lately on the scene owing to her having been about 2 years before the restoration
1754,1334-135589-0083.flac,as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you
1755,1334-135589-0012.flac,and had been reinforced by troops from spain set up the standard of revolt edward and his friends joined them with about 300 english and scotchman which they had enlisted and very soon afterwards
1756,1334-135589-0014.flac,and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of st antoine in which neither party had the advantage
1757,1334-135589-0084.flac,but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away
1758,1334-135589-0055.flac,and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty
1759,1334-135589-0091.flac,after that speech sir the sooner you get back again the better retarded edith but edward made a sign to humphrey and they beat a retreat have you seen the intent in humphrey no
1760,1334-135589-0079.flac,mr heatherstone may make his own terms i must waive all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i've seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife
1761,1334-135589-0058.flac,you were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey who has all long been acting as his fact totem in the business and recollect at the time that mr heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion
1762,1334-135589-0031.flac,it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles i'm sure it is them yes replied granville
1763,1334-135589-0080.flac,let her father but give me her and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess ironwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are
1764,1334-135589-0004.flac,i will give you letters to k and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong that is not your affair
1765,1334-135589-0006.flac,you are here highly spoken of said the prince for so young a man so you were at the affair of worcester we will retain you for your services will be wanted by and by
1766,1334-135589-0044.flac,and i understand is a very princely mention humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mr heatherstone does it not replied edward
1767,1334-135589-0021.flac,made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
1768,1334-135589-0007.flac,can you procure any of your countrymen i know but of 2 that i can recommend from personal knowledge but these 2 officers i can venture to pledge myself for anymore
1769,1334-135589-0020.flac,and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands tran bore down conda who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
1770,1334-135589-0013.flac,kind of obtained the victory at benan and in april 1652 advanced to paris tran who had taken the command of the french army followed him
1771,1334-135589-0025.flac,on the 15th of may 1660 the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the 8th and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king's sailed from shoveling
1772,1334-135589-0062.flac,those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
1773,1334-135589-0033.flac,for a while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the 2 girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
1774,1334-135589-0042.flac,i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
1775,1334-135589-0049.flac,although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in 1 lot
1776,1334-135589-0087.flac,and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
1777,1334-135589-0040.flac,now edward who do you think was here today the reigning bell and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
1778,1334-135589-0095.flac,tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and eateth wrong as regards his daughter
1779,1334-135589-0028.flac,and his attendant suit shaolin are edward and grenville who rode side by side as gentlemen and waiting we're certainly the most distinguished among the king's retinue look at edward
1780,1334-135589-0008.flac,bring me the officers tomorrow at this hour miss your beverly or revo
1781,1334-135589-0036.flac,allison edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
1782,1334-135589-0065.flac,and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we met as well hear inform the reader
1783,1334-135589-0097.flac,on mr heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
1784,1334-135589-0054.flac,recollect also that mr heatherstone and his brother-in-law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
1785,1334-135589-0032.flac,will they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
1786,1334-135589-0064.flac,even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the monies impressed that upon them my dear edward
1787,1334-135589-0009.flac,edward went to shain and granville who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them the next day they were at the prince's levy and introduced by edward i am fortunate gentlemen
1788,1334-135589-0017.flac,he wrote a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might 1 day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
1789,1334-135589-0041.flac,no less than 1 with whom you were formerly well acquainted edward patients heatherstone patients heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
1790,1334-135589-0022.flac,edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
1791,1334-135589-0071.flac,edward half concealed himself behind 1 of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve
1792,1334-135589-0093.flac,that will be exclamation sufficient i shall meet him as 1 whom i shall always revere
1793,1334-135589-0059.flac,what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or if you're ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mr heather stone's intentions than he has made known to us
1794,1334-135589-0105.flac,oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age
1795,1334-135589-0037.flac,the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverly said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
1796,1334-135589-0000.flac,chapter 27 but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army
1797,1334-135589-0060.flac,and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mr heatherstone intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward
1798,1334-135589-0099.flac,then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fet at hampton court given in honor of 3 marriages taking place edward beverly to patients heatherstone shaolin are
1799,1334-135589-0039.flac,which it gave to edward to find his sister's grown such accomplished and elegant young women that is 2 friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
1800,1334-135589-0005.flac,k is just now released from vincennes but depend upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levy of the prince of conda
1801,1334-135589-0001.flac,you have to choose between 2 generals both great and the art of war
1802,1334-135589-0096.flac,nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed past my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mr heatherstone edward
1803,1334-135589-0053.flac,which has been so long held by others
1804,1334-135589-0056.flac,at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mr heatherstone wait and see what he profess first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
1805,1334-135589-0057.flac,ysc rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
1806,1334-135589-0061.flac,and now let me give you some advice for your friends master shaolin and granville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
1807,1334-135589-0024.flac,and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and everything was ready for the restoration
1808,1334-135589-0045.flac,how can you say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it anymore my dear edith i am in great perplexity
1809,1334-135589-0023.flac,after the peace and the pardon of conduct by the french king the armies were disbanded and the 3 adventure they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
1810,1334-135589-0075.flac,and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
1811,1334-135589-0089.flac,to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argue upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
1812,1334-135589-0070.flac,mr heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
1813,1334-135589-0069.flac,and waiting for the arrival of his sisters shaolin granville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
1814,1334-135589-0090.flac,replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all of your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
1815,1334-135589-0047.flac,and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
1816,1334-135589-0051.flac,is receiving a favor where it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property
1817,1334-135589-0048.flac,but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not faced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
1818,1334-135589-0015.flac,and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his departure from paris edward had received humphrey's letter explaining a way the intendance conduct
1819,1334-135589-0088.flac,you know humphrey how many offers patients heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
1820,1334-135589-0043.flac,with her today when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
1821,1334-135589-0026.flac,was met at dover by general monck and conducted to london which he entered amid the acclamations of the people on the 29th of the same month we may leave the reader to support that edward
1822,1334-135589-0092.flac,i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially
1823,1334-135589-0018.flac,except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects it may be years before i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
1824,1334-135589-0027.flac,were among the most favored of those in his train as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude the windows of all the houses were filled with well-dressed ladies who waved their white kurch shifts to the king
1825,1334-135589-0063.flac,but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
1826,1334-135589-0011.flac,and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required a month after this interview conda who had been joined by a great number of nobles
1827,1334-135589-0094.flac,what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him you're coming with me will make it appear so
1828,1334-135589-0076.flac,i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patients made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
1829,1334-135589-0104.flac,the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a house full of young gypsies
1830,1334-135589-0034.flac,well shaolin are to all appearance your good ants have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
1831,1334-135589-0085.flac,it is now 7 years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mr heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
1832,1334-135589-0077.flac,and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her sober splendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was unable to go to his sisters
1833,1334-135589-0038.flac,and they could escape from their personal attention edward and his 2 friends went to the house in which resided the ladies cunningham and his sisters we passed over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
1834,1334-135589-0086.flac,and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of 17 to 24 will cherish the image of 1 who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
1835,1334-135589-0068.flac,on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
1836,1334-135589-0002.flac,and tran i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon that will be the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players which would your majesty recommend me to follow inquired edward
1837,1334-135589-0050.flac,you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you in 2 s alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you cannot blame accepting the property for mr heatherstone
1838,1334-135589-0098.flac,patients colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her
1839,1334-135589-0066.flac,that the advice was immediately acted upon and that shaolin are and grenville recovered all their estates at about 5 years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had dispatched the messenger with the letter
1840,1334-135589-0074.flac,and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mr heatherstone advanced and made his obese
1841,1334-135589-0072.flac,but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
1842,1334-135589-0029.flac,at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize them indeed i do not are they any of our paris beauties
1843,1334-135589-0052.flac,he cannot refuse it putting out your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his council will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
1844,1334-135589-0081.flac,they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mr heatherstone
1845,1334-135589-0016.flac,and the contents removed to heavy load from edward's mine but he now thought of nothing but war and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
1846,1334-135589-0106.flac,in the capacity of housekeeper her temporary becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties
1847,1334-135589-0103.flac,claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey
1848,1334-135589-0035.flac,although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
1849,5678-43303-0036.flac,i am back all is well now listen can you hear yes yes the best has happened it is all over in the east felsenberg has done it now listen i cannot come home tonight it will be announced in paul's house in 2 hours from now
1850,5678-43303-0019.flac,she was not offended for she trusted her husband too well but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating the old lady too seemed excited she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks and hardly smiled at all to the girl's greeting
1851,5678-43303-0025.flac,as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would close that afternoon 20:00 came but there was no sign of oliver the paris valer should have arrived an hour before
1852,5678-43303-0018.flac,he seemed moved at something and mabel looked at him in astonishment it is not eastern news she asked his eyebrows wrinkled a little
1853,5678-43303-0008.flac,he made a little deprecating movement with his hands it is not certain that she will die
1854,5678-43303-0027.flac,of course she might have missed it there was no depending on its exact course but she had seen it a hundred times before and wondered unreasonably why she had not seen it now but she would not sit down to dinner and paced up and down in her white dress
1855,5678-43303-0026.flac,but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels 1 by 1
1856,5678-43303-0003.flac,she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body the old lady was so tranquil and human
1857,5678-43303-0017.flac,he will will he not you have not heard mr brant said he would be here for a late dinner he will reach london at 19 and is there any other news he compressed his lips there are rumors he said mr brand wired to me an hour ago
1858,5678-43303-0012.flac,so the girl went downstairs once more with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still what a strange and beautiful thing death was she told herself this resolution of a cord that had hung suspended for 30 50 or 70 years
1859,5678-43303-0038.flac,yes quick mother is ill shall i leave her how l oh no immediate danger the doctor has seen her there was silence for a moment yes come then we will go back tonight anyhow then
1860,5678-43303-0023.flac,and he had given her no news of the paris convention he only repeated that mr oliver would be back that night then he had gone off in a hurry half an hour later the old lady seemed to sleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her
1861,5678-43303-0024.flac,neither did she like to leave the house so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing to the long shadow lay across the path and the tumbled platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west
1862,5678-43303-0002.flac,and mabel running upstairs and alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair it is nothing my dear said the old lady tremulously and she added the description of a symptom or 2
1863,5678-43303-0009.flac,she asked no no she may live 10 years i said he added a word or 2 of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and went away the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand
1864,5678-43303-0000.flac,mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch and for a few days did her best but there was nothing that alarmed her the old lady was a little quiet perhaps but went about her minute affairs as usual she asked the girl to read to her sometimes
1865,5678-43303-0029.flac,and the heavenly darkness why did not oliver come or at least let her know why he did not once she went upstairs miserably anxious herself to reassure the old lady and found her again very drowsy he has not come she said
1866,5678-43303-0033.flac,she hath decided to touch them 1 by 1 and inquire whether anything had been heard of her husband there was his club his office in waitall mr phillips house parliament house and the rest but she hesitated telling herself to be patient
1867,5678-43303-0030.flac,i dare say he may be kept in paris the old face on the pillow nodded and murmured and mabel went down again it was now an hour after dinner time oh there were a hundred things that might have kept him
1868,5678-43303-0006.flac,her whole point so to speak lay in the delicate little fabric of personality built out of fragile things into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts the death of a flower reflected mabel his sadder than the death of a lion
1869,5678-43303-0034.flac,oliver hated interference and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety then even as she turned away the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight whitehall she pressed the corresponding button and her hands shaking so much
1870,5678-43303-0016.flac,where a heap of letters lay to be answered a couple of hours later as mabel went upstairs once more she met mr phillips coming down he looked a little flushed under his sallow skin mrs bran sent for me he said she wished to know whether mr oliver would be back tonight
1871,5678-43303-0031.flac,he had often been later than this he might have missed the valor he meant to catch the convention might have been prolonged he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire
1872,5678-43303-0011.flac,for there was no past to set straight no judge to be confronted death was an ending not a beginning it was a peaceful gospel at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come
1873,5678-43303-0005.flac,she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul for in that case she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things
1874,5678-43303-0021.flac,he will be back to dinner will he not if the valer is not late now mother are you ready for breakfast mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation it was certain that something had happened
1875,5678-43303-0015.flac,mr phillips arrived the next morning as usual just as mabel had left the old ladies room and asked news of her she is a little better i think said mabel she must be very quiet all day the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room
1876,5678-43303-0037.flac,we are communicating with the press come up here to meet me at once you must be present can you hear oh yes come then at once it will be the greatest thing in history tell no 1 come before the rush begins in half an hour the way will be stopped oliver
1877,5678-43303-0004.flac,so absorbed in small external matters so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth so utterly without resentment or peevishness
1878,5678-43303-0020.flac,said mabel old mrs bran looked at her sharply and instant but said nothing don't excite yourself mother oliver will be back tonight the old lady drew a long breath don't trouble about me my dear she said i shall do very well now
1879,5678-43303-0007.flac,the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace it is syncope said the doctor when it came in she made diet any time she may live 10 years there is no need to telegraph for mr brand
1880,5678-43303-0022.flac,the secretary who breakfast with her in the parlor looking onto the garden had appeared strangely excited he had told her that he would be away the rest of the day mr oliver had given him his instructions he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question
1881,5678-43303-0035.flac,that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear she listened who is there her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice tiny and manu across the miles of wire i mabel she said alone here
1882,5678-43303-0032.flac,he might even have wired to mr phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it there it was that round silent month that little row of labeled buttons
1883,5678-43303-0013.flac,back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself those same notes would be struck again were being struck again even now all over the world though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch
1884,5678-43303-0001.flac,she packed his bag with her own hands set out his furs for the swift flight to paris and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction he would be gone 3 days he said it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill
1885,5678-43303-0028.flac,turning again and again to the window listening to the soft rush of the trains the faint hoots from the track and the musical cords from the junction a mile away the lights were up by now and the vast sweep of the town's looked like fairyland between the earthly light
1886,5678-43303-0010.flac,well my dear she asked it is just a little weakness mother you must like quiet and do nothing shall i read to you no might here i i will think a little it was no part of mabel's idea to duty to tell her that she was in danger
1887,5678-43303-0014.flac,but that particular emotion was gone it was foolish to think that it was sounding internally elsewhere for there was no elsewhere she too herself would cease 1 day let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely
1888,5678-43301-0000.flac,in his masonic insignia it was he who had given immense impetus to that secret movement by his declaration in the house that the key of future progress and brotherhood of nations was in the hands of the order
1889,5678-43301-0016.flac,the kingdom of god it was said lay within the human heart and the greatest of all graces was charity she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure 100 yards away
1890,5678-43301-0019.flac,of this great anniversary then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present 50 years ago the speaker said poverty was still a disgrace now it was so no longer
1891,5678-43301-0002.flac,and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ thus he had
1892,5678-43301-0017.flac,and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or 2 across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him then he stepped back and oliver came forward it was too far for the 2 to hear what was said but mabel slipped a paper smiling tremulously
1893,5678-43301-0006.flac,and converge toward the wide railed space about the platform where room was reserved for them the windows on every side were packed with faces tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and st martin's church
1894,5678-43301-0021.flac,he enumerated the reforms passed 50 years before on this very day by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty
1895,5678-43301-0014.flac,and all england was familiar with it old mrs bran lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes and saw the words that she knew so well the lord that dwells in earth and sea
1896,5678-43301-0018.flac,into the old lady's hand and herself bent forward to listen old mrs bran looked at that too knowing that it was an analysis of her son speech and to wear that she would not be able to hear his words
1897,5678-43301-0008.flac,the old column was gone with its lions
1898,5678-43301-0009.flac,nor are the lions to the new art and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery overhead the roofs showed crowded freezes of heads against the blue summer sky
1899,5678-43301-0007.flac,garden beds of color behind the mutant white statues that faced outwards round the square from braith weight in front past the victorians john davidson john burns and the rest round to hampton and de montford toward the north
1900,5678-43301-0001.flac,it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted st paul had been right he declared in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations
1901,5678-43301-0010.flac,"not less than 100,000 persons it was estimated in the evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon as the clocks began to tell the hour 2 figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward and in an instant"
1902,5678-43301-0012.flac,and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion behind him came oliver bareheaded and spruce and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement
1903,5678-43301-0004.flac,and this platform was hung with roses surmounted by a sounding board and set with a chair and table the whole square roundabout was paved with heads and resonant with sound the murmurs of thousands of voices
1904,5678-43301-0026.flac,and a storm of laughter rippled around the throng of heads she heard an indrawn hiss behind her chair and the next instant and exclamation from mabel what was that there was a sharp crack and the tiny gesticulating figure staggered back a step
1905,5678-43301-0013.flac,there was no doubt that these londoners could sing it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody rising to enthusiasm till the music of massed bands followed it as a flag follows a flag stick the hymn was 1 campos 10 years before
1906,5678-43301-0005.flac,overpowered now and again by the crash of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds each headed by a banner
1907,5678-43301-0020.flac,it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay who would not honor a man worn out in the service of his country or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail
1908,5678-43301-0015.flac,had been composed with both skill and artur they had a religious ring the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm yet their sensei was plain enough the old human creed that man was all even christ's words themselves were quoted
1909,5678-43301-0024.flac,a couple of women with an old man directly behind and other faces visible again behind them they're obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction and she turned resolutely once more to the square ah he was working up now to his panegirico
1910,5678-43301-0025.flac,the tiny dark figure was back a yard near the statue and as she looked his hand went up and he wheeled pointing as a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice then again he was forward half crouching for he was a born actor
1911,5678-43301-0003.flac,and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesman appeared to be 1 of the speakers though at a slightly higher elevation
1912,5678-43301-0022.flac,and its reward and that he supposed together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws would form the first half of his speech the second part was to be a panegirico
1913,5678-43301-0027.flac,the old man at the table was up in a moment and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were masked and directly opposite the front of the platform
1914,5678-43301-0011.flac,the murmurs of talk rows into cheering old lord pepperton came first a gray-haired upright man whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over 70 years ago and his son had succeeded him worthily
1915,5678-43301-0023.flac,old mrs bran leaned back in her seat and looked about her the window where they sat had been reserved for them 2 armed chairs filled the space but immediately behind there were others standing very silent now craning forward watching 2 with parted lips
1916,5678-43302-0029.flac,toe balls banares yakuts everywhere and he's been to australia mabel set up briskly isn't that very hopeful i suppose so there's no doubt that the sufis are winning but for how long is another question
1917,5678-43302-0025.flac,oliver stirred presently did you notice anything just now sweetheart when i said that about jesus christ she stopped knitting for a moment said the girl he nodded you saw that too then
1918,5678-43302-0011.flac,speaking in defense of his principles it was an incalculable gain for them and loss for the individualists that confessors were not all on 1 side after all
1919,5678-43302-0018.flac,my dear i feel very downcast sometimes as you know well i do not think i shall be again i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit and that the old tories were partly right when they prophesied what communism would do
1920,5678-43302-0007.flac,but he must have meant to do it anyhow continued oliver how do they know he was a catholic asked the girl again there was a rosary on him and then he just had time to call on his god and nothing more is known
1921,5678-43302-0010.flac,scikit the prime minister maxwell snowed and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations and from every part of england streamed in message after message it was an immense stroke for the communists
1922,5678-43302-0040.flac,it was on 2 largest scale occasionally people went mad people who had succeeded in goating their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness but that was all
1923,5678-43302-0003.flac,but well i dare say it was more merciful but you did what you could my dear said the old lady anxiously from the corner i called out to them mother but they wouldn't hear me
1924,5678-43302-0030.flac,besides the troops don't disperse and europe europe is arming as fast as possible i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris i must go your arm my dear my arm must get well it will have to go with me anyhow
1925,5678-43302-0033.flac,these new benon shine explosives will make certain of that but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them absolutely been and shine sold them simultaneously to east and west then he died luckily for him mabel had heard this kind of talk before
1926,5678-43302-0039.flac,european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual men still build houses married wives begat sons and daughters did their business and went to the theater for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else they could neither save nor precipitate the situation
1927,5678-43302-0024.flac,but she could see what she loved to see that responds to her own heart and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs
1928,5678-43302-0021.flac,if only this infernal eastern affair would end he knew he was feverish and irritable and made a great effort to drive it down oh my dear he went on flushed a little
1929,5678-43302-0015.flac,there was some passion and loyalty left in england his mother got up presently and went out still without a word and mabel turned to him laying a hand on his knee are you too tired to talk my dear he opened his eyes
1930,5678-43302-0012.flac,the huge electric placards over london had winged out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight oliver brand wounded catholic as salient indignation of the country
1931,5678-43302-0035.flac,now if tales were true entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell the new conditions were unimaginable military experts prophecy extravagantly contradicting 1 another on vital points
1932,5678-43302-0019.flac,but after this well well we have shown that we can shed our blood too it is in the nick of time too just at the crisis i don't want to exaggerate it is only a scratch but it was so deliberate and
1933,5678-43302-0014.flac,he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and torn at his throat then the face had vanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared oh
1934,5678-43302-0036.flac,the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory there were no precedents with which to compare it it was as if archer's disputed as to the results of cordite only 1 thing was certain that the east had every modern engine and as regards male population
1935,5678-43302-0022.flac,if they would not be such heavy fools they don't understand they don't understand yes oliver they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is humanity life truth at last and the death of folly but haven't i told them a hundred times
1936,5678-43302-0031.flac,tell me some more there is no more but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis if the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now it will never be likely to raise it again it will mean free trade all over the world i suppose
1937,5678-43302-0038.flac,founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world felson berg's name appeared more frequently than ever otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush nothing suffered very much trade went on
1938,5678-43302-0016.flac,of course not my darling what is it what do you think will be the effect he raised himself a little looking out as usual through the darkening windows onto that astonishing view
1939,5678-43302-0008.flac,nothing more he was well-dressed though oliver leaned back a little wearily and closed his eyes his arms still throbbed in tolerably but he was very happy at heart it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic
1940,5678-43302-0034.flac,but her imagination simply refused to grasp it a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing there had been no european war within living memory and the eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions
1941,5678-43302-0020.flac,and so dramatic the poor devil could not have chosen a worse moment people won't forget it mabel's eyes shone with pleasure you poor dear she said are you in pain not much besides christ
1942,5678-43302-0001.flac,but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors he was a catholic explained the drawn faced oliver he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded
1943,5678-43302-0005.flac,she said then she broke off and sat back why did he shoot just then she asked oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother but she was knitting tranquili then he answered with a curious deliberateness
1944,5678-43302-0037.flac,half as much again as the rest of the world but together and the conclusion to be drawn from these premises was not reassuring to england but imaginations simply refused to speak the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day
1945,5678-43302-0028.flac,she can't get it out of her head even after 50 years well watch her won't you by the way yes there's a little more news from the east they say felzenberg running the whole thing now the empire is sending him everywhere
1946,5678-43302-0027.flac,no my dear you're excited and tired it's just a little sentiment however i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her but she hears it everywhere now no she doesn't remember
1947,5678-43302-0026.flac,maple do you think she is falling back oh she is getting old said the girl lightly of course she looks back a little but you don't think it would be too awful she shook her head no
1948,5678-43302-0004.flac,maybelline forward oliver i know this sounds stupid of me but but i wish they had not killed him oliver smiled at her he knew this tender trait in her it would have been more perfect if they had not
1949,5678-43302-0023.flac,she loved to see him like this his confident flushed face the enthusiasm in his blue eyes and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with passion she bent forward and kissed him suddenly my dear i am so proud of you oh oliver he said nothing
1950,5678-43302-0032.flac,and all that kind of thing but if not well if not there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined
1951,5678-43302-0006.flac,i said that braith weight had done more for the world by 1 speech than jesus and all his saints put together he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second then they went on again as before
1952,5678-43302-0000.flac,oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home leaning back in his chair with 1 arm bandaged and in a sling they had not been able to get near him at the time the excitement in the square had been too fierce
1953,5678-43302-0002.flac,well there was no chance for a priest this time mabel nodded slowly she had read of the man's fate on the placards he was killed trampled and strangled instantly said oliver i did what i could you saw me
1954,5678-43302-0013.flac,well-deserved fate of assassin he was pleased too that he honestly had done his best to save the man even in that moment of sudden and acute pain he had cried out for a fair trial but he had been too late
1955,5678-43302-0009.flac,but he was not sorry to bear pain in such a cause and it was obvious that the sympathy of england was with him mr phillips even now was busy in the next room answering the telegrams that poured in every moment
1956,5678-43302-0017.flac,everywhere now lights were glowing a sea of mellow moon's just above the houses and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening the effect he said it can be nothing but good it was time that something happened
1957,8975-270782-0044.flac,subsequently every opportunity is made use of to disparage the new arrival and even attempts to do him bodily harm direct attacks are not unheard of
1958,8975-270782-0092.flac,others maintain that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the person's under consideration in both cases furthermore the incest avoidance would be automatically assured
1959,8975-270782-0059.flac,because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny their significance in life and to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing much oftener than it really is fulfilled but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth
1960,8975-270782-0003.flac,but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken the antiquity into which the dreamwork carries a spa is of a double aspect firstly the individual antiquity childhood and secondly in so far as every individual in his childhood
1961,8975-270782-0097.flac,since the dream regresses to this stage it seems to have made a parent the evil that lies in us but it is only a deceptive appearance by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams
1962,8975-270782-0028.flac,this wish was no stranger to him while the child was still a suckling this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom
1963,8975-270782-0103.flac,which however disclose only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dreamwork is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression
1964,8975-270782-0089.flac,when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field
1965,8975-270782-0071.flac,and this love is substituted for the outworn love when cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the oedipus complex on the contrary it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults
1966,8975-270782-0037.flac,we have wandered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature and certainly we're not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past
1967,8975-270782-0002.flac,so we call the mode of expression of the dreamwork the archaic or regressive you may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dreamwork we gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our intellectual development i trust this will be true
1968,8975-270782-0022.flac,in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asks the question when such a wish comes
1969,8975-270782-0024.flac,the woman whose dream is interpreted to mean that she would like to see her 17-year-old daughter dead discovers under our guidance that she in fact at 1 time entertained this wish
1970,8975-270782-0041.flac,for his brothers and sisters with that which he has for his parents
1971,8975-270782-0082.flac,under the pressure of education he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes rather a credits to both the same genital formation
1972,8975-270782-0085.flac,and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child
1973,8975-270782-0107.flac,how does 1 solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that chairs its characteristics
1974,8975-270782-0007.flac,that of a gap in the memory is far more frequent i believe we have not laid enough stress on this fact the child is able to speak well at the age of 2 it soon shows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic situations
1975,8975-270782-0087.flac,of perverse sexual activity to be sure the grown-ups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances as play for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of custom or before the law
1976,8975-270782-0073.flac,cast out of life was yielded up to poetry and given the freest play oh rank has shown in a careful study how this very oedipus complex has supplied dramatic literature
1977,8975-270782-0069.flac,but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child and 1 tends rather to underestimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments which may follow from it in addition
1978,8975-270782-0015.flac,and in so far as the cure is to any degree successful we are able again to bring to light the content of the childhood years thus clouded in forgetfulness these impressions have never really been forgotten they have only been inaccessible latent
1979,8975-270782-0050.flac,and rivalry among them but how may feelings of hatred force their way into the relationship between daughter and mother parents and children this relationship is without doubt the more favorable even when looked at from the viewpoint of the child
1980,8975-270782-0052.flac,which in the other case we permitted to remain profane
1981,8975-270782-0062.flac,as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example 3 it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses
1982,8975-270782-0057.flac,to the enjoyment thereof impatient waiting for the death of the father grows to heights approximating tragedy in the case of a successor to the throne less strained is the relationship between father and daughter mother and son
1983,8975-270782-0061.flac,it is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people the dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents especially the parent of the same sex we may conclude that it is also present during waking hours
1984,8975-270782-0040.flac,not until later does the love impulse become independent of egoism in brief egoism has taught the child to love in this connection it is instructive to compare the child's regard
1985,8975-270782-0026.flac,she beat her body with her fists in a fit of anger in order to kill the child how many mothers who today loved their children tenderly perhaps too tenderly received them unwillingly and at the time wished that the life within them would not develop further
1986,8975-270782-0027.flac,indeed translated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some loved 1 which seemed so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person
1987,8975-270782-0064.flac,h6 but we also find this stream wish in places where it has no connection with life and where the adult in his waking hours would never recognize it the reason for this is that the deepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly
1988,8975-270782-0035.flac,which most frequently can be traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer
1989,8975-270782-0042.flac,often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling or rather let us say glossed over but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier it is most notable in children of from 2 and 1/2
1990,8975-270782-0111.flac,which shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we met to be sure propound the question what forces the psychological activity during sleep to such regression
1991,8975-270782-0079.flac,what we call perverse in the life of an adult differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the gulf between man and animal second
1992,8975-270782-0108.flac,the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication
1993,8975-270782-0063.flac,by which it is suppressed and must wait until a dream isolates it that which the dream shows us in enlarged form as a result of such isolation shrinks together again after it has been properly docketed in its relation to life as a result of our interpretation
1994,8975-270782-0055.flac,the abstention from sexual liberty which society demands in certain cases also she is the rival who objects to being displaced the same type of thing occurs in a more glaring manner between father and son
1995,8975-270782-0113.flac,what is the use of giving new life to old long outgrown psychic stimuli wishes and character types that is why the material regression in addition to the formal the only satisfactory answer would be this
1996,8975-270782-0095.flac,with all its peculiarities its egoism its incestuous love choice etc continues for the purposes of the dream in the unconscious
1997,8975-270782-0049.flac,if there is anyone who hates a young english lady more than does her mother it is her elder sister there is something about this saying whoever that arouses our antipathy we can at a pinch understand hatred of brothers and sisters
1998,8975-270782-0093.flac,and most customary choice and that not until later is there any resistance the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology
1999,8975-270782-0096.flac,infantile side of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slight of its dimensions partly because it is likely considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child
2000,8975-270782-0014.flac,by means of careful analysis 1 is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten
2001,8975-270782-0109.flac,between these 2 parts the dreamwork completes itself the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious necessitates regression this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream
2002,8975-270782-0034.flac,that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past let us continue with the removal or death wish
2003,8975-270782-0066.flac,who is a disturbing element in her tender relationship with her father and who occupies a position that she could very well fill herself when learn from these observations to what early years these ideas extend back
2004,8975-270782-0047.flac,we need seldom find it puzzling and may trace its origin easily to early childhood often enough also to the propinquity of later years probably know nurseries are free from mighty conflicts among the inhabitants
2005,8975-270782-0114.flac,that only in this manner can a dream be built up
2006,8975-270782-0038.flac,or real remnants thereof show themselves for the child loves itself first in later learns to love others to sacrifice something of its ego for another
2007,8975-270782-0053.flac,the feelings between parents and their grown children failed to come up to the ideal established by society how much enmity exists and would find expression did not accumulations of piety and of tender impulse hold them back the motives for this are everywhere now
2008,8975-270782-0043.flac,to 4 or 5 years of age when a new little brother or sister arrives the latter is usually received in a far from friendly manner expressions such as i don't want him let the store take him away again are very usual
2009,8975-270782-0017.flac,beautiful examples of this occur in literature and i myself can present such an example i once dreamed in a certain connection of a person who must have performed some service for me and who might clearly saw he was a 1 eyed man short in stature stout
2010,8975-270782-0070.flac,children frequently react to the oedipus idea through stimulation by the parents who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences so that the father prefers the daughter the mother the son
2011,8975-270782-0081.flac,he knows no unbridgeable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he is not disgusted at the sight of excrement but slowly learns to be so disgusted
2012,8975-270782-0058.flac,the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistic or considerations why do i speak of these things so benol and so well known
2013,8975-270782-0008.flac,and makes remarks which years later are we told to it but which it has itself entirely forgotten besides the memory in the early years is more file because it is less burdened than in later years
2014,8975-270782-0098.flac,if the evil impulses of the dream are merely infantilism a return to the beginnings of our ethical development since the dream simply makes children of us again in thinking and in feeling we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable
2015,8975-270782-0030.flac,only wish to warn you that you are to take into consideration not the exact terms of the dream but the meaning thereof according to its interpretation it may happen that the manifest stream of the death of some loved person has only made use of some frightful mask
2016,8975-270782-0075.flac,who were so fortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents and intimately associated therewith we find what we call the castration complex the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father
2017,8975-270782-0078.flac,that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects
2018,8975-270782-0031.flac,that it really means something entirely different or that the loved person serves as a concealing substitute for some other but the same circumstance will call forth another more difficult question you say granted this death wish was present at some time or other
2019,8975-270782-0102.flac,and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp 2 facts
2020,8975-270782-0045.flac,if the difference in age is less the child learns of the existence of the rival with intense psychic activity and accommodates himself to the new situation if the difference in age is greater the new child may awaken certain sympathies as an
2021,8975-270782-0068.flac,i do not wish to maintain that the oedipus complex covers entirely the relation of the child to its parents this relation can be much more complicated furthermore the oedipus complex is more or less well-developed it may even experience a reversal
2022,8975-270782-0100.flac,are ashamed and angry if 1 of these dreams hasn't some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form
2023,8975-270782-0046.flac,interesting object as a sort of living doll and if the difference is 8 years or more motherly impulses especially in the case of girls may come into play but to be truthful when we disclosed in a dream the wish for the death of a mother or sister
2024,8975-270782-0054.flac,and disclose the tendency to separate those of the same sex daughter from mother father from son the daughter finds in her mother the authority that hems in her will and that is entrusted with the task of causing her to carry out
2025,8975-270782-0010.flac,i must point out that certain well-preserved memories for the most part formatively experienced stand forth in this memory void which surrounds the first years of childhood and do not justify this hypothesis
2026,8975-270782-0104.flac,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even our old intellectual property
2027,8975-270782-0033.flac,in 1 of the most important points of dream study but i must remain within the bounds of our discussion and practice restraint prepare yourselves for the temporary abstention let us be satisfied with the circumstantial proof
2028,8975-270782-0056.flac,to the son the father is the embodiment of every social restriction born with such great opposition the father bars the way to freedom of will to early sexual satisfaction
2029,8975-270782-0032.flac,in a substantiated by memory yet this is no explanation it is long outlived today it can be present only in the unconscious and as an empty emotionless memory but not as a strong impulse why should it be recalled by the dream at all this question is justified
2030,8975-270782-0012.flac,they do not be speak necessarily important experiences of childhood not even such as from the viewpoint of the child need a pair of importance they are often so benile and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves and wonder why just these details
2031,8975-270782-0067.flac,ideas which we designate as the oedipus complex because this method realizes with a very slightly weakened affect the 2 extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the sun to kill his father and take his mother to wife
2032,8975-270782-0025.flac,which early ended in a separation
2033,8975-270782-0013.flac,have escaped being forgotten i once endeavored to approach the riddle of childhood amnesia and the interrupted memory remnants with the help of analysis and i arrived at the conclusion that in the case of the child too
2034,8975-270782-0094.flac,toward the understanding of the dream we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream
2035,8975-270782-0080.flac,being insensible to the conventional feeling of disgust third the incest limitation being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction with near blood relations fourth homosexuality and fifth
2036,8975-270782-0039.flac,even those persons whom the child seems to love from the very beginning it loves at the outset because it has need of them cannot do without them in other words out of egoist
2037,8975-270782-0011.flac,our memory deals selectively with its later materials with impressions which come to us in later life it retains the important and discards the unimportant this is not true of the retained childhood memories
2038,8975-270782-0051.flac,this is in accord with our expectation we find it much more offensive for love between parents and children to be lacking then for love between brothers and sisters we have so to speak made something holy in the first instance
2039,8975-270782-0072.flac,and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this proscribed or tabooed feeling relationship later made good the omission by taking all value from the complex through false interpretations according to my unchanged conviction
2040,8975-270782-0083.flac,toward those persons closest to him and who are dear to him for various reasons his parents brothers and sisters nurses and finally you may observe in him that which later breaks through again raised now to a love attraction
2041,8975-270782-0090.flac,those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what antipathy society feels towards such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it
2042,8975-270782-0023.flac,we need not hesitate to point out this origin evil wish impulses have their origin in the past often in a past which is not too far away
2043,8975-270782-0065.flac,specially between persons of the same sex has already made its influence felt in earliest childhood i mean the love rivalry with the special emphasis of the sexes character the son even as a small child
2044,8975-270782-0106.flac,but the latent dream thoughts which we have solved by means of the dream interpretation are not of this realm they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours still they are unconscious
2045,8975-270782-0084.flac,polymorphous perverse and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses it is on the 1 hand because of their lesser intensity as compared to later life and on the other hand
2046,8975-270782-0001.flac,transforms the latent dream thoughts into some other form of expression the latest in thoughts are no other than the conscious thoughts known to us in our waking hours the new mode of expression is incomprehensible to us because of its many sided features
2047,8975-270782-0029.flac,that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur
2048,8975-270782-0112.flac,why do not the sleep disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it and if they must because of the dream censorship disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible
2049,8975-270782-0019.flac,and i learned from her that he had 1 i was short and stout with his head sunk into his neck and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me this control over the forgotten material of childhood years
2050,8975-270782-0088.flac,but these things do exist they have their significance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and further ines of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man
2051,8975-270782-0018.flac,his head deeply sunk into his neck i concluded from the content that he was a physician luckily i was able to ask my mother who was still living how the physician in my birthplace which i left when i was 3 years old looked
2052,8975-270782-0060.flac,rather than that this task should be left to the cynic in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal
2053,8975-270782-0004.flac,that we shall be able to differentiate which part of the latent psychic proceedings has its source in the individual
2054,8975-270782-0074.flac,with a large number of motives in unending variations derivations and disguises also in distorted forms such as we recognized to be the work of a sensor we may also ascribe this oedipus complex to those dreamers
2055,8975-270782-0021.flac,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and lentjes sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he
2056,1502-122619-0080.flac,of various deeds and arms done in former ages his bosom was loaded with metals some massive silver and 1 or 2 even in gold
2057,1502-122619-0064.flac,he anticipated every measure on which they decided and it might almost be said
2058,1502-122619-0087.flac,whose decision was likely to produce so deep and influence on his own fortunes
2059,1502-122619-0027.flac,the other acknowledged the specific compliment by a gesture of the hand and remained silent then mwa as if were called to such a recollection by the allusion to the massacre demanded
2060,1502-122619-0003.flac,in various ways it was a prevalent opinion however
2061,1502-122619-0057.flac,the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated the women's suspended their labors to catch such syllables as on guardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors
2062,1502-122619-0017.flac,1 who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines the wise euron is welcome said the delaware
2063,1502-122619-0056.flac,a long and using pause succeeded the chief consulted a part with his companions and messages dispatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in

2065,1502-122619-0067.flac,in front of the encampment whether the warriors were already beginning to collect it might have been a half an hour before each individual including even the women and children was in his plates
2066,1502-122619-0060.flac,the oldman dispose themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tried to perform under circumstances are so much delicacy and embarrassment

2068,1502-122619-0071.flac,until such a 1 chose to make some movement no deeds and arms no natural gifts nor any renown as an orator
2069,1502-122619-0062.flac,and apparently as i'm concerned as if he had no interest in the result
2070,1502-122619-0094.flac,the chiefs drew back again to the several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment
2071,1502-122619-0049.flac,together with the material part of their physical force we're actually within the limits of the french territory accordingly this alarming annunciation was received as mwa intended
2072,1502-122619-0045.flac,then they fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends their minds are turned from their canada father this insinuation was a home thrust
2073,1502-122619-0014.flac,fortified by these assurances the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace

2077,1502-122619-0020.flac,then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge and share his warning meal the invitation was accepted and the 2 warriors attended by 3 or 4 of the old men walked calmly away

2081,1502-122619-0015.flac,he paid as he advanced many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice the women however like 1 who deemed their favored in the present enterprise of no importance
2082,1502-122619-0090.flac,with the dignity of a monarch and the heir of a father

2087,1502-122619-0047.flac,and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee
2088,1502-122619-0051.flac,he will see no change it is true my young men did not go out on the war path they had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white chief
2089,1502-122619-0066.flac,now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue
2090,1502-122619-0010.flac,when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously

2092,1502-122619-0016.flac,his reception was grave silent and weary the warriors in front stepped aside opening the way to their most approved ortor by the action
2093,1502-122619-0059.flac,in short every occupation was abandoned for the time and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge after their own peculiar manner in an open expression of feeling
2094,1502-122619-0008.flac,a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits the more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends the warriors were lounging in groups

2099,1502-122619-0048.flac,with such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements their distant villages their hunting grounds
2100,1502-122619-0089.flac,the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions
2101,1502-122619-0021.flac,leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short of frugal repast that followed

2107,1502-122619-0074.flac,and 3 men issuing from it slowly approached the place of consultation they were all aged even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached but 1 in the center who leaned on his companions for support

2110,1502-122619-0092.flac,and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person
2111,1502-122619-0025.flac,when was it ever otherwise returned mua he calls my people most beloved the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued
2112,1502-122619-0081.flac,he also wore armlets as centures above the ankles of the latter precious metal
2113,1502-122619-0093.flac,so just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the great mass of the multitude deeming in a sufficient happiness

2115,1502-122619-0082.flac,and touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks his tomahawk was nearly hidden silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure
2116,1502-122619-0073.flac,that always proceeded at conference but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally and i was raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
2117,1502-122619-0095.flac,a rose left the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning
2118,1502-122619-0054.flac,lan caribbean the delaware warriors started at the well-known name betrayed by their amazement that they now learned for the first time 1 so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power

2120,1502-122619-0084.flac,was whispered for mouth to mouth mwa had often heard the famous wise and just delaware
2121,1502-122619-0022.flac,emily is entirely to the events of the hunt and which mwa had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts
2122,1502-122619-0028.flac,does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons and the delaware is is short and it is open let her be sent to my squads if she gives trouble to my brother
2123,1502-122619-0002.flac,though they had some fit with a mysterious reserve so common among the natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of the ally
2124,1502-122619-0076.flac,the elastic light step of indian was gone and in this place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground
2125,1502-122619-0019.flac,he has come repeated magwa bidding his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist then once more exchanged friendly salutations
2126,1502-122619-0077.flac,his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders
2127,1502-122619-0061.flac,mwa had not only maintained his seat but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge
2128,1502-122619-0024.flac,is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children

2131,1502-122619-0011.flac,as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared as a furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village
2132,1502-122619-0086.flac,the urine chief therefore stopped eagerly out of a little from the throng
2133,1502-122619-0058.flac,the boys deserted their sports and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up and curious admiration as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed to the trey of their hated foe
2134,1502-122619-0096.flac,escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seed of judgment the crowd opened in a lane and when the party had re-entered
2135,1502-122619-0036.flac,it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said magwa once more shifting his ground
2136,1502-122619-0040.flac,so apply mingled with praise in the eyes of those he addressed this well judged and polite stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results
2137,1502-122619-0083.flac,which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided
2138,1502-122619-0088.flac,the americans sometimes call their toddler saint tamina a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced
2139,1502-122619-0037.flac,and gravely spread his presence before the dazzled eyes of his hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry
2140,1502-122619-0072.flac,on the presentation the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak with silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of its subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause
2141,1502-122619-0039.flac,compliments has left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contains such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity
2142,1502-122619-0034.flac,let my canada father come return the other invasively his children are ready to see him when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians of their wigwams the urines say too he is welcome

2146,1502-122619-0013.flac,by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall impressively on his breast
2147,1502-122619-0006.flac,on that morning when mwa led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers in the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people
2148,1502-122619-0043.flac,an appalachian that the french had translated into lure dior forgot that of uric of purpose
2149,1502-122619-0078.flac,since they had last been shorn the dress of this patriarch for such considering his vast age in conjunction with his affinity and affluence with his people he might very properly be termed

2151,1502-122619-0035.flac,for the yankees have long arms and legs that never tire
2152,1502-122619-0026.flac,the tomahawks of your young men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yankees are dead and the delawares are a neighbors
2153,1502-122615-0001.flac,in the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior trimble the gray head and the sagamore are safe

2156,1502-122615-0016.flac,that would have given him more satisfaction aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character however he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery spirits differ
2157,1502-122615-0015.flac,in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance at the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal
2158,1502-122615-0033.flac,the expression of his i contradicted his figurative and boastful language
2159,1502-122615-0022.flac,drew his tomahawk from his girdle and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle
2160,1502-122615-0018.flac,equals to that maintained by the chief who was in truth in your relative of the afflicted woman the minutes lingard and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in empiricism when the heroine laid aside his pipe
2161,1502-122615-0025.flac,as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant the smoked raised above their heads a little eddies
2162,1502-122615-0008.flac,prove favorable to his views and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected and advantage without seeming to hesitate
2163,1502-122615-0003.flac,but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger of the might attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh
2164,1502-122615-0032.flac,he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself i have done beaker who was the father of the young indian looked round and about him
2165,1502-122615-0021.flac,several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again
2166,1502-122615-0019.flac,and drew his robe across his breast as if about to leave the way to the lodge of the invalid just then a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door and stalking silently among the attentive group
2167,1502-122615-0020.flac,he seated himself on 1 end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast in a patient look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself an actual contact with mwa
2168,1502-122615-0002.flac,go honest and the open hand are now strangers it is enough
2169,1502-122615-0004.flac,the dying fires and the clearing cast a demon on certain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam in common glanced to the lodge and exhibited the figure of ancas
2170,1502-122615-0012.flac,he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent resolution his entertainers appear otherwise disposed
2171,1502-122615-0036.flac,suffered him to depart in silence then with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society my profitably emulate 1 of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men
2172,1502-122615-0013.flac,he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him my canada father does not forget his children said the chief
2173,1502-122615-0029.flac,like most around him for more than a minute his look too was on the ground but trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention
2174,1502-122615-0011.flac,in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition
2175,1502-122615-0023.flac,10 minutes which appeared so many ages to duncan might have passed in this manner and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke
2176,1502-122615-0010.flac,david had not reappeared no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young hearon who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed 1 side of the narrow doorway
2177,1502-122615-0024.flac,has my friend found the moose the young man's dagger under their burdens returned magua let read the bins go on the hunting path he will meet them a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name
2178,1502-122615-0000.flac,popes iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice of ankas muttered in his ear the hurons are dogs
2179,1502-122615-0034.flac,standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as his sickening at the gaze of men and veiling his face and his blanket he walked from the lodge with a noiseless step of an indian seeking
2180,1502-122615-0035.flac,in the privacy of his own abode the sympathy of 1 like himself aged forlorn and childless the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects and character
2181,1502-122615-0026.flac,leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes
2182,1502-122615-0009.flac,he walked into the lodge and took a seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts a hasty bit searching glance suffice to tell him that the anka still remains where he had left him
2183,1502-122615-0037.flac,but who has ever found a heron asleep the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magwa as he exclaimed the delawares of the lakes
2184,1502-122615-0007.flac,though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far the terror was seen that it just occurred
2185,1502-122615-0017.flac,the huron was content with the assurance and resuming his pipe he awaited the proper moment to move the impatient hayward it really excruciating the cold customs of the savages
2186,1502-122615-0031.flac,the wicked chipper was cheated by squaw
2187,1502-122615-0027.flac,the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth
2188,1502-122615-0028.flac,suffer their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white-headed savage
2189,1502-122615-0005.flac,after this termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran
2190,1502-122615-0030.flac,then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence it was a lie he said i had no son he who was called by that name is forgotten
2191,1502-122615-0006.flac,he retraced his steps to the council lodge resolved to seek and question david in order to put an end to his doubts on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution
2192,103-1241-0041.flac,was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
2193,103-1241-0032.flac,but i do hope that someday i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
2194,103-1241-0011.flac,i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that milla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that certain
2195,103-1241-0000.flac,chapter 2 matthew cathart is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mayor jogged comfortably over the 8 miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy furwood to drive through
2196,103-1241-0035.flac,and a big hat all flowers and knotting plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was mrs spencer although she generally is
2197,103-1241-0034.flac,but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagine that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worthwhile
2198,103-1241-0036.flac,she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
2199,103-1241-0033.flac,i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wsy dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopes in last winter donated 300 yards of wy to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it
2200,103-1241-0020.flac,i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a while cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
2201,103-1241-0002.flac,matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for him prince edward island you are supposed to not to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except merilla and mrs rachel
2202,103-1241-0040.flac,there'd be no scope for the imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew
2203,103-1241-0009.flac,she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here mrs alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the station master whistled
2204,103-1241-0004.flac,and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was 20 in fact he had looked at 20 very much as he looked at 60 lacking a little of the greyness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
2205,103-1241-0019.flac,i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me tonight
2206,103-1241-0016.flac,might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
2207,103-1241-0027.flac,who had been stolen away from her parents and her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at night and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones
2208,103-1241-0030.flac,isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacey make you think of she asked well now i don't know said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
2209,103-1241-0037.flac,oh there were a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloom place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
2210,103-1241-0007.flac,and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and mane matthew encountered the station master locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the 5:30 train would soon be along
2211,103-1241-0010.flac,guess there's some mistake he said mrs spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
2212,103-1241-0017.flac,with so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with 1 thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old-fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
2213,103-1241-0025.flac,it's worse than anything you can imagine mrs spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
2214,103-1241-0013.flac,and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
2215,103-1241-0018.flac,i suppose you are mr matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i am very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
2216,103-1241-0005.flac,he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature inside being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
2217,103-1241-0026.flac,they were good you know the asylum people but there was so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
2218,103-1241-0022.flac,no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shalie come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
2219,103-1241-0038.flac,and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlotte town in the red roads began to flash past i asked mrs spencer what made them red
2220,103-1241-0029.flac,the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with bloomin wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
2221,103-1241-0023.flac,it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
2222,103-1241-0012.flac,maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
2223,103-1241-0001.flac,or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breadth of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the 1 de of summer in all the year
2224,103-1241-0039.flac,and she said she didn't know him for pity sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how are you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i don't know said matthew
2225,103-1241-0042.flac,he detested the way they had of siding past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avenly type of well-bred little girl but this record which was very different
2226,103-1241-0008.flac,the 5:30 train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
2227,103-1241-0028.flac,i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthews companion stop talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
2228,103-1241-0014.flac,a child of about 11 garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish grey wy she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were 2 braids of very thick decidedly red hair
2229,103-1241-0015.flac,her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and sober her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray and others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
2230,103-1241-0031.flac,i've never seen 1 but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary might be very particular
2231,103-1241-0003.flac,he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd-looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron grey hair that touched his stooping shoulders
2232,103-1241-0021.flac,matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with a glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let merilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
2233,103-1241-0043.flac,and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
2234,103-1241-0006.flac,matthew barely noticing that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
2235,103-1241-0024.flac,we've got to drive along piece haven't we mrs spencer said it was 8 miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it for a month but that was enough
2236,103-1240-0048.flac,this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm mirilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
2237,103-1240-0016.flac,yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzle that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avenly today accordingly after tea mrs rachel set out she had not far to go
2238,103-1240-0007.flac,anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of mrs rachel's all-seeing eye she was sitting there 1 afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
2239,103-1240-0034.flac,she was actually stricken dumb for 5 seconds it was unsupervised that marilla was making fun of her but mrs rachel was almost forced to supposed are you an earnest merilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
2240,103-1240-0028.flac,yet what if matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare mrs rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unm mysterious green gables good evening rachel mela said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
2241,103-1240-0025.flac,once you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distressful of sunshine
2242,103-1240-0029.flac,how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between merilla kuffert and mrs rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
2243,103-1240-0033.flac,matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming down the train tonight if mila had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia mrs rachel could not have been more astonished
2244,103-1240-0017.flac,the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scanned quarter of a mile up the road from lynn's halo to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
2245,103-1240-0051.flac,only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or put stricken in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said milla
2246,103-1240-0001.flac,that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynn's halo it was a quiet well conducted little stream
2247,103-1240-0050.flac,and then nova scotia's right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said mrs rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
2248,103-1240-0020.flac,bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew wila are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd rather look at people to be sure
2249,103-1240-0044.flac,so matthew went to bright river to meet him mrs spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sand stationed herself mrs rachel prided herself and always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
2250,103-1240-0055.flac,it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young 1 and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather
2251,103-1240-0022.flac,set about on 1 side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardis not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for mrs rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
2252,103-1240-0027.flac,there were 3 plates laid so that mila must be expecting someone home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and 1 kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
2253,103-1240-0039.flac,so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew's getting up in years you know he's 60 and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
2254,103-1240-0042.flac,so in the end we decided to ask mrs spencer to pick us out 1 when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at cardy to bring us a smart likely boy of about 10 or 11 we decided that would be the best stage
2255,103-1240-0005.flac,helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this mrs rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted 16 of them
2256,103-1240-0013.flac,he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often mrs rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it
2257,103-1240-0014.flac,and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from merilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
2258,103-1240-0015.flac,if you'd run out of turnip seat he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
2259,103-1240-0023.flac,1 could have eaten a meal off the ground without over brimming the proverbial peck of dirt mrs rachel wrapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bitten to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
2260,103-1240-0052.flac,as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder if mrs alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a hole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
2261,103-1240-0004.flac,but mrs rachel lynde was 1 of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
2262,103-1240-0035.flac,said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated avenly farm instead of being an unheard of innovation mrs rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
2263,103-1240-0036.flac,marilla and matthew cuspert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
2264,103-1240-0010.flac,peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past 3 on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the halo and up the hill
2265,103-1240-0045.flac,well merilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what is disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
2266,103-1240-0018.flac,had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the farthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
2267,103-1240-0011.flac,and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of aan lee and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betoken that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
2268,103-1240-0026.flac,and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was late for supper mrs rachel before she had fairly closed the door
2269,103-1240-0032.flac,marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected mrs rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbors curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
2270,103-1240-0056.flac,it seems uncanny to think of a child that green gable somehow there's never been 1 there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when 1 looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
2271,103-1240-0008.flac,the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lind a meek little man whom avenly people called rachel lynn's husband was sewing his late turnip seed on the hillfield beyond the barn
2272,103-1240-0006.flac,as evan lee housekeepers will want to tell an odd voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the halo and wound up the steep red hill beyond
2273,103-1240-0053.flac,mrs rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good 2 hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bells and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
2274,103-1240-0041.flac,they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least they'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at night if we get a boring canadian
2275,103-1240-0012.flac,had it been any other man in aan lee mrs rachel deffley putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
2276,103-1240-0037.flac,what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned mara
2277,103-1240-0040.flac,there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half-grown little french boys and as soon as you do get 1 broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canaries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a homeboy but i said no flat to that
2278,103-1240-0002.flac,for not even a brook could run past mrs rachel lindor without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that mrs rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
2279,103-1240-0009.flac,mrs rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at comedy that he meant to sew his turnip seed the next afternoon
2280,103-1240-0046.flac,nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose merila and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
2281,103-1240-0031.flac,but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said mrs rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctors
2282,103-1240-0049.flac,it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything at body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
2283,103-1240-0057.flac,my but i pity him that's what so said mrs rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fullness of her heart
2284,103-1240-0047.flac,and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do merilla i'd have said for mercy sake not to think of such a thing that's what
2285,103-1240-0024.flac,or would have been cheerful if it did not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west 1 looking out on the backyard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east 1
2286,103-1240-0054.flac,and mrs rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of mrs rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated mrs rachel when she was safely out in the lane
2287,103-1240-0019.flac,barely visible from the main road along which all the other avenly houses were so socially situated mrs rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
2288,103-1240-0030.flac,thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some grey streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with 2 wire hairpin stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience in rigid conscience which she was
2289,103-1240-0000.flac,chapter 1 mrs rachel lynde is surprised mrs rachel lynde lived just where the aven lee main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
2290,103-1240-0003.flac,and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in aan lee and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbors business by dint of neglecting their own
2291,103-1240-0043.flac,old enough to be of some use in doing chores write off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram for mrs alexander spencer today the mailman brought it from the station saying they were coming on the 5:30 train tonight
2292,103-1240-0038.flac,mrs alexander spencer was up here 1 day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopton in the spring
2293,103-1240-0021.flac,they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this mrs rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
2294,311-124404-0091.flac,proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them tither proceed from the heart
2295,311-124404-0079.flac,and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart
2296,311-124404-0097.flac,thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it diverse ideas what must be understood by the common sense sensus communis in which these ideas are received by the memory which pertains them
2297,311-124404-0029.flac,to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described
2298,311-124404-0119.flac,there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue
2299,311-124404-0098.flac,by the fantasy which can change them in various ways and out of them compose new ideas and which by the same means distributing the animal spirits through the muscles can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways
2300,311-124404-0068.flac,the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted
2301,311-124404-0005.flac,and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering
2302,311-124404-0053.flac,whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with 3 besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture
2303,311-124404-0116.flac,okay number of the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be it used from the power of matter
2304,311-124404-0113.flac,since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows
2305,311-124404-0066.flac,true reasons from mere very similitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily
2306,311-124404-0104.flac,for example if touched in a particular place it may depend what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it is hurt and such like
2307,311-124404-0027.flac,and finally how from these ashes
2308,311-124404-0034.flac,but since i had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as the rest that is to say by deducing effects from their causes and by showing
2309,311-124404-0107.flac,that there are no men so dull and stupid not even idiots as to be incapable of joining together different words and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood
2310,311-124404-0103.flac,our thoughts to others for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which caused a change in its organs
2311,311-124404-0088.flac,which by being very sleepy perforated served to separate different species of grain and in the last place what above all is here worthy of observation
2312,311-124404-0047.flac,where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein and those are the 2 called the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issuing from the heart sends its branches all over the body
2313,311-124404-0121.flac,because no other causes are observer capable of destroying it
2314,311-124404-0014.flac,and ace to represent it in such a matter that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul
2315,311-124404-0114.flac,that though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions the same animals are yet observed to show not at all in many others so that the circumstance that they do better
2316,311-124404-0054.flac,and therefore as it were 2 pouches denominated the auricles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body
2317,311-124404-0023.flac,to that observed in our seas as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such as is likewise observed between the tropics have the mountains seas fountains and rivers might naturally be formed in it
2318,311-124404-0078.flac,and more vivid and warmer immediately after leaving the heart in other words when in the arteries then it was a short time before passing into either in other words when it was in the veins
2319,311-124404-0040.flac,while on the other hand i did afterwards discover these as soon as i supposed god to have created a rational soul and to have annexed it to this body and a particular manner which i described
2320,311-124404-0101.flac,an adequate to movements more admirable that is any machine of human invention and here i specially stayed to show that were there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal
2321,311-124404-0092.flac,in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point
2322,311-124404-0033.flac,from the description of inanimate bodies and plants i passed to animals and particularly to man
2323,311-124404-0051.flac,2 others at the mouth of the venus artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but precludes its return and 3 at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart
2324,311-124404-0001.flac,i believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truths are that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage
2325,311-124404-0067.flac,from the very arrangement of the parts which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience as does the motion of a clock from the power
2326,311-124404-0048.flac,i should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the 11 pelicans which like so many small valves open and shut the 4 or 7 that are in these 2 cavities
2327,311-124404-0038.flac,consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently
2328,311-124404-0093.flac,flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it
2329,311-124404-0026.flac,to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others how it can consume almost all bodies or convert them into ashes and smoke
2330,311-124404-0011.flac,i resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces
2331,311-124404-0012.flac,matter sufficient to compose 1 and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that their resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever fainted
2332,311-124404-0118.flac,that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and that's constitute a real man

2336,311-124404-0110.flac,and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species as well as among men and since some are more capable of being instructed than others it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species

2344,311-124404-0000.flac,i would hear willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which i deduced from these primary but as with the view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions
2345,311-124404-0037.flac,in which i thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit for when i examined the kind of functions which might

2348,311-124404-0004.flac,to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner
2349,311-124404-0109.flac,and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than men but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak
2350,311-124404-0074.flac,to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in 1 of the veins there must have necessity

2352,311-124404-0106.flac,these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action once it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient
2353,311-124404-0017.flac,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way
2354,311-124404-0056.flac,for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with the view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood
2355,311-124404-0075.flac,which is in a body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut
2356,311-124404-0117.flac,as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members
2357,311-124404-0058.flac,because the orphis through which they pass are wide
2358,311-124404-0077.flac,is the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins and that from the arteries can only arise from this
2359,311-124404-0086.flac,and the production of the different humors of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being verified passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive
2360,311-124404-0105.flac,a positively to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us
2361,311-124404-0046.flac,2 canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding vis the venus artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs
2362,311-124404-0094.flac,i had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treaties which i formerly thought of publishing and after these i had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscle of the human body
2363,311-124404-0083.flac,once it happens that if the blood be withdrawn from any part the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means and although the heart were as hot as glowing iron it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands
2364,311-124404-0041.flac,will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest
2365,311-124404-0059.flac,are immediately rarefied and dilated by the heat they met with in this way they caused the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the 5 small valves that are at the entrances
2366,311-124404-0057.flac,into these the blood of necessity flows from the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these 2 vessels are always full of blood and their orifice which are turned towards the heart cannot then be closed
2367,311-124404-0052.flac,but prevent its reflux nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pelicans beyond this that the orifice of the venus artery being of an oval-shaped from the nature of its situation can be adequately closed with 2
2368,311-124404-0006.flac,but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plane surface all of the different phases of a solid body select 1 of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade

2370,311-124404-0009.flac,on all the bodies that are upon the earth since they are either colored or transparent or luminous and finally on men since he is the spectator of these objects
2371,311-124404-0082.flac,and the arterial vein were not that the blood of the venus artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and verifies more readily and in a higher degree
2372,311-124404-0090.flac,descending in great abundance from the heart to the brain then penetrates through the nerves into the muscles and give motions to all the members so that to account for other parts of the blood which as most agitated and penetrating
2373,311-124404-0007.flac,fearing lest i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind i resolved to expound singly though at considerable length my opinion regarding light then
2374,311-124404-0035.flac,nature must produce them i remained satisfied with the supposition that god formed the body of man wholly like the 1 of ours as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal confirmation of the organs
2375,311-124404-0095.flac,to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth although no longer animated what changes must take place in the brain to produce
2376,311-124404-0003.flac,to accept this true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstration of the geometers had formerly appeared and yet i ventured a state that not only have i found the means
2377,311-124404-0010.flac,further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned
2378,311-124404-0049.flac,3 at the entrance of the hall of veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out 3 at the entrance to the arterial vein
2379,311-124404-0111.flac,should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least the 1 that was cracked brained unless the soul of brutes
2380,311-124404-0084.flac,and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb
2381,311-124404-0022.flac,i came next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i had expressly supposed that god had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly
2382,311-124404-0018.flac,as to present the appearance of heavens how in the meantime sum of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets and others a son and fixed stars and making a digression at this stage on the subject of light
2383,311-124404-0073.flac,i'm coming forward through the arteries because these are situated below the veins and they're coverings from their greater consistency are more difficult to compress and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them
2384,311-124404-0060.flac,of the 2 vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down to the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the 6 small valves that are in the orifice of the other 2 vessels through which they pass out
2385,311-124404-0076.flac,so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there are many other circumstances which events that what i have alleged
2386,311-124404-0044.flac,which is the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vea arteriosa inappropriately so denominated
2387,311-124404-0072.flac,the opening very tight for it is manifest that the time moderately straightened while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins cannot on that account prevent new blood
2388,311-124404-0031.flac,so that even although he had from the beginning giving it no other form than that of chaos provided only he had established certain laws of nature and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is want to do
2389,311-124404-0055.flac,and finally that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel
2390,311-124404-0045.flac,presently disperse themselves all over the lungs in the second place the cavity in the left side
2391,311-124404-0112.flac,and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brute speak although we do not understand their language
2392,311-124404-0019.flac,i expounded it considerable length with the nature of that light must be
2393,4788-94904-0010.flac,and is in direct contact with the public to it principally the hopes and fears of individuals are directed and buy it both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye
2394,4788-94904-0026.flac,a race who have been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body
2395,4788-94904-0016.flac,or of someone with whom they are connected as adherence or dependents the small class who in this state of public feeling gain the command of the representative body for the most part use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune if the executive is weak
2396,4788-94904-0007.flac,whether monarchical or popular in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made indifference to it
2397,4788-94904-0008.flac,rather than positive opposition are the obstacles to be expected these however are as fatal and may be as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion it being easier in most cases to change the direction of an active feeling than to create 1
2398,4788-94904-0035.flac,then another of the immediate oppressors his progress to ascendancy was slow but it resulted from successively taking advantage of opportunities which offered themselves only to him it was therefore sure and in proportion as it was accomplished
2399,4788-94904-0037.flac,under his protection numerous communities were formed which knew no 1 above them but the king
2400,4788-94904-0001.flac,that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them though this is not true universally for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity
2401,4788-94904-0017.flac,the country is distracted by mere struggles for place if strong it makes itself despotic at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives or such of them as are capable of giving trouble by a share of the spoil
2402,4788-94904-0030.flac,or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified by extreme passiveness
2403,4788-94904-0031.flac,and ready submission to tyranny if a people thus prostrated by character and circumstances could obtain representative institutions they would inevitably choose their tyrants as their representatives and the yoke would be made heavier on them by the contrivance which
2404,4788-94904-0022.flac,they would certainly as in spanish america keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war a desperate not even legal but of illegal violence would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers
2405,4788-94904-0014.flac,these considerations relate to the first 2 causes of failure and a representative government the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution
2406,4788-94904-0018.flac,and the only fruit produced by national representation is that in addition to those who really govern there is an assembly quartered on the public and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are interested is at all likely to be removed
2407,4788-94904-0009.flac,in a state previously passive when a people have no sufficient value for and attachment to our representative constitution they have next to no chance of retaining it
2408,4788-94904-0013.flac,they seldom obtain a footing at all and if they do are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government or any party leader who can muster force for a coup deming is willing to run some small risk for absolute power
2409,4788-94904-0033.flac,even when the king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief feudatories the great advantage which he derived from being but 1 has been recognized by french historians to him the eyes of all the locally oppressed were turned
2410,4788-94904-0015.flac,when nobody or only some small fraction feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion the electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their private interest or the interest of their locality
2411,4788-94904-0024.flac,there are others in which it possibly might exist but in which some other form of government would be preferable these are principally when the people in order to advance in civilization have some lesson to learn some habit not yet acquired
2412,4788-94904-0011.flac,unless therefore the authorities whose office it is to check the executive of our backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive is always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience
2413,4788-94904-0027.flac,a representative assembly drawn from among themselves would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination it would refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose on their savage independence any improving restraint
2414,4788-94904-0002.flac,as a part of the degree in which they possess certain special requisites requisites however so closely connected with their degree of general advancement that any variation between the 2 is rather the exception than the rule
2415,4788-94904-0034.flac,he was the object of hope and reliance throughout the kingdom while each local potentate was only powerful within a more or less confined space at his hands refuge and protection were sought from every part of the country against first 1
2416,4788-94904-0029.flac,but as it is merely personal it rarely affects any change in the general habits of the people unless the prophet like muhammad is also a military chief and goes forth the armed apostle of a new religion
2417,4788-94904-0019.flac,when however the evil stops here the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which though not an invariable are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation
2418,4788-94904-0023.flac,and the name in forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent desper from attaining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized
2419,4788-94904-0004.flac,who have gained power over the country are disposed to offer at the bun to individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant since if no other objection can be made to their enterprise then that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side
2420,4788-94904-0020.flac,that the place hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly though they contribute little or nothing directly to good government nor even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive
2421,4788-94904-0028.flac,a military leader is the only superior to whom they will submit except occasionally some profit supposed to be inspired from above or conjurer regarded as possessing miraculous power these may exercise a temporary ascendancy
2422,4788-94904-0032.flac,might be expected to lighten it on the contrary many people has gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central authority whose position has made it the rival and has ended by making it the master of the local despite
2423,4788-94904-0012.flac,and is sure to be well supported in doing so representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of there being endangered if too little valued for this
2424,4788-94904-0021.flac,which exists in that country this benefit however is entirely dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary king if instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler these selfish and sorted factions struggled for the chief place itself
2425,4788-94904-0003.flac,that they should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the functions which it imposes on them the willingness of the people to accept representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler or a foreign nation or nations
2426,4788-94904-0039.flac,though generally much restricted in practice was mainly instrumental in carrying the people through a necessary stage of improvement which representative government if real would most likely have prevented them from entering upon
2427,4788-94904-0000.flac,we have recognized and representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement as they range lower and lower in development
2428,4788-94904-0005.flac,they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at when opinion is really adverse its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself
2429,4788-94904-0038.flac,and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation in this manner a central power despotic and principal
2430,4788-94904-0006.flac,the contrary case is not indeed unexampled there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be
2431,4788-94904-0036.flac,it abated in the oppressed portion of the community the habit of submitting to oppression the king's interests lay an encouraging all partial attempts on the part of the surfs to emancipate themselves from the masters and place themselves in immediate subordination to himself
2432,4788-94904-0025.flac,to the acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an impediment the most obvious of these cases is the 1 already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization that of obedience
2433,4788-294466-0011.flac,when jerry and i were little we were playmates i spent days at the ranch sometimes her sweet face was very sad as she ended with until mother died when i was 8 then you came east to boarding school and became like a sister to me

2436,4788-294466-0014.flac,noticing the dora was deep in thought she asked slightly won't you say it out loud why of course i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loon's rock house because he had to do the milking mary replied simply
2437,4788-294466-0021.flac,door exclaimed as she rode close to the porch thanks a lot she called brightly up to the old man who was handing the packet down over the sagging wooden rail his friendly toothless smile was directed at the smaller girl
2438,4788-294466-0012.flac,far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them

2440,4788-294466-0006.flac,they're nice boys aren't they mary said i've always wished i had a brother and i do believe jerry is going to be just like 1 allowed dora replied i have noticed that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought
2441,4788-294466-0031.flac,then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom she asked eagerly may i tell dad an adventure we've had mrs farley middle-aged kind faced shook her head smiling down at the girl not tonight please won't tomorrow do
2442,4788-294466-0000.flac,mary's nettlesome brown pony was hard to quiet until jerry reached out a strong brown hand and patted its head mary lifted startled blue eyes jerry what do you make of that she asked
2443,4788-294466-0023.flac,pale feller with specs on is her son 80 yes mr harvey dick is mrs farley's son mary took time in a friendly way to satisfy the old man's curiosity
2444,4788-294466-0009.flac,when she spoke she said it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have my mother met dad in bisbee where he was a mining engineer
2445,4788-294466-0004.flac,she smiled at her friend mary not wishing to appear foolishly timid said in his courageous a voice as she could muster of course we're not afraid goodbye boys we'll see you tomorrow
2446,4788-294466-0005.flac,feeling assured that the girls were all right the boys went at a gallop down the road and across the desert valley to the newcomb ranch
2447,4788-294466-0028.flac,a bright black eyed mexican boy of about 10 ran out to the road as the girls approached come on emanuel mary sang down to him you may put up our horses and earn a dime the small boys white teeth flashed in a delighted grin
2448,4788-294466-0017.flac,i'm crazy about mysteries as you know and if there really is 1 about that rock house i want to try to solve it she said no more about it just then as they had reached the old ghost town of gleason
2449,4788-294466-0024.flac,dick has been going to the arizona state university this winter to be near his mother she's a widow and he's her only son her husband was a doctor and they lived back in boston before he died do tell the old man wagged his head sympathetically
2450,4788-294466-0030.flac,it's broad porch and adobe pillars hear her mother had come as a bride here mary had been born 8 happy years they had spent together before her mother died after mary had been taken east to school her father had returned
2451,4788-294466-0002.flac,he must have been dead for years if he was old when jerry's father was a boy of course door a less inclined to be imaginative replied then to the cowboy she said in her practical matter of fact way
2452,4788-294466-0007.flac,oh mary how blind you are dreamy the younger girl was saying that's because we were playmates when we were little so very long ago oh my how ancient we are dora said teasingly
2453,4788-294466-0027.flac,some with broken windows and doors others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls the only sign of life was in 3 small adobe's where poor mexican families lived broken windows and 2 of the houses were stuffed with rags
2454,4788-294466-0018.flac,in the long ago days when the town had been teeming with life picturesque looking miners and ranchers had sat there tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns today the chairs were empty an old man shriveled
2455,4788-294466-0022.flac,he said miss farley your nurse woman came down to a mail some letters a spell back then before mary could reply he continued in his shrill wavering voice
2456,4788-294466-0013.flac,it was very still not a sound was to be heard now and then a rabbit darted past silently how peaceful this hour is on the desert mary began glancing at her friend who was riding so close at her side
2457,4788-294466-0016.flac,i don't believe he will tell us about that i acted so like a scare cat all the time we were there he won't ever take us there again and he probably won't tell us the story either then i'll find it out some other way dora declared
2458,4788-294466-0025.flac,busting brocks mary smiled and appreciation of the old man's joke no jerry won't expect dick to do that right at first he's official fenceman are just at present dora defended the absent boy mr harvey
2459,4788-294466-0029.flac,his brown feet raced so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square 2 story adobe near the mountains and manual was there to lead their horses around back mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flowered edged walk
2460,4788-294466-0008.flac,please remember that you are only 1 year younger than i am and i refused to be called elderly mary smiled faintly but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist a wonderfully pretty wistful little girl
2461,4788-294466-0019.flac,grey bearded uncapped but with kind gray eyes deep sunken under shaggy browse stood in the open door he smiled out at them in a friendly way then beckoned with a bony finger
2462,4788-294466-0001.flac,we couldn't have imagined that gunshot and surely the horses heard it also jerry's smile was reassuring it was the story that frightened you girls i reckon he said glancing about and up and down the road as he spoke
2463,4788-294466-0003.flac,hurry along home to your milking jerry and dick don't you bother to come with us now that you're working on the newcom ranch you ought to be there it's only a few miles up over this sunshiny road to gleason we aren't the least bit afraid to ride home alone are we
2464,4788-294466-0015.flac,dora noted so he said then she hastened to add oh don't think i'm inferring that jerry told an untruth but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glanced up startled dora bellman she said
2465,4788-91208-0034.flac,and all his relations to his fellow creatures the very birds about his dwelling seemed to recognize it it is this noble sentiment which infuses a soul of life into his teachings and the annunciation and acting out of which constitute him
2466,4788-91208-0028.flac,in which these contradictory attributes in here but it was against a corresponding being the infinite that mr mill was arguing it is this that he calls a
2467,4788-91208-0027.flac,by a mistake he fell into the necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete he acknowledged the force of mr mills argument that the infinite must include a farago of contradictions
2468,4788-91208-0024.flac,of the contradictory of a proposition is a proof of its truth co-equal with experience but that its value transcends experience experience may tell us what is but it is by the impossibility of conceiving it otherwise
2469,4788-91208-0030.flac,and prescribed to him a rule of life that person has a religion and though everyone naturally prefers his own religion to any other all must admit that if the object of his attachment and of this feeling of duty is the aggregate of our fellow creatures
2470,4788-91208-0033.flac,never has the liable of humanity involved in the current theology been more forcibly pointed out with its constant appeal to low motives of personal gain
2471,4788-91208-0032.flac,and we join with him in condemning as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange and eternity a personal enjoyment
2472,4788-91208-0031.flac,this religion of the infidel cannot in honesty and conscience be called an intrinsically bad 1 many indeed may be unable to believe that this object is capable of gathering around it feelings sufficiently strong
2473,4788-91208-0029.flac,and regarded as the reductio ad and sodium of the transcendental philosophy mr mills religious tendencies may very well be gathered from a passage in his review of august compt a philosopher with whom he agreed on all points
2474,4788-91208-0026.flac,as mr mill says the name of god is veiled under 2 extremely abstract phrases the infinite and the absolute so profound and friendly a thinker as the late mr grow held this raising of the veil in expedient but he proved
2475,4788-91208-0025.flac,in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy mr mill gives battle to this mode of thought after reviewing in an opening chapter the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge
2476,4788-91208-0006.flac,of the mass of original thought that still remains to mr mills credit the great critical power that could gather valuable truths from so many discordant sources and the wonderful synthetic ability required to weld these and his own contributions
2477,4788-91208-0014.flac,but are now dead we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal we might surely without any logical and consequence have concluded at once from those instances that the duke of wellington is mortal
2478,4788-91208-0019.flac,and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin it was this take him with his theory of the syllogism which worked the great change both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy
2479,4788-91208-0008.flac,in deducing from general propositions other propositions less general it was even asserted confidently that nothing more was to be expected than an inductive logic was impossible this conception of logical science necessitated
2480,4788-91208-0007.flac,into 1 organic hole when mr mill commenced his labors the only logic recognized was the syllogistic
2481,4788-91208-0022.flac,the biggest lion in the path was the doctrine of so-called necessary truth this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth and a standard as he was easily able to show
2482,4788-91208-0013.flac,was bought in perfectly realized and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of mr mill altered all this he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars noir from particulars to generals but from particulars to particulars
2483,4788-91208-0015.flac,the mortality of john thomas and others is after all the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the duke of wellington not 1 iota is added to the proof by interpolating a general proposition
2484,4788-91208-0010.flac,incapable of being proved from other propositions it followed that if they were known to us at all they must be original data of consciousness here was a perfect paradise of question begging the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed
2485,4788-91208-0016.flac,we not only met according to mr mill reason from some particular instances to others but we frequently do so as however the instances which are sufficient to prove 1 fresh instance
2486,4788-91208-0018.flac,all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic and to induction accordingly mr mill devoted his chief attention for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic
2487,4788-91208-0003.flac,mr mills achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society he is
2488,4788-91208-0011.flac,it could of course be fashioned according to the particular conclusion it was called in to prove thus an artificial ignorance as lot calls it was produced which had the effect of sanctifying prejudice by recognizing so-called necessities of thought
2489,4788-91208-0004.flac,the structure raised by adam smith malthus and ricardo but raised it at least 1 story higher his inestimable system of logic was a revolution it hardly needs of course to be said that he owed much to his predecessors
2490,4788-91208-0005.flac,that he borrowed from weewell much of his classification from brown the chief lines of his theory of causation from sir john herschel the main principles of the inductive methods those who think this a disparagement of his work must have very little conception
2491,4788-91208-0001.flac,the pointsman moves a handle and the foaming giant that would it may be have sped onto his destruction and that of the passive crew who follow in his rear is shunted to another line running in a different direction and to a more desirable goal
2492,4788-91208-0012.flac,as the only basis of reasoning it is true that outside of the logic of the school's great advances had been made in the rules of scientific investigation but these rules were not only imperfect in themselves but their connection with the law of causation
2493,4788-91208-0009.flac,some general propositions to start with and these general propositions being
2494,4788-91208-0002.flac,the great intellectual pointsman of our age the man who has done more than any other of this generation to give direction to the thought of his contemporaries has passed away and we are left to measure the loss to humanity by the result of his labors
2495,4788-91208-0023.flac,varying according to the psychological history of the individual such thinkers as dr we-well and mr herbert spencer had to be met in intellectual combat dr weewell held not that the inconceivably
2496,4788-91208-0000.flac,it looks big and important and it makes a great noise even people a long way up in the scale of civilization are in the habit of taking these attributes perhaps not as the essential ones of leadership but at all events as those by which a leader may be recognized
2497,4788-91208-0017.flac,the work of deduction is the interpretation of these formulas and therefore strictly speaking is not inferential at all the real inference was accomplished when the universal proposition was arrived at
2498,4788-91208-0020.flac,are for the most part devoted to fortifying this position and demolishing the beliefs inconsistent with it as a systematic psychologist mr mill has not done so much as either professor bane or mr herbert spencer
2499,4788-91208-0021.flac,the perfection of his method its application and the uprooting of prejudices which stood in its way this was the task to which mr mill applied himself with an ability and success rarely matched and never surpassed
2500,2989-138035-0010.flac,and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents
2501,2989-138035-0019.flac,and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error
2502,2989-138035-0072.flac,but abundant enough to feed an army
2503,2989-138035-0051.flac,wearing an account is given of the wedding of kamacho the rich together with the incident of basilio the poor
2504,2989-138035-0047.flac,other singing others playing the various instruments already mentioned
2505,2989-138035-0069.flac,there was a wall made of cheeses arranged like an open brick work and 2 cauldrons full of oil
2506,2989-138035-0054.flac,that without envying or being envied sleepest
2507,2989-138035-0009.flac,nor of the many others i have admitted to mention
2508,2989-138035-0043.flac,the resolve to push on so as to reach the village of couter to which they all belonged in good time during the remainder of the journey the lenti held forth to them on the excellences of the sword with such conclusive arguments and such figures and mathematical proofs
2509,2989-138035-0015.flac,and above all handles the sword as well as the best
2510,2989-138035-0003.flac,which was that of a night aaron seeking adventures in all parts of the world he informed them that his own name was donkeyote of lamancha and that he was called by way of surname the night of the lions all this was greek or gibberish to the peasants
2511,2989-138035-0011.flac,so that the loves of the 2 children basilio and criteria
2512,2989-138035-0060.flac,senor it's my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get
2513,2989-138035-0038.flac,the end of it was it the last entiate reckoned up for him the thrust every 1 of the buttons of the short kasaki war tore up the skirts into strips like the tales of a cuttlefish knocked off his hat twice and so completely tired him out
2514,2989-138035-0027.flac,poverty wealth and blair eyes pearls what art thou driving at sancho curses on thee said donkey xote
2515,2989-138035-0014.flac,both over the 9 pens as if by magic
2516,2989-138035-0029.flac,but no matter i understand myself and i know i am not said anything very foolish in what i have said only your worships and your is always gravelling at everything i say nay everything i do
2517,2989-138035-0062.flac,but when such gives fall to 1 that has hard cash i wish my condition of life was is becoming as they are
2518,2989-138035-0057.flac,he woke at last drowsy and lazy and casting his eyes about in every direction observed there comes if i don't mistake
2519,2989-138035-0071.flac,the spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter and all lay open to view in a great chest
2520,2989-138035-0016.flac,say that to my wife said sancho who had until now listened in silence for she won't hear of anything but each 1 marrying his equal holding with the proverb each ew to her like
2521,2989-138035-0075.flac,and so saying he sees a bucket and plunging it into 1 of the half jars took up 3 hens and a couple of geese
2522,2989-138035-0036.flac,though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you placed your foot the first time i mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword
2523,2989-138035-0073.flac,contemplate it all and everything won his heart the first to captivate and take his fancy with the pots
2524,2989-138035-0002.flac,made them an offer of his company and begged them to slack in their pace as their young asses traveled faster than his horse and then to gratify them he told them in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed
2525,2989-138035-0065.flac,and even if it were so i desire you to hold your tongue and come along for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning and not in the heat of the afternoon
2526,2989-138035-0000.flac,and which is related to the adventure of the enamored shepherd together with other truly droll incidents donkeyote had gone but a short distance beyond don diego's village when he fell in with a couple of either priest or students and a couple of peasants
2527,2989-138035-0031.flac,and yet they are all to lead in pure correct
2528,2989-138035-0055.flac,to interfere with our repose ambition breaks not thy rest nor doth this world's empty pomp disturb thee for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass

2530,2989-138035-0006.flac,as the bridegroom is called kamacho the rich she is 18 and he 22 and they are fairly matched though some knowing ones who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart will have it that the family of the fair quiteria is better than kamacho
2531,2989-138035-0061.flac,and if that be so as no doubt it is
2532,2989-138035-0033.flac,where you are now tail look here bachelor and quello return the lenti you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword if you think it useless it is no idea on my part but an established truth

2534,2989-138035-0041.flac,they can put the point of a sword through the eye of a needle i'm satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey said kuo and with having had the truth i was so ignorant of proved to me by experience and getting up he embraced the licentiate
2535,2989-138035-0039.flac,that in vexation anger and rage he took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force that 1 of the peasants that were there who was a notary and who went for it made an affidavit afterwards that he sent it nearly 3/4 of a league
2536,2989-138035-0058.flac,a wedding that begins with smells like that by my faith ought to be plentiful and unstinting have done thou glutton said donkey xote come let us go and witness this bridal and see what the rejected basilio does

2539,2989-138035-0077.flac,well then said the cook takes spoon and all for kamacho wealth and happiness furnish everything
2540,2989-138035-0063.flac,for god's sake sancho said donkey xote here
2541,2989-138035-0020.flac,why then should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting place of death more specially when the companion has to be his companion in bed at board and everywhere as the wife is to her husband
2542,2989-138035-0023.flac,that he might be taken for a closed statue with its drapery stirred by the wind in short he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering that all we who know him
2543,2989-138035-0012.flac,he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich kamacho
2544,2989-138035-0067.flac,they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons
2545,2989-138035-0024.flac,and any 1 of them or any moment the house may fall i have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all at 1 time
2546,2989-138035-0056.flac,since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the support of thyself the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom have imposed upon masters the servant sleeps and the master lies awake thinking of how he is to feed him advance him and reward him
2547,2989-138035-0007.flac,but no 1 mindsets at any rate kamacho is free-handed
2548,2989-138035-0052.flac,scarce had the fair aurora given bright feebas time to dry the liquid pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays when donkey xote shaking off sloth from his limbs
2549,2989-138035-0017.flac,if all those who love 1 another were to marry you said donkey xote it would deprive parents of the right to choose and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased
2550,2989-138035-0034.flac,and these joined with my resolution which is not small will make you confess that i am not mistaken dismount and put it in practice your positions and circles and angles and science so i hope to make you see stars at noon day with my rude raw swordsmanship
2551,2989-138035-0021.flac,he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter rational word and he always goes about moody and dejected talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses he eats little and sleeps little and all he eats is fruit and when he sleeps
2552,2989-138035-0046.flac,we're filled with lights unaffected by the wind for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees the musicians were the life of the wedding wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands some dancing
2553,2989-138035-0068.flac,of over 6 gallons each and all filled as it proved afterwards with generous wines there were besides piles of the widest bread like the heaps of corn 1 seeds on the threshing floors
2554,2989-138035-0048.flac,we're frisking and gambling all over the meadow
2555,2989-138035-0005.flac,who is called part excellence
2556,2989-138035-0078.flac,donkey xote was watching the entrance at 1 end of the arcade of some 12 peas all in holiday and gala dress
2557,2989-138035-0066.flac,and 6 stew pots that stood around the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mold of common pots for they were 6 half wine jars each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house
2558,2989-138035-0049.flac,even where it under guilded ceilings and so turned aside a little out of the road
2559,2989-138035-0018.flac,1 would be for choosing her father's servant and another someone she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken bully
2560,2989-138035-0030.flac,maybe there to lead in who do not hit it off when it comes to polish talk that is true said the lenti for those who have been bred up in the tanneries
2561,2989-138035-0001.flac,and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that everyone felt who saw a donkey xote for the first time and were dying to know who this man so different from ordinary men could be donkey xote saluted them and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his
2562,2989-138035-0032.flac,though they may have been born in mahalo honda i say of discrimination because there are many who are not so and discrimination is the grammar of good language if it be accompanied by practice i sayers for my sins have studied canon law at salamanca
2563,2989-138035-0040.flac,by my faith senor bachelor if your worship takes my advice you will never challenge anyone to fence again only to wrestle and throw the bar for you have the youth and strength for that but as for these spencers as they call them i have heard say
2564,2989-138035-0013.flac,who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the truth be told ungrudgingly he is the most agile youth we know a mighty thor of the bar a first rate wrestler and a great ball player he runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat
2565,2989-138035-0004.flac,for all that however they regarded him with admiration and respect and 1 of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed road as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship come with us
2566,2989-138035-0044.flac,it grew dark but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if they was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it they heard to the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments flutes drums
2567,2989-138035-0050.flac,as to the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don diego came back to his mind
2568,2989-138035-0026.flac,for love i have heard say
2569,2989-138035-0053.flac,sprang to his feet and called to his squire sancho who is still snoring
2570,2989-138035-0025.flac,and tell me is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune no faith and between a woman's yes and no i wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin
2571,2989-138035-0035.flac,who will make me turn my back and that there is not 1 in the world i will not compel to give ground as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself replied the master of fence
2572,2989-138035-0022.flac,if he sleeps at all it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast sometimes he gazes at the sky
2573,2989-138035-0070.flac,and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by of cooks and cook maids there were over 50 all clean brisk and ble in the capacious belly of the ox where a dozen soft little suckling pigs which sewn up there
2574,2989-138035-0074.flac,get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or 2 and much good may they do you i don't see 1 says sancho wait a bit said the cook center that i am how particular and bashful you are
2575,2989-138035-0042.flac,and they were better friends than ever and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword
2576,2989-138035-0008.flac,he has provided dancers too not only sword but also bell dancers for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection of shoe dancers i say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things
2577,2989-138035-0037.flac,but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the lenti sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset and made him kiss it as if it were a relic so not as devoutly as relics are and ought to be kissed

2590,2989-138028-0025.flac,for it would be impossible now to find 1 of their descendants and even should we find 1 it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebeian lineages i have nothing to say say that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
2591,2989-138028-0028.flac,even though he know him not will fail to recognize and set him down as 1 of good blood and it would be strange for it not so praise has ever been the reward of virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation

2598,2989-138028-0073.flac,samson's intention and persuading him to sell a fourth once more was to do what the history relates further on
2599,2989-138028-0074.flac,with whom he had previously discussed the subject
2600,2989-138028-0037.flac,so that to bring him around again ever so little cost me more than 600 eggs
2601,2989-138028-0006.flac,there's a great difference between 1 and another for the courtiers without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst

2611,2989-138028-0038.flac,that it can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say 1 thing for another so they were to burst for it and short then mistress housekeeper that is all
2612,2989-138028-0047.flac,but to come to the point what does theza say tuapse says
2613,2989-138028-0044.flac,once or twice as well as i remember replied sancho
2614,2989-138028-0035.flac,at this moment there came a knocking at the door
2615,2989-138028-0011.flac,and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armor the shells of a certain fish
2616,2989-138028-0041.flac,i know what i'm saying mrs housekeeper
2617,2989-138028-0029.flac,there are 2 roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and honors 1 is that of letters the other that of arms
2618,2989-138028-0040.flac,that would do if it was the toothache my master had
2619,2989-138028-0059.flac,any longer curbs and checked for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs

2621,2989-138028-0027.flac,but above all by being charitable 4x 2 maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing and knowing that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues i have named
2622,2989-138028-0030.flac,i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road
2623,2989-138028-0063.flac,let this new samsung remain in his own country and bringing honor to it bring honor at the same time on the grey heads of the venerable parents for i will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not dean to accompany me
2624,2989-138028-0032.flac,i know too the infinite blessings that are tainted by it i know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of vice broad and spacious i know their ends and goals are different for the broad and easy roads of vice ends in death
2625,2989-138028-0072.flac,poured out on the bachelor were past counting they tore their hair they clawed their faces and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion

2633,2989-138028-0020.flac,all the lineages in the world attend to what i'm saying can be reduced to 4 sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they had attained surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintain them
2634,2989-138028-0069.flac,as he was there described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be revoked

2637,2989-138028-0056.flac,the arch wag samson came forward and embracing him as he had done before i said with a loud voice oh flower of night aaron tree oh shining light of arms oh honor and mirror of the spanish nation
2638,2989-138028-0014.flac,i would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be the young hussey that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticize the histories of knights errant
2639,2989-138028-0017.flac,and 1 has native experience and discernment to distinguish these 2 kinds of gentlemen
2640,2989-138028-0015.flac,for he was the most humble minded and courteous night of his time

2644,2989-138028-0021.flac,and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness
2645,2989-138028-0022.flac,those that had a humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve
2646,2989-138028-0008.flac,nor do we only know enemies in pictures but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat whether 1 has or has not a shorter lands or sword
2647,2989-138028-0046.flac,and submit to what i teach the i would bet said sancho that from the very first you understood me and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders maybe so reply donkey xote
2648,2989-138028-0019.flac,and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above all a kabayo when you are not 1
2649,2989-138028-0066.flac,no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives 1 to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow which i can't deny i will be 1 in my own house too that who will take it a miss
2650,2989-138028-0013.flac,and it would be well if there were no prints who did not set a higher value on the second or more properly speaking first kind of nights errand for as we read in their histories
2651,2989-138028-0042.flac,replied carrasco and with this the housekeeper retired
2652,2989-138028-0054.flac,been a quidam but if not we remain friends for if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not like pigeons and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and a good grievance better than a bad compensation
2653,2989-138028-0058.flac,but i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor donkeyote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience that i not urge and persuade this night not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit
2654,2989-138028-0070.flac,and fine donkey xote and sancho embraced 1 another and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who is now the oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place 3 days then by which time they could have
2655,7113-86041-0047.flac,and gathered the golden apples from the trees and when they were tired of this amusement the princess let her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace until at last they came to the 1 in which were kept all the marvelous dresses and ornaments
2656,7113-86041-0031.flac,the scene of this strange adventure thinking as people will and sorrow that there might be some mistake after all but when he reached the spot behold all was changed again
2657,7113-86041-0014.flac,beyond them float a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noon tide
2658,7113-86041-0026.flac,running hither and thither and high glee and calling merrily to each other at last when they were quite wary the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool
2659,7113-86041-0042.flac,who is there i can find for her to talk to
2660,7113-86041-0009.flac,but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful and raisel soon left him and went to be shepherd to his next neighbor
2661,7113-86041-0023.flac,as the wandering breeze scattered it daisies and forget me nots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable
2662,7113-86041-0085.flac,unless he could be forever chattering
2663,7113-86041-0002.flac,for a basil loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing
2664,7113-86041-0079.flac,caught him in her cruel beak and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat these 2 unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more
2665,7113-86041-0055.flac,to take part in the games of the princess to that last 1 fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay play fellows she shuddered
2666,7113-86041-0043.flac,carrots turnips and radishes and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who set pensive in the shade of the rose bower loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow
2667,7113-86041-0022.flac,the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed float in silence now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt
2668,7113-86041-0033.flac,the king was so much perplexed that he threatened a princess's play fellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some
2669,7113-86041-0045.flac,take this little mini colored wand and with a touch give to each route the form you desire to see with this he left her and the princess without an instance delay open the basket
2670,7113-86041-0086.flac,all his gloom and misery vanished and a moment and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learned so he soon fluttered away
2671,7113-86041-0059.flac,sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will do but do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots
2672,7113-86041-0048.flac,the gnome had given to his hoped for bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes fails girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired
2673,7113-86041-0006.flac,came the music of the shepherd's pipe the strangeness and the pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests who would that saying by your leave or with your leave
2674,7113-86041-0093.flac,and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now
2675,7113-86041-0017.flac,when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young man that was the best way and he fell in love with a girl then and there
2676,7113-86041-0065.flac,dear queen of my heart answered he i pray you would have forgive my carelessness i promised more than i could perform i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty sellers
2677,7113-86041-0062.flac,and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow
2678,7113-86041-0110.flac,to the depths of his underground kingdom
2679,7113-86041-0077.flac,then and there after that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting hop little cricket tatore and chirp in his ear that i love him only
2680,7113-86041-0103.flac,but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name but only
2681,7113-86041-0100.flac,into the arms of her beloved prince ratibor meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again to his back ache and his head swam and he could no longer put 2 and 2 together
2682,7113-86041-0082.flac,now prince raore was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief 1 day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud
2683,7113-86041-0088.flac,she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might someday return his love and the idea pleased him mightily the next day
2684,7113-86041-0091.flac,your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this fail still to hide my blushes and tears why tears beloved 1 cry the gnome anxiously
2685,7113-86041-0078.flac,but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains so the cricut hopped off galilee determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a long-legged stalk who was prancing along the same road
2686,7113-86041-0012.flac,down to his underground palace very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind but as time went on he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him and thought he would take another look at the upper world
2687,7113-86041-0054.flac,while brunilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away
2688,7113-86041-0029.flac,but which had swallowed up the princess before their eyes they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her but in vain they only floated like quarks in the enchanted pool and could not keep underwater for a second
2689,7113-86041-0041.flac,and in a thousand waves drove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants
2690,7113-86041-0076.flac,so the b spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up
2691,7113-86041-0090.flac,and her flowing veils sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes
2692,7113-86041-0000.flac,riezl over all the vast underworld the mountain gnome re basil was lord and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through
2693,7113-86041-0074.flac,for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter had now come to their full size day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them conjuring up now this longed for person and now that
2694,7113-86041-0080.flac,this time she changed the turnip into a magpie flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said she till you come to rab my love
2695,7113-86041-0001.flac,and the hosts of gnomes to be kept their tasks some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapors to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies
2696,7113-86041-0060.flac,the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired but as the sap dried up they withered away but never trouble yourself about that dearest 1 a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right
2697,7113-86041-0005.flac,and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounded cozy-looking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the are sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows
2698,7113-86041-0013.flac,we're stood a charming maiden fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon around her upon the grass lay her young companions as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some mary game
2699,7113-86041-0073.flac,in her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity and at last she hid upon a plan by this time spring wants more rain in the valley and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth
2700,7113-86041-0039.flac,and nightingale sang in every bush as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys sometimes gazing at the moon sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment
2701,7113-86041-0098.flac,pretty looks and words as for the maiden no sooner was her diluted lover fairly out of sight then she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand
2702,7113-86041-0064.flac,by the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off
2703,7113-86041-0018.flac,the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country and she often wondered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits till the midday he drove the merry band to the shady lawn
2704,7113-86041-0024.flac,were spread out strange fruits and sweet meets the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes
2705,7113-86041-0032.flac,the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished and so had the marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old
2706,7113-86041-0019.flac,by the brook to rest or to bathe in the cool waters on this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood this
2707,7113-86041-0028.flac,and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair loudly did they weep and wail running about the brink of the pool which looked so shallow and so clear
2708,7113-86041-0057.flac,lay the once frolic some benny with all 4 feet stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion the horrified princess fled to the door
2709,7113-86041-0040.flac,but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome however he soon perceived her melancholy
2710,7113-86041-0068.flac,and disguising himself as a farmer bought an ass in the nearest market town and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip carrot and radish seed with this he sold a great field
2711,7113-86041-0051.flac,she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand and soon had all her maidens about her and even as she had 2 tiny radishes to spare
2712,7113-86041-0097.flac,this time to his great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princesses
2713,7113-86041-0053.flac,they played from morning to night only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and won and the mirror and the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom
2714,7113-86041-0094.flac,ask some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love beat so answered the crafty maiden then give me
2715,7113-86041-0038.flac,on 3 sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady which pleased the eye of the princess the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples
2716,7113-86041-0104.flac,the echo answered in the marble halls there was neither voice nor footstep then he began to perceive that something was a miss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace
2717,7113-86041-0010.flac,and we're among the hills to look for any who strayed away that they too prospered under his care and not 1 was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well-earned wages
2718,7113-86041-0084.flac,but the magpie and the tree who like
2719,7113-86041-0075.flac,just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another purpose in view 1 day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover fly
2720,7113-86041-0087.flac,while the prince hurried back to his castle to gather together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall cess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of escape
2721,7113-86041-0035.flac,they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her fathers seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch
2722,7113-86041-0044.flac,no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling
2723,7113-86041-0070.flac,he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him but that was a mistake for the truth was that another image already filled her heart the young prince ratibor whose lands joined her fathers had won the heart of the princess
2724,7113-86041-0021.flac,weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed and when the maidens returned at noon to their favorite resting place they stood lost and amazement and almost fancied that they must be dreaming
2725,7113-86041-0034.flac,brighter goblin and try to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy
2726,7113-86041-0008.flac,he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man so taking the form of an old field laborer he entered the service of a farmer under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly
2727,7113-86041-0016.flac,he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels and a nest of field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens
2728,7113-86041-0109.flac,and the for second gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures
2729,7113-86041-0015.flac,the side of the maiden so pleased the gnome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven
2730,7113-86041-0069.flac,and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch intended and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds thus fostered they grew and flourished marvelously
2731,7113-86041-0036.flac,wrapped in a wonderful robe satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he was told her all about himself
2732,7113-86041-0037.flac,and his great underground kingdom and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the side of so much splendor
2733,7113-86041-0049.flac,and showed so much taste that nobody
2734,7113-86041-0108.flac,he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princess's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief all was lonely empty sorrowful
2735,7113-86041-0007.flac,nor did he wish to interfere with their doings but left them in quiet possession of their homes as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves
2736,7113-86041-0107.flac,and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the 4 wins his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stall once more through every room with many size and lamentations
2737,7113-86041-0052.flac,whose name was benny and now all went to cheerfully in the castle the princess gave to each of the maidens her tasks and never was mistress better served for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed
2738,7113-86041-0096.flac,we skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again
2739,7113-86041-0067.flac,and then without fail you shall have your pets to play with almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without daining to answer him the gnome however
2740,7113-86041-0083.flac,which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory forever thereupon he caught up a great stone
2741,7113-86041-0081.flac,and bid him come with horses and men the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley the magpie listened hopped a while from branch to branch and then darted away
2742,7113-86041-0046.flac,it's not an appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden
2743,7113-86041-0095.flac,that shall be the test of your truth towards me unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task
2744,7113-86041-0011.flac,so he ran away and went to serve the judge here he upheld the law with might and maine and was a terror to thieves and evil doers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law
2745,7113-86041-0099.flac,which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself
2746,7113-86041-0027.flac,which certainly did look very inviting and they all went gaye to this new amusement the princess was ready for it but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down down down she sank
2747,7113-86041-0004.flac,to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills but the next time he ventured above ground what was his surprise to find everything changed the dark woods were hewed down
2748,7113-86041-0025.flac,but at length curiosity prevailed and she and her companions explored to their heart's content
2749,7113-86041-0050.flac,the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before
2750,7113-86041-0056.flac,and started back at the site of a group of shriveled crohn's with bent backs and trembling limbs who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth
2751,7113-86041-0106.flac,and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years but his fury was vain the thunderclouds melted away into a soft mist
2752,7113-86041-0102.flac,as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her but alas she was no longer there he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond
2753,7113-86041-0063.flac,to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found
2754,5390-24512-0042.flac,is the middle of all the words
2755,5390-24512-0007.flac,to crucify jesus of nazareth and to free barabas but in choosing the rebel barabas
2756,5390-24512-0022.flac,ah my countrymen he cried we did nothing without god in the past but now you are fighting against him had god judged you worthy of freedom he would have punished the romans as he did the assyrians long ago
2757,5390-24512-0049.flac,just so was it with the hebrew copies of god's word locked up in a dead language kept closed away from the world they were like the jar of wheat which could not grow
2758,5390-24512-0016.flac,and he sent a great army against jerusalem the jews shut the gates of their city and so began the awful siege of jerusalem and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies
2759,5390-24512-0032.flac,over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often and beside whose shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy a great and beautiful college it was with broad terrorist gardens
2760,5390-24512-0036.flac,before you copy a single word you must wash your body all over and clothe yourself in full jewish dress preparing your mind with solemn thoughts the parchment you write upon must be made from the skins of clean animals only
2761,5390-24512-0040.flac,that copy must be destroyed not satisfied with all these directions the master taught his scholar to count the letters of every book
2762,5390-24512-0019.flac,that mothers even snatch the bread from their own children's mouths look over the walls oh people of jerusalem the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide
2763,5390-24512-0000.flac,for all though the jewish family of the herods reigned over judea they only held their throne under the roman emperor this the jews could not endure they longed to be a free and independent nation once again
2764,5390-24512-0026.flac,and the golden candlestick and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen rome alas for the holy city over which the savior of the world had stood and wept 40 years before
2765,5390-24512-0027.flac,knowing the suffering that lay before her these jews are dangerous we must not allow them to rebuild their city or to become a separate people again as a nation they must cease to exist
2766,5390-24512-0020.flac,hard merciless as was the roman general even he grew sick with horror at last and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews promising them their lives if they would give up the city
2767,5390-24512-0014.flac,the romans believed them and opened their gates but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man as they died the roman soldiers whom not even death could terrify
2768,5390-24512-0024.flac,still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sun beams struck full on its golden roof then redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof
2769,5390-24512-0037.flac,that is clean according to the law of moses the ink you write with must be of a pure black made only from a mixture of soot charcoal and honey
2770,5390-24512-0017.flac,he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within
2771,5390-24512-0033.flac,so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible as we have seen the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god just as it stood they had begun even in our lord's day
2772,5390-24512-0031.flac,they allowed the jewish teachers to continue the synagogue services in other parts of palestine and to teach in their colleges the most famous jewish college of these days was at tiberias on the shores of the sea of galilee
2773,5390-24512-0038.flac,though you know the whole book of the law by heart you must not write a single word from memory but raise your eyes to your copy and pronounce the word aloud before trusting it to your pain
2774,5390-24512-0030.flac,the jews were now no longer a nation they had become merely a body of people led by their rabbis or teachers of the law but they were still the people of the book
2775,5390-24512-0045.flac,the breadth of each column had to be 30 letters wide there are 11 verses in the book of the law beginning and ending with n there are 40 verses in which low is read 3 times and so on and so on
2776,5390-24512-0041.flac,is the middle letter of all the 5 books of moses
2777,5390-24512-0013.flac,where the roman soldiers were quartered and cried out to the garrison within that their lives should be spared if they would lay down their weapons the roman soldiers hesitated but the jews promised most faithfully to keep their word
2778,5390-24512-0029.flac,exactly as the lord foretold there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers and is the property of the turkish nation
2779,5390-24512-0010.flac,yet the keener the suffering the more desperate the jews became their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge
2780,5390-24512-0006.flac,had not the jews prevented it if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend they cried
2781,5390-24512-0047.flac,nor for this purpose had god revealed his will to man some years ago in the coffin of an egyptian mummy a little jar of wheat was found for thousands of years it had lain there shut up in the dark
2782,5390-24512-0018.flac,as 1 by 1 their defenses fell and the end drew near then food failed in the city men fought like demons in the streets for a tiny loaf of barley bread so frantic were the people with hunger
2783,5390-24512-0035.flac,yet although the heated so little the true meaning of god's book they guarded its words more and more carefully and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict indeed my son an old teacher would say to his pupil
2784,5390-24512-0028.flac,so the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own they have indeed been led away captive into all nations
2785,5390-24512-0048.flac,while out in the fields the corn which had been sewn had grown up and been reaped every year and men and women had been fed but this jar of corn was useless because it had been prevented from doing the work in the world for which it was created
2786,5390-24512-0043.flac,is the very center of all the verses the letter a that is the hebrew letter which stands for a occurs 42377 times the letter b 35218
2787,5390-24512-0005.flac,the roman government had no quarrel with him thine own nation hath delivered thee unto me
2788,5390-24512-0009.flac,and the history of those years is 1 long list of terrible rising and massacres while cities were ruined villages wrapped in flames and men women and children perished with hunger
2789,5390-24512-0034.flac,that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud explanation the law of moses is like salt but the talmud is balmy spice they would say
2790,5390-24512-0002.flac,had jesus of nazareth been willing to become their earthly king and to lead the nation against the romans the jews would probably have followed him to a man
2791,5390-24512-0004.flac,showed them the right attitude in which to regard the roman rule
2792,5390-24512-0003.flac,the savior sought to heal it he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centurion and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesars
2793,5390-24512-0044.flac,and so on not only this but every scribe was required to know from memory exactly how many letters of each kind there should be in his sheet before he began to write every sheet of parchment must contain an equal number of lines
2794,5390-24512-0015.flac,lifted up their hands to heaven as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery
2795,5390-24512-0012.flac,yet no sooner did a daring rebel or murderer gather a band of robbers around him and begin to kill and plunder then multitudes of jews cried the christ or messiah has come
2796,5390-24512-0046.flac,how tedious and meaningless such information appears of what value were all these details to spend all his days in learning such things as these could have no influence on a man's character nor make him a powerful good in the world
2797,5390-24512-0021.flac,but a furious madness had possessed the people and they refused to yield josephus pleaded in vain he was not a christian but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people
2798,5390-24512-0039.flac,before writing any of the names of god you must wash your pain before writing his most sacred name you must wash your whole body if after your copy has itself been examined 3 corrections have to be made
2799,5390-24512-0008.flac,as their hero the nation started on their downward road as the story of the 40 years which followed the savior's crucifixion clearly shows for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke
2800,5390-24512-0011.flac,then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not matthew
2801,5390-24512-0001.flac,when our messiah comes he will be a great warrior they said he will utterly destroy all our enemies he will make jerusalem the greatest and richest city
2802,5390-24512-0023.flac,even a jew who had no faith in jesus christ could see plainly that the ancient power and glory of his nation had gone at last the end came the first wall fell
2803,5390-24512-0025.flac,pillars fel beams crumbled to ashes while round the altar of sacrifice the people of jerusalem lay heaped together slain in such numbers in the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream
2804,5390-30096-0027.flac,"have you investigated the farm at all i looked up a real estate dealer living at milville and rode him about the vague farm he said if anyone wanted the place very badly it might sell for $3,000"
2805,5390-30096-0007.flac,i just have to form a judgment and take me chances and when a poor devil goes wrong
2806,5390-30096-0033.flac,it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years
2807,5390-30096-0019.flac,and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that lent her face and indescribable charm everyone loved patsy doyle
2808,5390-30096-0014.flac,simple in his tastes modest and retiring lacking the education and refinements of polite society but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world the little man found his great enjoyment in the family circle
2809,5390-30096-0032.flac,you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no 1 would have as a gift uncle john looked sober again anyone live on the place major he inquired
2810,5390-30096-0001.flac,replied the major composedly it's a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you won't look after yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and ambitious young men who want to start in life oh uncle
2811,5390-30096-0024.flac,"if you would let him have 3,000 more so you took the farm and gave him the money i did so perhaps i am to blame"
2812,5390-30096-0016.flac,while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable he had never married
2813,5390-30096-0030.flac,beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farms the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and we'll all have a glorious lazy time
2814,5390-30096-0010.flac,with 1 thing and another what of it retorted the little round-faced millionaire leaning back in his chair and staring fixedly at the other that's what i implore you for now now gentlemen cried patsy earnestly
2815,5390-30096-0026.flac,he replied what became of the young man asked the girl he's a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile where is millville inquired uncle john thoughtfully somewhere at the north of the state i believe
2816,5390-30096-0011.flac,of his falling down and worshiping him john merrick was a multi-millionaire to be sure but there were ping circumstances that almost excused him he had been so busily occupied in industry
2817,5390-30096-0017.flac,patricia was the apple of uncle john's i and the 1 goddess enshrined in her doting father's heart glancing at her
2818,5390-30096-0008.flac,but some of them must succeed ventured psy in a consili tone some do said john merrick and that repays me for all my trouble
2819,5390-30096-0031.flac,and we can take mary along to do the cooking suggested py entering into the idea enthusiastically and eating our shirt sleeves said uncle john with a glowing face and have a cow and some pigs cried the girl
2820,5390-30096-0004.flac,and it's the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of i'm so glad cried py clapping her hands with a delighted gesture it's a splendid way to do good
2821,5390-30096-0028.flac,but his best information was to the effect that no 1 wanted it at all patsy laughed poor uncle john she said the little man however was serious
2822,5390-30096-0002.flac,do you do that exclaimed miss patricia doyle who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both so the major says answered uncle john dryly and it's true
2823,5390-30096-0000.flac,chapter 1 uncle john's farm how did i happen to own a farm asked uncle john interrupting his soup long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major doyle who sat opposite
2824,5390-30096-0012.flac,that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by accident then he promptly retired to give other fellows a chance and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity
2825,5390-30096-0029.flac,for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind years ago
2826,5390-30096-0021.flac,he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money quite right returned uncle john nodding but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale
2827,5390-30096-0013.flac,and the welfare and an entertainment of his 3 nieces he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of isom marvin and company
2828,5390-30096-0025.flac,"making 5,000 in all well it's gone john and you've got the farm the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wg and knocked out his patent i'm so sorry said patsy sympathetically"
2829,5390-30096-0003.flac,"asserted the other he's assisted 3 or 4 score young men to start in business in the last year to my certain knowledge by lending them some ranging from 1 to 3,000"

2832,5390-30096-0006.flac,and how can i tell whether they're deserving or not retorted major doyle fiercely do you want me to become a sleuth or engaged detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy
2833,5390-30096-0009.flac,query the major you mean all my trouble well and your money

2835,5390-30096-0018.flac,in her plain muslin gown a stranger would be tempted to wonder why she was red-haired freckled as a robin's egg pug-nosed and wide-mouthed but her blue eyes were beautiful
2836,5390-30096-0020.flac,and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face she was nearly 17 years old not very tall and her form to speak charitably
2837,5390-30096-0005.flac,without capital you know many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder and many will never get it there in any event declared the major with a shake of his grizzled head
2838,5390-30102-0018.flac,and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery and as instruments to the end there were several people available who could be of use to her mcnut the agent who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell old hux and his wife
2839,5390-30102-0013.flac,louise set to work to tabulate the information she had received thus far noting the element of mystery each fact evolved first captain wg must have been a rich man in order to build this house
2840,5390-30102-0020.flac,when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs louise said to him i've been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness that's true he replied
2841,5390-30102-0014.flac,secondly the captain are surely and silent man had brought hither perhaps by force a young woman as his wife who was so unhappy that she pined away and died who was this woman

2844,5390-30102-0002.flac,and men usually admired her graceful figure and her piquante pretty face with its crown of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression there was a rumor that she was engaged to be married to arthur welden
2845,5390-30102-0009.flac,the plain folks around milville might speculate listlessly upon the queer doings at the farm and never get anywhere near the truth indeed the strange occurrences she had just heard
2846,5390-30102-0011.flac,it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at milville and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detective
2847,5390-30102-0005.flac,louise merik was a clever girl possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of others her apparent shallow was a blind of the same character as her assumed graciousness
2848,5390-30102-0022.flac,when patsy and beth will be able to meet her that's a good idea louise i was wondering what i do this morning tell old hawks to get the nag harness the girl ran eagerly upon her errand
2849,5390-30102-0026.flac,dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle jon stood awaiting his niece

2852,5390-30102-0021.flac,can't we drive over to thompson's this morning uncle beth and psy have planned a tramp to the lake and a row after water lilies then let us make our call together we can invite the girl to come here and spend a day with us
2853,5390-30102-0003.flac,a young man of position in the city but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing 1 of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage when away from her frivolous mother
2854,5390-30102-0028.flac,or why someone don't knock him on the head dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane
2855,5390-30102-0015.flac,what had rendered her so unhappy and despairing thirdly the captain's only friend had been a crazy man named will thompson was he crazy before the captain's death or had he become crazed at that time
2856,5390-30102-0000.flac,chapter 7 louise sense a mystery louise merrick was the eldest of uncle john's nieces having just passed her 18th birthday
2857,5390-30102-0027.flac,i understand dan well i don't return uncle john in his whimsical way as he mounted to the seat beside her i don't understand how he's happened to live since the landing of columbus or what he's good for
2858,5390-30102-0007.flac,and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin uncle john thought he knew her too and was very proud of his eldest niece in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly admirable
2859,5390-30102-0030.flac,and at the summons old hawks came from the barn and approached them how do you get to miss thompson's place miss ethlas another fleeting expression of surprise yes we're going over to thank her for her kindness to us
2860,5390-30102-0004.flac,and the inconsequent home environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency 1 thing was indisputable however
2861,5390-30102-0016.flac,the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word why unless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible in the fifth place there was old hux and his blind wife to be considered
2862,5390-30102-0025.flac,don't jerk the bit for his mouth tender and it makes him bulky if he barks just let him rest a time and then speak to him danny fishes he's just ornery she climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins
2863,5390-30102-0017.flac,what did they know about their old masters secret history what tragic memories lurked beneath the man's perpetual smile and the woman's composed and sightless face surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity
2864,5390-30102-0019.flac,and ethel thompson the school teacher there might be others but 1 or another of these 4 must know the truth and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once
2865,5390-30102-0012.flac,an occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful won't however by the rebuff she had met with from uncle john the girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed investigation to anyone for the present
2866,5390-30102-0031.flac,thompson's stammered hugs glancing up at them with his bright elusive smile well we're going anyhow growled mr merrick
2867,5390-30102-0006.flac,and while she would have been more lovable without any pretense or sham she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was patsy and beth thought they knew her
2868,5390-30102-0008.flac,an extensive course of light literature not void of detective stories had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to send a mystery in the history of captain weg
2869,5390-30102-0010.flac,we're nearly forgotten in the community and soon would be forgotten altogether unless the quick ear of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored at first she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking
2870,1743-142912-0021.flac,turning away toward the green meadows instead peter didn't wait for scrapper to return
2871,1743-142912-0029.flac,cast off snake suits before peter could say another word cresty had flown away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old brier patch and then towards jenny renz house
2872,1743-142912-0033.flac,didn't i peter rabbit didn't i didn't i oh you certainly did jenny you certainly did and i'm sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing but i just didn't know who else to go to
2873,1743-142912-0005.flac,and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with red tail and then he saw
2874,1743-142912-0023.flac,every way but the right way look up over your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice
2875,1743-142912-0003.flac,at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices
2876,1743-142912-0030.flac,he just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny ran could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered liberty liberty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home
2877,1743-142912-0031.flac,jenny called peter jenny ran jenny ran no 1 answeredquestion
2878,1743-142912-0009.flac,all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him and attacking big red tail when he had succeeded in driving red tail far enough from the old orchard to suit him
2879,1743-142912-0014.flac,it reminded peter that he had often heard scrapper called the bee martin and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter
2880,1743-142912-0036.flac,he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors
2881,1743-142912-0034.flac,go to for what snap jenny ram what is it you've come to me for a snake skins replied peter snake skin snake skin streak jenny wren
2882,1743-142912-0027.flac,within your roaming about you run across an old cast off suit of mr black snake or any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said christie uh uh
2883,1743-142912-0019.flac,but if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrappers bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught the fly and it had tasted good
2884,1743-142912-0015.flac,there wouldn't be any honey if i did
2885,1743-142912-0013.flac,and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebbak did when he caught a fly but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrap or snapped it up
2886,1743-142912-0010.flac,scraper flew back and perched on a dead branch of 1 of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing
2887,1743-142912-0006.flac,a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at red tail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the ladder's coat
2888,1743-142912-0016.flac,those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that don't
2889,1743-142912-0024.flac,it was cresty the great crested fly catcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the king bird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender
2890,1743-142912-0020.flac,are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper i just then he spy blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him
2891,1743-142912-0004.flac,of course peter couldn't be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him
2892,1743-142912-0017.flac,i am 1 of farmer brown's best friends if he did but know it you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any 1 of them has better eyesight than i have i'd like to know who it is
2893,1743-142912-0035.flac,you don't understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to know is why should crusty the fly catcher asked me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family
2894,1743-142912-0018.flac,there's a fly weigh over there beyond the old apple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only 1/4 that distance away
2895,1743-142912-0028.flac,a a watch standard peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied crusty somewhat impatiently now don't forget peter i've got to go house hunting but you'll find me there or here abouts if it happens that you find 1 of those
2896,1743-142912-0032.flac,this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed didn't i tell you that i've got 7 eggs in here and then i can't spend any time gossiping
2897,1743-142912-0025.flac,his throat and breasts were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking
2898,1743-142912-0002.flac,the rest of us always feel safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now
2899,1743-142912-0001.flac,he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those 2 cousins of chipex did you say you're fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way that is what i said replied chebbak he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know
2900,1743-142912-0022.flac,just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard someone called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way
2901,1743-142912-0007.flac,he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him red tail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was
2902,1743-142912-0011.flac,peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the fly catchers there was just the tiniest of books on the end of his bill
2903,1743-142912-0012.flac,scrappers slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air
2904,1743-142912-0026.flac,you seem to be in a hurry so don't let me detain you peter said crusty before peter could find his tongue i just want to ask 1 little favor of you what is it asked peter who
2905,1743-142912-0000.flac,and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left behind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear
2906,1743-142912-0008.flac,he wasn't afraid and he intended that everybody should know it especially red tail it is because of his fearlessness that he has called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling red tail a robber and every other bad name he could think of
2907,1743-142914-0005.flac,he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled
2908,1743-142914-0000.flac,he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go
2909,1743-142914-0032.flac,they look so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but for mrs teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps mrs teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably
2910,1743-142914-0016.flac,for the first time peter knows that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes claim peter
2911,1743-142914-0015.flac,then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down long bill's throat where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole
2912,1743-142914-0020.flac,and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take a man asked peter long bill chuckled
2913,1743-142914-0023.flac,that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all its wonderful side peter i don't suppose anyone else can find hidden worms that way my cousin jack snipe can replied long bill promptly
2914,1743-142914-0001.flac,i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was 1 of the first birds to arrive and i've neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time
2915,1743-142914-0018.flac,peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunges bill into the ground and pulled out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface
2916,1743-142914-0017.flac,and was there a worm in everyone asked peter his eyes very wide with interest long bill nodded
2917,1743-142914-0034.flac,my exclaimed i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me he said he i'm so thankful i didn't i don't see how you dare to lay them in the open like this
2918,1743-142914-0021.flac,long bill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all that's the way i get them said he
2919,1743-142914-0010.flac,certainly i'll excuse your replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be that long bill was making such a good meal of but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground
2920,1743-142914-0025.flac,now i must be running along i'm ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get so peter said goodbye and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool
2921,1743-142914-0024.flac,he feeds the same way i do only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before
2922,1743-142914-0008.flac,i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger
2923,1743-142914-0003.flac,bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground was soft in places quite muddy peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly
2924,1743-142914-0031.flac,mrs teeter stood up and stepped aside then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for aligning 4 white eggs with big dark blotches on them
2925,1743-142914-0007.flac,i didn't mean to scare him apologized peter i really didn't mean to do you think he was really very much scared
2926,1743-142914-0012.flac,he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up
2927,1743-142914-0002.flac,off he started liberty liberty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows
2928,1743-142914-0006.flac,he scared me for a second then you're even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but long bill didn't peter turned quickly there was mrs woodcock peeping at him from behind a tusk of grass
2929,1743-142914-0026.flac,there was a little pebbly beach running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long slender bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waist coat neatly spotted with black
2930,1743-142914-0004.flac,from right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head
2931,1743-142914-0033.flac,it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it he wouldn't have known she was there
2932,1743-142914-0028.flac,it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peters peter greeted him joyously
2933,1743-142914-0022.flac,i think there is 1 right under my feet now watch me get him long belt board into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained long bill it is only in soft ground that i can do this
2934,1743-142914-0014.flac,his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly long bill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length
2935,1743-142914-0030.flac,just then mrs teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start
2936,1743-142914-0019.flac,well these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for anyone to know that they were there
2937,1743-142914-0029.flac,before peter could say another word peter came running towards him and it was plain to see that peter was very anxious about something don't move peter rabbit don't move he cried why not demanded peter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move
2938,1743-142914-0009.flac,i'm glad it is no 1 but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it you'll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites
2939,1743-142914-0027.flac,every few steps he would stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down and the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw
2940,1743-142914-0013.flac,his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while his breasts and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it was his head that made him look queer
2941,1743-142914-0011.flac,long bill took 2 or 3 steps in rather a stately fashion peter had to hide a smile for long bill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd-looking fellow
2942,1743-142913-0025.flac,tommy tit the chickeny sometimes uses an old house then again he and mrs chickity get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new 1
2943,1743-142913-0023.flac,win some bluebirds stupid snapped jenny ran peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and skimmer the tree swallow out of jenny that's so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter
2944,1743-142913-0015.flac,then as peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply christy and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest said she why they wanted goodness knows but
2945,1743-142913-0019.flac,where are your eyes peter did you ever see a fly catcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didn't wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look
2946,1743-142913-0024.flac,i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny ran nodded yanked the nuthatch uses an old house i'm told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she
2947,1743-142913-0029.flac,jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well what is it now she demanded have you got 2 holmes asked peter good gracious no exclaimed jenny
2948,1743-142913-0009.flac,it is so quiet and restful that i love it mrs peewee and i are very retiring we do not like too many near neighbors you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while will you ask peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch
2949,1743-142913-0003.flac,it didn't take peter long to find a peewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw peewee fly out and make the same kind of little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies
2950,1743-142913-0005.flac,but he wasn't sad as peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger than his cousin chebek but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail
2951,1743-142913-0004.flac,it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone peewee peewee peewee
2952,1743-142913-0022.flac,the older it is the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us
2953,1743-142913-0011.flac,that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly loved to destroy
2954,1743-142913-0001.flac,he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying peewee peewee peewee peter chuckled happily
2955,1743-142913-0017.flac,and they certainly have good sense in a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugg by the way where does crusty build asked peter
2956,1743-142913-0026.flac,then there are key the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl peter looked surprised i didn't suppose they nested in holes in trees he exclaimed they certainly do more as the pity snapped jenny
2957,1743-142913-0014.flac,jenny ran was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way and that way and that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded
2958,1743-142913-0010.flac,come as often as you like replied peewee the often or the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the fly catcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him
2959,1743-142913-0018.flac,in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite a surprise to see felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny wren
2960,1743-142913-0021.flac,i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesn't attract attention the way a new 1 does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in
2961,1743-142913-0008.flac,that is something i don't often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call you would peewee peewee chuckled happily
2962,1743-142913-0020.flac,there is downey the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute that's good i like to see that it means that next year there will be 1 more house for someone here in the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses
2963,1743-142913-0006.flac,the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing 2 whitish bars and he noticed that peewees wings were longer than his tail which wasn't the case with chebek
2964,1743-142913-0000.flac,with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old bryer patch on his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard
2965,1743-142913-0007.flac,but no 1 could ever mistake peewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over aren't you here early asked peter peewee nodded
2966,1743-142913-0012.flac,but most of all peter thought about that queer request of christy's in a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast-off coat of mr black snake
2967,1743-142913-0016.flac,perhaps they think it will scare robbers away as for me i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that crusty and his wife are a handsome couple
2968,1743-142913-0028.flac,spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine i've talked quite enough for 1 morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him
2969,1743-142913-0013.flac,it was such a funny thing for crusty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mr son had kicked his bed clothes off
2970,1743-142913-0030.flac,1 is all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mr ren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree it seems to me that he has carried enough in there to build 2 or 3 nests
2971,1743-142913-0027.flac,it would be a good thing for the rest of us that they didn't nest at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them kelly always uses 1 that is high up and comes back to it year after year
2972,1743-142913-0002.flac,he usually is 1 of the last of the fly catcher family to arrive i didn't expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early
2973,8238-274553-0060.flac,upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i still find great difficulty owing to the refined peculiar nature of our disagreement
2974,8238-274553-0061.flac,i have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters pertaining to the rules of etiquette
2975,8238-274553-0069.flac,he now explained the mystery
2976,8238-274553-0066.flac,to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron
2977,8238-274553-0073.flac,and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit upon this hint he proceeded
2978,8238-274553-0070.flac,and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately
2979,8238-274553-0071.flac,where there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practiced in modern times the barren afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in herman's way
2980,8238-274553-0068.flac,he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning he then took the book himself and read me a chapter allowed to my surprise
2981,8238-274553-0058.flac,will hand you this note i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience and explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers in the event of your declining this request
2982,8238-274553-0057.flac,although not 1 syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling
2983,8238-274553-0074.flac,herman would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duelo
2984,8238-274553-0056.flac,per construction m
2985,8238-274553-0055.flac,from this he read me 1 of the dishes in the world
2986,8238-274553-0067.flac,he seemed to receive herman's amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duali lex scripta aetna
2987,8238-274553-0063.flac,to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation with sentiments of profound respect your most obedient servant van young
2988,8238-274553-0072.flac,2 or 3 weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation
2989,8238-274553-0065.flac,8 per se having finished reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself
2990,8238-274553-0064.flac,herman commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self complacency
2991,8238-274553-0062.flac,the nicetie of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient i am assured
2992,8238-274553-0059.flac,having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which i carried to hermann sir through our common friend mr p i have received your note of this evening
2993,8238-274553-0023.flac,lay like an incubus upon the university
2994,8238-274553-0007.flac,that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the barren ritner van young then of no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guest respecting his age by any data personally awarded
2995,8238-274553-0014.flac,ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practical the old bulldog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused the ghost of heraclitus or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology
2996,8238-274553-0040.flac,for a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched
2997,8238-274553-0021.flac,my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household
2998,8238-274553-0002.flac,through a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental confirmation in later days this insight grew more clear
2999,8238-274553-0012.flac,the study in the business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue
3000,8238-274553-0031.flac,but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the dwayyo and the nicetie of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he rode to the death to ritner
3001,8238-274553-0041.flac,the language you have thought proper to employ
3002,8238-274553-0019.flac,the address too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created
3003,8238-274553-0042.flac,in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman
3004,8238-274553-0030.flac,and i believe for some logical talent as a duelist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly
3005,8238-274553-0049.flac,and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly forebear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profoundest gravity what he termed the refined peculiar character
3006,8238-274553-0037.flac,then excessively red then dropping his pocket handkerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no 1 else at the table
3007,8238-274553-0018.flac,which upon each such failure of his praiseworthy endeavors would suse every linear of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions
3008,8238-274553-0050.flac,after a tiresome hering in his ordinary style he took down from his bookshelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the dwayyo and entertained me for a long time
3009,8238-274553-0017.flac,in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater
3010,8238-274553-0051.flac,the theater of honor by favn
3011,8238-274553-0033.flac,i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r and giving his reasons in detail
3012,8238-274553-0047.flac,striking the reflection of this person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and ritner took their departure
3013,8238-274553-0022.flac,with the memory of the barren ritz nirvan young
3014,8238-274553-0048.flac,as herman went out the barren whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business
3015,8238-274553-0013.flac,i quaintly termed the domination of the barren ritz nirvan young ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character i think that no person at the university with the exception of myself
3016,8238-274553-0024.flac,during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening
3017,8238-274553-0010.flac,after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features can bang so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity
3018,8238-274553-0034.flac,to these the baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer
3019,8238-274553-0045.flac,this being done there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yandere and thus fulfill all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult
3020,8238-274553-0032.flac,ever upon the lookout for the grotesque his peculiarities head for a long time passed afforded food for mystification of this however i was not aware
3021,8238-274553-0039.flac,for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadaverous
3022,8238-274553-0046.flac,while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite herman
3023,8238-274553-0006.flac,manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable
3024,8238-274553-0038.flac,it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i had never seen it assumed except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood erect
3025,8238-274553-0036.flac,i would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman as herman completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were turned upon the barren
3026,8238-274553-0027.flac,a ridiculous of those very points for which he contended and especially to hold the entire fan ferren of dueling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves
3027,8238-274553-0011.flac,solemnity and repose it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said that the baron was 1 of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification
3028,8238-274553-0053.flac,with a fine margin and bound by jerome
3029,8238-274553-0044.flac,you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shalt make upon your imagination and endeavor to consider for an instant
3030,8238-274553-0026.flac,an impressiveness and an affection of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even myself well knew him to be at heart
3031,8238-274553-0028.flac,looking around me during a pause in the baron's discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of coal ridge
3032,8238-274553-0004.flac,no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted
3033,8238-274553-0035.flac,your opinions allow me to say baron van young although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member
3034,8238-274553-0009.flac,he was by no means a handsome man perhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub
3035,8238-274553-0003.flac,which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the 25th of june i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world
3036,8238-274553-0008.flac,he might have been 15 or 50
3037,8238-274553-0029.flac,except perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great full he contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking
3038,8238-274553-0000.flac,i'll have none of them ned nulls the baron ritner van young was a noble hungarian family every member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend
3039,8238-274553-0054.flac,and having the quaint title duali lex scripta at nan
3040,8238-274553-0015.flac,this too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsical and buffoon were brought about if not directly by him
3041,8238-274553-0052.flac,brand terms memoirs of duels published at cologne 1666
3042,8238-274553-0020.flac,from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual mystic escape
3043,8238-274553-0001.flac,was more or less remarkable for talent of some description the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which teik a sign of the house has given a vivid
3044,8238-274553-0005.flac,but letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits
3045,8238-274553-0016.flac,lay in that consumate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self-possession
3046,8238-274553-0025.flac,and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardour and eloquence
3047,8238-274553-0043.flac,is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but 1 line of conduct
3048,8238-283452-0034.flac,but the spook that provides a joke on his host or on himself is a yankee in origin and development the dry humor the comic sense of the incongruous the willingness to laugh at himself as at others
3049,8238-283452-0017.flac,many americans there are today who would court being haunted by the captain and crew of richard middleton's ghost ship that landed in a turnip field and dispensed drink till they demoralized the dennis of village and graveyard alike
3050,8238-283452-0040.flac,till the phantom couple take a liking to each other and decide to let the living bury their dead this is suggestive of brand or matthews earlier and cleverer story of a spectral core chip in the rival ghosts
3051,8238-283452-0022.flac,the modern humorous ghost satirizes everything from the old-fashioned spectre he's very fond of taking pot shots at him to the latest psychic manifestations
3052,8238-283452-0015.flac,he knows that there's no weapon no threat in horror to be compared with ridicule think what a solemn creature the gothic ghost was
3053,8238-283452-0047.flac,the field is still comparatively limited but a number of americans have done distinctive work in it the spectre now wears mly instead of a shroud
3054,8238-283452-0027.flac,where the suitor on the moonlet porch attempting to tell his fair 1 that he dotes on her sees the ghost of her ferocious uncle who isn't dead
3055,8238-283452-0038.flac,of the early specimens of the really amusing ghost that is an actual revenue is the ghost baby in blackwoods which shows originality and humor yet is too diffuse for printing here
3056,8238-283452-0026.flac,and demonstrate a new kind of apparition the ghost story of today gives you spinal sensations with a difference as in the immortal transferred ghost by fred r stockton
3057,8238-283452-0039.flac,in that we have a conventional young bachelor engaged to a charming girl who is entangled in social complications and made to suffer mental torment because without his consent
3058,8238-283452-0032.flac,and compromised on a few stately ejaculations as being safely phantasmal speaking parts but compare that usage with the rude freedom of some modern spooks
3059,8238-283452-0041.flac,medieval and later literature give us many instances of love affair or marriage between 1 spirit and 1 mortal
3060,8238-283452-0035.flac,and are preserved in their true flavor i don't assert of course
3061,8238-283452-0029.flac,has never been a ghost nor used a wooden leg but a terrifying leg a sea while you do believe in it the new ghost has a more nimble and versatile tongue as well as witt
3062,8238-283452-0024.flac,and uses the old thrills only to show what dead batteries they come from his really electrical effects are his own inventions he needs no dungeon keeps and monkish cells to play about in not he
3063,8238-283452-0028.flac,kicking his heels against the railing and here's his admonition that he'd better hurry up as the live uncle is coming in sight
3064,8238-283452-0031.flac,and ghosts like kings and drama were of a dignity and must preserve it in their speech or perhaps the authors were doubtful as to the dialogue of shades
3065,8238-283452-0020.flac,a ghost moreover that towered and swelled at every hack needed phrase till finally he filled the room and burst after the young man proposed to his admired 1 and made subsequent remarks
3066,8238-283452-0023.flac,he laughs at ghosts that aren't experts in efficiency haunting and he has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of specters he loves to shake the lugubrious terrors of the past before you
3067,8238-283452-0042.flac,show the diversity of the english humor as associated with apparitions and are entertaining in themselves the canterville ghost by oscar wilde is 1 of his best short stories
3068,8238-283452-0046.flac,we feel downright neighborly toward such specters as the futile last ghost nelson lloyd evokes for us as we appreciate the satire of ros o'neal's sophisticated wraith
3069,8238-283452-0045.flac,john kendrick bangs has made the darker region seemed comfortable and homelike for us and has created ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward to being 1 or more
3070,8238-283452-0037.flac,there are various english stories of whimsical haunting some of actual spooks and some of the hoax type hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in british as in american literature
3071,8238-283452-0021.flac,ghost not only have appallingly long memories but they possess a mean advantage over the living in that they have once been mortal
3072,8238-283452-0033.flac,think of having always and always to speak a dead language the humerus ghost is not only modern but he is distinctively american there are ghosts of all nationalities naturally
3073,8238-283452-0043.flac,this travesty on the conventional traditions of the wraith is preposterously delightful 1 of the cleverest ghost stories in our language zhang well has written engagingly of spooks
3074,8238-283452-0036.flac,the french and english selections in this volume are sufficient to prove the contrary
3075,8238-283452-0044.flac,frank our stockton gave his to funny spooks with a riotous and laughing pain the spirit in the transferred ghost is impudently deathless and has called up a train of subsequent hunters
3076,8238-283452-0016.flac,how little originality and initiative he showed and how dependent he was on his own atmosphere for thrills his sole appeal was to the spinal column the ghost of today touches the funny bone as well

3080,8238-283452-0030.flac,in the older fiction and drama apparitions spoke seldom
3081,8238-283452-0018.flac,after that show of spirits the turnips in that field tasted of rum long after the ghost ship had sailed away into the blue the modern spook is possessed not only of humor but of a caustic satire as well
3082,8238-283452-0009.flac,and indulging in greater freedom a ghost can call his shade his own now and exhibit any mood he pleases even young female wraiths demanding latch keys refused to obey the frowning face of the clock
3083,8238-283452-0011.flac,manifestly death has compensations not connected with the consolations of religion the marvel is that apparitions were so long in realizing their possibilities in improving their advantages
3084,8238-283452-0010.flac,to make the ghost of mrs grundy turn a shade paler and horror nowadays haunters have more fun and freedom than the haunted in fact it's money in 1 pocket these days to be dead for ghosts have no rent problems

3086,8238-283452-0013.flac,at best a revenue could only rattle a rusty skeleton or shake a moldy shroud or clank a chain but as mortals cowered before his demonstrations he didn't work
3087,8238-283452-0006.flac,the number of ghosts children of any or all types is small proportionately perhaps because it seems an unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances
3088,8238-283452-0004.flac,while the feminine can be seen through by another woman and thus disarmed the majority of the comic apparitions curiously enough are masculine you don't often find women raised in smiles
3089,8238-283452-0007.flac,there are a few instances as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later but very few ancient ghosts were a long-faced lot
3090,8238-283452-0005.flac,and have chivalry spared the gentler shades and there are very few funny child ghosts you might almost say none in comparison with the number of grown-ups
3091,8238-283452-0012.flac,the specters in classic and medieval literature were malarial vaporous beings without energy to do anything but threatened
3092,8238-283452-0008.flac,since any living person however senile would be thought juvenile compared with a timeless spook but in these days of individualism and radical liberalism spooks as well as mortals are expanding their personalities
3093,8238-283452-0002.flac,his spine gave notice of what etiquette demanded in the event of outdoor apparition if a man failed to bear his head in awe the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness
3094,8238-283452-0000.flac,introduction the humerus ghost is distinctly a modern character in early literature wraiths took themselves very seriously
3095,8238-283452-0003.flac,in that her locks being long and pinned up are less easily moved which may explain the fact if it be a fact that in fiction women have shown themselves more self-possessed
3096,5456-62014-0011.flac,i reckon he gets so tired hunting all day no wonder he had a blink his eyes to keep him open but a man he won't satisfy it
3097,5456-62014-0012.flac,here the old woman rose and threw on a handful of lightwood which blazed up with a great sputtering and in the strong light she stood before the fire and acting the part of the scared owl for the delighted yet half startled children

3114,5456-62014-0014.flac,and the women stayed at out a tub of screech cuz they see nothing but a big ass sitting dog blinking
3115,5456-24741-0008.flac,corollary the mind is able to regard as present external bodies by which the human body has once been affected even though they be no longer in existence or present
3116,5456-24741-0005.flac,it will have the idea of the mode is actually existing
3117,5456-24741-0001.flac,proof all the modes in which any given body is affected
3118,5456-24741-0018.flac,whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes
3119,5456-24741-0014.flac,which associations arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications affections of the human body i say first it is an association of those ideas only
3120,5456-24741-0000.flac,the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies
3121,5456-24741-0023.flac,the human body itself and is actually existing therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body
3122,5456-24741-0015.flac,ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking
3123,5456-24741-0017.flac,in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas
3124,5456-24741-0007.flac,well regard the external body is actually existing
3125,5456-24741-0016.flac,those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies i say secondly
3126,5456-24741-0012.flac,the modifications of the human body of which the idea is represent an external bodies is present to us we will call the images of things though they do not recall the figure of things when the mind regards bodies in this fashion we say that it imagines
3127,5456-24741-0020.flac,a roman would straight away arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it
3128,5456-24741-0013.flac,looked at in themselves did not contain error the mind does not err in the mere act of imagining but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea
3129,5456-24741-0003.flac,therefore the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body
3130,5456-24741-0009.flac,by which the human body has once been affected be no longer in existence the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated
3131,5456-24741-0006.flac,in other words it will have the idea which does not exclude but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body
3132,5456-24741-0011.flac,the latter indicates rather the disposition of paul's body than the nature of peter and therefore while this disposition of paul's body lasts paul's mind will regard peter as present to itself even though he no longer exists further to retain the usual phraseology
3133,5456-24741-0022.flac,or the human mind perceives those modifications
3134,5456-24741-0021.flac,that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit
3135,5456-24741-0010.flac,note we thus see how it comes about
3136,5456-24741-0002.flac,wherefore their idea also necessarily
3137,5456-24741-0024.flac,following in god in the same manner and being referred to god in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the human body proof
3138,5456-24741-0019.flac,and hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of 1 thing should straight away arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum and apple
3139,5456-24741-0004.flac,hence it follows first that the human mind perceives the nature of a variety of bodies together with the nature of its own
3140,5456-62043-0025.flac,i heard the bell and the pilots hail what's your price for wood a youthful voice on the shore answered 3 and a quarter damn it ejaculated the captain
3141,5456-62043-0016.flac,thompson i say we'd better take 3 or 4 chords at the next woodard it can't be more than 6 miles from here 2 aces in a bragger with the age
3142,5456-62043-0023.flac,they wanted to learn the game at 2:00 the captain asked the mate how we were getting on oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising
3143,5456-62043-0027.flac,was the reply of the youthful salesman the captain here told thompson to take 6 cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game the pilots here changed places when did they sleep would taken in
3144,5456-62043-0019.flac,3 and a quarter but soon again became interested in the game from my upper berth there were no staterooms then i could observe the movements of the players
3145,5456-62043-0020.flac,the latter personages took it turned and turned about steering and plain bragg 1 of them almost invariably winning while the 2 passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their aunties they were anxious to learn the game
3146,5456-62043-0004.flac,and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of natchez on the next day our wood was getting low and night coming on the pilot on duty above the other pilot held 3 aces at the time and was just calling out the captain who went it strong on 3 kings
3147,5456-62043-0013.flac,in about half an hour we felt the caravan commenced paddling again supper was over
3148,5456-62043-0033.flac,and the captain hailed hello the wood-yard hello yourself answered a squeaking female voice which came from a woman with a petticoat over her shoulders in place of a shawl what's the price of wood
3149,5456-62043-0001.flac,she was regularly advertised as the fast running etc her regular trips from new orleans to natchez were usually made from 6 to 8 days a trip made by her in 5 days was considered remarkable
3150,5456-62043-0018.flac,i can't very well leave the game now it's getting right warm just pilots beating us all to smash the wooden completed we paddled on again the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodard
3151,5456-62043-0014.flac,situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate
3152,5456-62043-0010.flac,what's the odd quarter for i should like to know you only charge me 3 as i went down why cap tang drawed out the wood merchant with a sort of a lear on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold
3153,5456-62043-0024.flac,this would seems rather better than that we took in a yellow faces but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask him what's the price of wood up here i've got you again
3154,5456-62043-0037.flac,accompanied by the same leader of the same yellow countenance why darn it all captaining there is but 3 or 4 chords left and since it's you i don't care if i do let you have it for 3 as you're a good customer
3155,5456-62043-0031.flac,the pilot with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game and said in an undertone 40 a piece for you and i and james the other pilot is not bad for 1 night i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs
3156,5456-62043-0021.flac,and they did learn it once in a while indeed seeing they had 2 aces and a bragger they would venture a bit of 5 or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot
3157,5456-62043-0038.flac,and turned in to take some rest the fact became apparent the reader will probably have discovered it sometime since
3158,5456-62043-0036.flac,without crept from the cottage the veritable faded hat copper is colored pants yellow countenance and 2 weeks beard we had seen the night before
3159,5456-62043-0008.flac,with a 2 weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of coppers colored lindsay woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee she's without stockings a faded broad-brimmed hat which had once been black
3160,5456-62043-0032.flac,there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taken in more than 60 yards so i was disappointed in my expectation we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for would the banks being invisible from the middle of the river there it is exclaimed the captain stop her
3161,5456-62043-0026.flac,the stranger suffering some at the same time 3 and a quarter again are we never to get to a cheaper country deal sir if you please better luck next time the other pilot's voice was again heard on deck how much have you only about 10 chords sir
3162,5456-62043-0034.flac,i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petticoat
3163,5456-62043-0017.flac,the game went on and the paddles kept moving at 11:00 it was reported to the captain that we were nearing the wood-yard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty header and shore then and taking 6 cords of its good seed to a thompson
3164,5456-62043-0030.flac,it appears the 2 passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost $120 the captain as he rose to see about taking in some good wood which he felt sure of obtaining now that he had got above the level country winked at his opponent
3165,5456-62043-0028.flac,the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length donned the brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation
3166,5456-62043-0006.flac,which he said was situated right around yonder point but muttered the captain i don't much like to take wood of the yellow-faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than anyone else however there's no other chance
3167,5456-62043-0029.flac,the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning
3168,5456-62043-0002.flac,avoids from new orleans to vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the falls louisville i have never learned if she did
3169,5456-62043-0003.flac,she must have had a time of it it was my fate to take passage in this boat the captain was a good-natured easy-going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of bragg we had been out a little more than 5 days
3170,5456-62043-0015.flac,how does that would burn inquired the captain of the mate who was looking on at the game it isn't a munch account i reckon answered the mate it's cottonwood and most of its green at that well thompson 3 aces again stranger
3171,5456-62043-0009.flac,and a pipe in his mouth casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening our spring line answered why captain we must charge you 3 and a quarter this time the devil replied the captain
3172,5456-62043-0000.flac,a bully boat and a brag captain a story of steamboat life on the mississippi by saul smith does anyone remember the caravan she was what would now be considered a slowboat then 1827
3173,5456-62043-0007.flac,and then a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good-sized wood pile hello colonel how do you sell your wood this time a yellow-faced old gentleman
3174,5456-62043-0012.flac,and there's no other wood yard for 9 miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fuel why well well interrupted to the captain will take a few chords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of bragg
3175,5456-62043-0035.flac,and now you know it 3 in the devil broke in the captain what have you raised on your wood too i'll give you 3 and not a scent more well replied the petticoat here comes the old man he'll talk to you and sure enough
3176,5456-62043-0005.flac,sent down word that the maid had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the 2 passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck

3266,1088-134315-0036.flac,and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fischer hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
3267,1088-134318-0006.flac,head tx returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened tx with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied tx and delayed his suspicions
3268,1088-134318-0002.flac,to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
3269,1088-134318-0003.flac,to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
3270,1088-134318-0008.flac,yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps cara hesitated perhaps you would better wait until 11:00
3271,1088-134318-0009.flac,and bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or a better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tessellated hallway
3272,1088-134318-0014.flac,he pushed open the door and announced mr gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
3273,1088-134318-0013.flac,then lead on fischer showed the way up the stairs this time the traveler carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fischer privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact

3275,1088-134318-0020.flac,at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mr charis put down his steel latch said fischer with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
3276,1088-134318-0010.flac,muttering to himself and staring at the very objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mr carol will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
3277,1088-134318-0004.flac,he remembered the day well because it was candlemist day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant

3280,1088-134318-0001.flac,it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasants cabin on the hillside outside dazzo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kera's whim all that life held for a man
3281,1088-134318-0015.flac,fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below 10 minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fischer went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
3282,1088-134318-0007.flac,cara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you are in bed sir and he used shocking language said fischer cara laughed send him up he said
3283,1088-134318-0018.flac,damn all greeks he said joely and fischer could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveler touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
3284,1088-134318-0017.flac,and fischer standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitors so genial i suppose your check will be honored all right asked the visitors sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
3285,1088-134318-0021.flac,until 11 oclock at any rate he is a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
3286,1088-134318-0011.flac,yes sir said fischer look here the man thrust out his face do you see those gray hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it gray challenged the visitor with a roar
3287,1088-134318-0019.flac,always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fischer but i think you will always find that mr cara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you

3293,1088-129236-0028.flac,the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion who cannot write well under any other circumstances
3294,1088-129236-0025.flac,the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes

3300,1088-129236-0008.flac,only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aid we may attain that inward view of the law which i'll describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden
3301,1088-129236-0017.flac,yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience

3305,1088-129236-0012.flac,the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment
3306,1088-129236-0010.flac,which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions in bitter and mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name

3312,1088-129236-0020.flac,the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of 1 voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstances associated with 1 form is put in the amber of memory
3313,1088-129236-0024.flac,all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keene recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with a generous deed it resolved on
3314,1088-129236-0006.flac,for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no 1 who is truly its servant to grow old
3315,1088-129236-0005.flac,and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable sensors i shall appeal to my seniors
3316,1088-129236-0022.flac,the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enameled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone wherever thou art

3322,3240-131232-0034.flac,again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes
3323,3240-131232-0037.flac,so just to me something of a migratory nature but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january if ever as to falls or flutings of winged insects from the sky prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough

3530,8098-275181-0009.flac,no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact it was clear that something must be done and at once too
3531,8098-275181-0030.flac,these numerous bites however were followed by no serious ill effects the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass that he had caught hold of 1 of its hind legs
3532,8098-275181-0013.flac,each a wider fine dry grass as large as the court box these were gathered up and filled the great basket there said he triumphantly don't them smell mousy they did certainly
3533,8098-275181-0019.flac,as i had heard it said that foxes did when mousing instantly 2 spry brown hands from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip as a fox i struggled tremendously
3534,8098-275181-0003.flac,and by day they wandered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beech nuts which were very plentiful that fall all went well till the last week in october went on taking the census 1 morning a turkey was found to be missing
3535,8098-275181-0020.flac,then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone do you see now he demanded i saw but a fox would bite you i objected let him bite said tom
3536,8098-275181-0021.flac,with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stone heaps were and where he had often is heard fox's bark selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry breyers which grew about a great pine stump
3537,8098-275181-0026.flac,as i ran 2 or 3 dull wax came to my ear got him tom i shouted rushing up tom was holding and squeezing 1 of his hands with the other and shaking it violently
3538,8098-275181-0017.flac,and with it completely covered himself the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest or rather a small hock
3539,8098-275181-0014.flac,they savored as strongly of mice as tom's question of bad grammar and no foxes catch mice demanded tom confidently yes but i don't see how that's going to catch a fox i said
3540,8098-275181-0018.flac,inside the nest evidently there were mice in it and feeling my character as fox at stake i at once trotted forward then crept up and as the rustling and squeaking continued made a pounce into the grass
3541,8098-275181-0001.flac,to call the real mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps this indeed is a favorite trick of renard at the time of my story my friend tom edwards 10 years of age

3543,8098-275181-0011.flac,it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch that fox during the next 2 weeks i recollect that we said 3 traps for him to no purpose
3544,8098-275181-0023.flac,made by sucking the air sharply between his teeth now be off said tom and don't come poking around nor get in sight till you hear me holler
3545,8098-275181-0015.flac,well look here then i'll show you said he
3546,8098-275181-0005.flac,tom thought it was the twombly boys nefarious sam in particular i thought it might have been an owl but under the tree in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug we found fox tracks
3547,8098-275181-0008.flac,this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only 29 the next morning there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter
3548,8098-275181-0006.flac,and 2 or 3 ominous little wads of feathers with 1 long tail feather a drift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butternut had a fit perhaps
3549,8098-275181-0000.flac,they're sharp curl like barks used often to rouses and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields mousing around the stone heaps making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse
3550,8098-275181-0004.flac,the third 1 had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening it was the first 1 we had lost we proceeded to look for traces our suspicions were divided
3551,8098-275181-0007.flac,and a casualty such as turkey razors are unavoidably heirs to and we wore our laws with resignation we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roosts
3552,8098-275181-0024.flac,in being amidst nice cozy straw i presently went to sleep quite unintentionally i must have slept sometime though it seemed to me but a very few minutes what woke me was a noise a sharp suppress yelp
3553,8098-275181-0032.flac,i do not think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again however we sold the fox skin in the village and received 13 dollars for it whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than 3 dollars
3554,8098-275181-0027.flac,he said not a word but left me to poke about and stumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near viky i exclaimed after satisfying myself that the fox was dead some said tom
3555,8098-275181-0012.flac,had succeeded in getting 2 more of the turkeys heroes it is said are born of great crises this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius i'll have that fox he said when the traps failed
3556,8098-275181-0028.flac,and that was all i could get from him that night we took the fox to the house and later the candle it was the silver gray tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed
3557,8098-275181-0025.flac,it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field
3558,8098-275181-0022.flac,tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contents of the big basket he then practiced squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim his squeaks were perfect successes
3559,8098-275181-0031.flac,i just determined to have it out with him considering the fact that a fox is a very active sharp biting animal and that this was an unusually large male i have always thought tom got off very well
3560,8098-275181-0033.flac,hair or by wet wiles at fox got the turkeys out of the high butternut is a secret
3561,8098-275181-0002.flac,and myself were in the turkey business equal partners we owned a flock of 31 turkeys these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house in the very top of it
3562,8098-275181-0029.flac,his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow several minor nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab
