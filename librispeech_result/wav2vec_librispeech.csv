0,441-128982-0000.flac,when the little fleet of spanish vessels including the one which had been captured by bartholemy portugues and his men were on their way to campeachy they met with very stormy weather so that they were separated and the ship which contained bartholemy and his companions arrived first at the port for which they were bound
1,441-128982-0002.flac,for as they were all very able bodied men they would be extremely useful on a ship but when his vessel was safely moored and it became known in the town that he had a company of pirates on board
2,441-128982-0007.flac,but he did not lose heart and immediately set to work to free himself from his irons which were probably very clumsy affairs at last caring little how much he scratched and tore his skin
3,441-128982-0004.flac,and who ought immediately to be delivered up to the civil authorities this proposal however met with no favor from the spanish captain who had found bartholemy a very quiet man and could see that he was a very strong one
4,441-128982-0027.flac,and he had no wine jars now with which to boy himself up
5,441-128982-0031.flac,and who began to rub a crow bar on a stone in order to reduce it to the proper size bartholemy carefully knocked all the nails out of the board and then finding a large flat stone he rubbed down one of them until he had formed it into the shape of a rude knife blade
6,441-128982-0034.flac,gathering up his legs so as to keep out of reach of the alligators and with a long pole pushed himself off from shore sometimes paddling and sometimes pushing his pole against the bottom he at last got across the river and took up his journey upon dry land
7,441-128982-0001.flac,the captain who had bartholemy and the others in charge did not know what an important capture he had made he supposed that these pirates were ordinary buccaneers and it appears that it was his intention to keep them as his own private prisoners
8,441-128982-0006.flac,when this dignitary heard the story he immediately sent a party of officers to the ship and commanded the captain to deliver the pirate leader into their charge the other men were left where they were
9,441-128982-0012.flac,this came soon after nightfall a man descended with a lantern to see that the prisoner was still secure let us hope that it was not the soldier who had kindly informed him of his fate and as soon as he was fairly in the hold bartholemus sprang upon him
10,441-128982-0010.flac,and he did not know how to swim which seems a strange failing in a hardy sailor with so many other nautical accomplishments in the rough hold where he was shut up our pirate peering about anxious and earnest
11,441-128982-0017.flac,which was what he wished to do if the hound should get upon his trail he was a lost man the desperate pirate therefore determined to give the bloodhounds no chance to follow him and for three days he remained in a marshy forest in the dark recesses of which he could hide
12,441-128982-0021.flac,and this sight doubtless animated him very much during the first part of his journey the terrible trials and hardships which bartholemy experienced during his tramp along the coast were such as could have been endured only by one of the strongest and toughest of men
13,441-128982-0014.flac,for a moment he sank below the surface but the two air tight jars quickly rose and bore him up with them there was a bustle on board the ship there was some random firing of muskets in the direction of the splashing which the watch had heard
14,441-128982-0025.flac,the animals might howl around him and glare at him with their shining eyes and the alligators might lash the water into foam with their great tails
15,441-128982-0019.flac,and sometimes he saw at night distant torches which he wase sure were carried by men who were hunting for him but at last the pursuit seemed to be given up and hearing no more dogs and seeing no more flickering lights bartholemy left the marsh and set out on his long journey down the coast
16,441-128982-0015.flac,but none of the balls struck the pirate or his jars and he soon floated out of sight and hearing kicking out with his legs and paddling as well as he could with one hand while he held on to the jars with the other he at last managed to reach the land
17,441-128982-0032.flac,which he made as sharp as he could then with these tools he undertook the construction of a raft working away like a beaver and using the sharpened nails instead of his teeth
18,441-128982-0013.flac,there was a fierce struggle but the pirate was quick and powerful and the sentinel was soon dead then carrying his two jars bartholemy climbed swiftly and noiselessly up the short ladder
19,441-128982-0008.flac,he succeeded in getting rid of his fetters and could move about as freely as a tiger in a cage to get out of this cage was bartholemy's first object it would be comparatively easy because in the course of time some one would come into the hold
20,441-128982-0033.flac,he cut down a number of small trees and when he had enough of these slender trunks he bound them together with reeds and osiers which he found on the river bank so after infinite labor and trial he constructed a raft which would bear him on the surface of the water
21,441-128982-0005.flac,and he did not at all desire to give up such a valuable addition to his crew but the merchant grew very angry for he knew that bartholeby had inflicted great injury on spanish commerce and as the captain would not listen to him he went to the governor of the town and reported the case
22,441-128982-0030.flac,bartholemy perceived an old board in which there were some long and heavy rusty nails greatly encouraged by this discovery the indefatigable traveller set about a work which resembled that of the old woman who wanted a needle
23,441-128982-0024.flac,although he could hear the roars and screams of wild beasts all about him any one who is afraid to go down into a dark cellar to get some apples from a barrel at the foot of the stairs can have no idea of the sort of mind possessed by bartholemy portuguez
24,441-128982-0029.flac,now a piece of good fortune happened to him although to an ordinary traveller it might have been considered a matter of no importance whatever on the edge of the shore where it had floated down from some region higher up the river
25,441-128982-0003.flac,and who had heard of his various exploits he therefore went to the captain of the vessel and informed him that he had on board one of the very worst pirates in the whole world whose wicked deeds were well known in various parts of the west indies
26,441-128982-0016.flac,and ran as fast as he could into the dark woods beyond the town bartholemy was now greatly in fear that when his escape was discovered he would be tracked by bloodhounds
27,441-128982-0018.flac,and where the water which covered the ground prevented the dogs from following his scent he had nothing to eat except a few roots of water plants but he was accustomed to privation and these kept him alive often he heard the hounds baying on the dry land adjoining the marsh
28,441-128982-0035.flac,even if he could not walk no athlete of the present day no matter if he should be a most accomplished circus man could reasonably expect to perform the feat which this bold pirate successfully accomplished for five or six leagues he went through that mangrove forest
29,441-128982-0028.flac,but a man in his situation would not be likely to give up readily
30,441-128982-0009.flac,and the athletic buccaneer thought that he could easily get the better of whoever might open the hatch but the next act in this truly melodramatic performance would be a great deal more difficult for in order to escape from the ship it would be absolutely necessary for bartholemy to swim to shore
31,441-128982-0026.flac,this was a wide river flowing through the inland country into the sea he made his way up the shore of this river for a considerable distance but it grew but little narrower and he could see no chance of getting across he could not swim
32,441-128982-0020.flac,which was forty leagues away but where he had reason to suppose he would find some friends when he came out from among the trees he mounted a small hill and looked back upon the town the public square was lighted and there in the middle of it he saw the gallows which had been erected for his execution
33,441-128982-0036.flac,never once setting his foot upon the ground by which is meant mud water and roots but swinging himself by his hands and arms from branch to branch as if he had been a great ape only resting occasionally drawing himself upon a stout limb where he might sit for a while and get his breath
34,441-128982-0023.flac,when he had made for himself what seemed to be a free passage he would dash in and hurry across at other times great forests stretched down to the very coast and through these he was obliged to make his way
35,441-128982-0011.flac,he was satisfied that this unwieldy contrivance would support him in the water among other things he had found in his rummagings about the hold was an old knife and with this in his hand he now sat waiting for a good opportunity to attack his sentinel
36,441-128982-0022.flac,but after a diet of roots shellfish must have been a very agreeable change and they gave him all the strength and vigor he needed very often he found streams and inlets which he was obliged to ford
37,441-130108-0023.flac,the troops sifting through the forest were sullen in the youth's company once a man's laugh rang out a dozen soldiers turned their faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure
38,441-130108-0030.flac,nobody seems to know where we go or why we go we just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here and get licked there and nobody knows what it's done for it makes a man feel like a damned kitten in a bag
39,441-130108-0003.flac,always the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and left and the din on the right had grown to frightful proportions the guns were roaring without an instant's pause for breath
40,441-130108-0037.flac,the day had grown more white until the sun shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest a sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward that part of the line where lay the youth's regiment the front shifted a trifle to meet it squarely
41,441-130108-0032.flac,and then we begin to fight and the rebs had an easy time of it don't tell me it's just luck i know better it's this derned old the friend seemed jaded but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of calm confidence
42,441-130108-0017.flac,but still still we don't have no luck well then if we fight like the devil and don't ever whip it must be the general's fault said the youth grandly and decisively
43,441-130108-0009.flac,the disordered hurrying lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields they were yelling shrill and exultant at this sight the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged he exploded in loud sentences
44,441-130108-0012.flac,he presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the commander of the forces maybe it watn't all his fault not alltogether
45,441-130108-0024.flac,the noise of firing dogged their footsteps sometimes it seemed to be driven a little way but it always returned again with increased insolence the men muttered and cursed throwing black looks in its direction
46,441-130108-0031.flac,now i'd like to know what the eternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow unless it was to give the rebs a reg'lar pot shot at us we came in here and got our legs all tangled up in these cussed briars
47,441-130108-0040.flac,the battle roar settled to a rolling thunder which was a single long explosion in the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men
48,441-130108-0004.flac,it seemed that the cannon had come from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous wrangle it became impossible to make a sentence heard the youth wished to launch a joke a quotation from newspapers he desired to say
49,441-130108-0034.flac,at this time there was an interposition by the savage minded lieutenant who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his men you boys shut right up
50,441-130108-0026.flac,increased to a loud and joyous burst and then as the sun went serenely up the sky throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets it broke forth into prolonged pealings the woods began to crackle as if afire
51,441-130108-0005.flac,all quiet on the rap a hannock but the guns refused to permit even a comment upon their uproar he never successfully concluded the sentence but at last the guns stopped and among the men in the rifle pits rumors again flew
52,441-130108-0015.flac,but no one questioned his right to deal in such words and presently he recovered his air of courage he went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning the brigadier said he never saw a new regiment fight the way we fought yesterday didn't he
53,441-130108-0019.flac,the speech pierced the youth inwardly he was reduced to an abject pulp by these chance words his legs quaked privately he cast a frightened glance at the sarcastic man why no he hastened to say in a conciliating voice
54,441-130108-0007.flac,stories of disaster were borne into their minds with many proofs this din of musketry on the right growing like a released genie of sound expressed and emphasized the army's plight the men were disheartened and began to mutter
55,441-130108-0014.flac,don't we do all that men can demanded the youth loudly he was secretly dumbfounded at this sentiment when it came from his lips for a moment his face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about him
56,441-130108-0022.flac,he became suddenly a modest person there was low toned talk among the troops the officers were impatient and snappy their countenances clouded with the tales of misfortune
57,441-130108-0018.flac,and i don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting yet always losing through some durned old lunkhead of a general
58,441-130108-0010.flac,observed a man his friend recently aroused was still very drowsy he looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement then he sighed oh well i s'pose we got licked
59,441-130108-0008.flac,and it could always be seen that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could not fully comprehend a defeat before the gray mists had been totally obliterated by the sun rays the regiment was marching in a spread column that was retiring carefully through the woods
60,441-130108-0011.flac,he remarked sadly the youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men he made an attempt to restrain himself but the words upon his tongue were too bitter
61,441-130108-0033.flac,oh the devil it will you always talk like a dog hanged parson don't tell me i know
62,441-130108-0002.flac,he could see the low line of trenches but for a short distance a few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills
63,441-130108-0028.flac,who were lying down behind whatever protection they had collected a battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance the regiment unmolested as yet
64,441-130108-0006.flac,like birds but they were now for the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope the men's faces grew doleful from the interpreting of omens
65,441-130108-0013.flac,it's our luck to get licked offin said his friend in a weary tone he was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been caned and kicked well don't we fight like the devil
66,441-130108-0001.flac,this part of the world led a strange battleful existence the youth's regiment was marched to relieve a command that had lain long in some damp trenches the men took positions behind a curving line of rifle pits that had been turned up like a large furrow
67,441-130108-0041.flac,they were worn exhausted having slept but little and labored much
68,441-130108-0036.flac,less talkin an more fightin is what's best for you boys i never saw such gabblin jackasses he paused ready to pounce upon any man who might have the temerity to reply
69,441-130108-0038.flac,there was a wait in this part of the field there passed slowly the intense moments that precede the tempest a single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment in an instant it was joined by many others
70,441-130108-0020.flac,i don't think i fought the whole battle yesterday but the other seemed innocent of any deeper meaning apparently he had no information it was merely his habit oh he replied in the same tone of calm derision
71,441-130108-0027.flac,said a man here we are everybody fighting blood and destruction
72,441-130108-0025.flac,in a clear space the troops were at last halted regiments and brigades broken and detached through their encounters with thickets grew together again and lines were faced towards the pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry
73,441-130108-0039.flac,there was a mighty song of clashes and crashes that went sweeping through the woods the guns in the rear aroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burlike at them suddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band of guns
74,441-130108-0035.flac,you've been jawin like a lot o old hens
75,441-130108-0029.flac,awaited the moment when the gray shadows of the woods before them should be slashed by the lines of flame there was much growling and swearing good god the youth grumbled we're always being chased around like rats it makes me sick
76,441-130108-0016.flac,in his reply the friend's voice was stern of course not he said
77,441-130108-0021.flac,the youth nevertheless felt a threat his mind shrank from going near to the danger and thereafter he was silent the significance of the sarcastic man's words took from him all loud moods that would make him appear prominent
78,441-130108-0000.flac,a sputtering of musketry was always to be heard later the cannon had entered the dispute in the fog filled air the voices made a thudding sound the reverberations were continual
79,441-128988-0029.flac,when this message was received by the dignified official who filled the post of governor of cuba he stormed and fairly foamed at the mouth to be utterly foiled and discomfited by this resurrected pirate
80,441-128988-0033.flac,consequently it was represented to the governor that his plan of vengeance would work most disastrously for the spanish settlers for the buccaneers could do far more damage to them than he could possibly do to these dreadful brethren of the coast
81,441-128988-0034.flac,and that unless he wished to bring upon them troubles greater than those of famine or pestilence they begged that he would retract his oath when the high dignitary had cooled down a little he saw that there was a good deal of sense in what the representative of the people had said to him
82,441-128988-0030.flac,and to be afterwards addressed in terms of such unheard of insolence and abuse was more than he could bear and in the presence of many of his officials and attendants he swore a terrible oath that after that hour he would never again give quarter to any buccaneer
83,441-128988-0035.flac,and he also discovered much to his surprise that there were very few provisions on board for when the vessel was sent from havana it was supposed she would make but a very short cruise
84,441-128988-0032.flac,and they feared that when it became known that no buccaneer was to receive quarter the spanish colonists would be treated in the same way no matter where they might be found and taken
85,441-128988-0031.flac,but when the inhabitants of havanna and the surrounding villages heard of this terrible resolution of their governor they were very much disturbed they lived in constant danger of attack especially those who were engaged in fishing or maritime pursuits
86,441-128988-0028.flac,and there he composed a letter to the governor of havanna a part of which read as follows i shall never henceforward give quarter unto any spaniard whatsoever
87,441-128988-0021.flac,l'olonnois now stood a proud victor on the deck of his prize and being a man of principle he determined to live up to the distinguished reputation which he had acquired in that part of the world
88,441-128988-0010.flac,by the time the war vessel had arrived at de los cayo's l'olonnois had made his preparation to attack the place he had procured two large canoes and in these he had intended to row up to the town and land with his men
89,441-128988-0022.flac,baring his muscular and hairy right arm he clutched the handle of his sharp and heavy cutlass and ordered the prisoners to be brought up from below one at a time and conducted to the place where he stood
90,441-128988-0003.flac,he did not go out in search of ships but directed his vessel to a little village called de los cayos on the coast of cuba for here he thought was a chance for a good and easy stroke of business
91,441-128988-0008.flac,it was almost impossible for him to believe it the good news of the death of l'olonnois had come frome campeachy to havanna and the people of the latter town also rejoiced greatly to be now told that this scourge of the west indies was alive
92,441-128988-0016.flac,the man of war was anchored not very far from the town and when about two o'clock in the morning the watch on deck saw some canoes approaching they supposed them to be boats from shore
93,441-128988-0012.flac,with cannon and a well armed crew would have altered his plans so completely that he would have left that part of the coast of cuba with all possible expedition but the pirates of that day seemed to pay very little attention to the element of odds
94,441-128988-0004.flac,so that large ships could not approach very near and thus the villagers were kept busy carrying goods an supplies in small boats backwards and forwards from the town to the vessels at anchor
95,441-128988-0009.flac,and was about to fall upon a peaceful little village on the island over which he ruled filled the governor with rage as well as amazement and he ordered a well armed ship with a large crew of fighting men to sail immediately for the los cayos
96,441-128988-0015.flac,and he also needed a larger force than he had with him and he therefore captured some men who were fishing along the coast and put them into his canoes to help work the oars then by night he proceeded slowly in the direction of the spanish vessel
97,441-128988-0007.flac,informing the governor of the island that the cruel pirate l'olonnois was in a ship a short distance from their village which he undoubtedly intended to attack when the governor heard this astonishing tale
98,441-128988-0023.flac,he wished to give spain a lesson which would make her understand that he was not to be interfered with in the execution of his enterprises and he determined to allow himself the pleasure of personally teaching this lesson
99,441-128988-0011.flac,but now there was a change in the state of affairs and he was obliged to alter his plans the ordinary person in command of two small boats who should suddenly discover that a village which he supposed almost defenceless was protected by a large man of war
100,441-128988-0006.flac,he cruised about the coast at some distance from de los cayos endeavoring to procure two small boats in which to approach the town but although his preparations were made as quietly as possible the presence of his vessel was discovered by some fishermen
101,441-128988-0027.flac,who had been preserved from the fate of the others because l'olonnois had some correspondence to attend to and he needed a messenger to carry a letter the pirate captain went into the cabin where he found writing materials ready to his hand
102,441-128988-0025.flac,and when the poor fellow had finished by telling that he had come there not of his own accord but simply for the purpose of obeying his master to hang all the pirates except their leader that great buccaneer laughed and finding he could get nothing more from the negro
103,441-128988-0013.flac,if they met an enemy who was weak they would fall upon him and if they met with one who was a good deal stronger than themselves they would fall upon him all the same when the time came to fight they fought
104,441-128988-0014.flac,but no intention of giving up his project entered his mind as the spanish vessel was in his way he would attack her and get her out of his way if the thing could be done in this new state of affairs he was obliged to use stratagem
105,441-128988-0001.flac,that he had come back a comparative pauper surprised no one for this was a common thing to happen to a pirate but the wonder was that he got back at all he had no money but by the exercise of his crafty abilities
106,441-128988-0019.flac,one canoe attacking her on one side and the other on the other before the spanish could comprehend what had happened there were more than twenty pirates upon their decks the dreaded l'olonnois at their head
107,441-128988-0026.flac,cut off his head likewise and his body was tumbled into the sea after those of his companions now there was not a spaniard left on board the great ship except one man
108,441-128988-0018.flac,but their way was a very different one from any which could have been expected by the captain of the ship they rowed off into the darkness instead of going toward the town and waited until nearly daybreak then they boldly made for the man of war
109,441-128988-0005.flac,here was a nice little prize that could not get away from him and l'olonnois had plenty of time to make his preparations to seize it as he could not sail a ship directly up to the town
110,441-128988-0024.flac,this man who was not a soldier was desperately frightened and begged piteously for his life l'olonnois finding that the man was willing to tell everything he knew questioned him about the sending of this vessel from havanna
111,441-128988-0017.flac,for as has been said such vessels were continually plying about those shallow waters the canoes were hailed and after having given an account of themselves they were asked if they knew anything about the pirate ship upon the coast
112,441-128988-0020.flac,and they fought each scoundrel of them like three men and the savage fight ended by every spanish sailor or officer who was not killed or wounded being forced to stay below decks where the hatches were securely fastened down upon them
113,441-128988-0000.flac,chapter thirteen a resurrected pirate
114,441-128988-0002.flac,he managed to get possession of a ship which he manned with a crew of about a score of impecunious dare devils who were very anxious to do something to mend their fortunes having now become very fond of land fighting

210,1447-17506-0018.flac,he has given his name as ferralti but added no title a count did you say yes replied uncle john the proprietor looked curiously toward the young man whose back only was visible
211,1447-17506-0033.flac,i do not imagine we shall see much of this young man in any event and now that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colours you will know how to handle him better than i can advise you
212,1447-17506-0011.flac,the count clung to louise's side but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins
213,1447-17506-0014.flac,to establish friendly relations with his girls next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel was a brother of that floriano who managed the hotel de visuvre
214,1447-17506-0026.flac,he carefully placed the card in his pocket book thank you said he it is a fine morning count charming mister merrick uncle john walked away he was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly
215,1447-17506-0007.flac,new york adopts a good many said uncle john drily it has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me the dancers entered at that moment and the americans were forced to seat themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others
216,1447-17506-0003.flac,a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her
217,1447-17506-0010.flac,afterward uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of red hot scoria toward the sky
218,1447-17506-0005.flac,introducing him to uncle john and her cousins as count ferralti whom she had once met in new york while he was on a visit to america
219,1447-17506-0000.flac,chapter nine count ferralti
220,1447-17506-0034.flac,said louise slowly as she resumed her writing well then girls what do you say to a stroll around the village asked their uncle i'm told it's a proper place to buy silk stockings and inlaid woodwork they come assorted i suppose
221,1447-17506-0013.flac,but there was something in the appearance of the callo italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow
222,1447-17506-0004.flac,he was a nice looking young fellow beth thought and had a foreign and quite distinguished air presently louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party
223,1447-17506-0024.flac,and no such noble family segnor merrick uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow i misunderstood your name last evening he said i thought you were count ferralti
224,1447-17506-0022.flac,observe signor here is our record of nobility it is the same as the blue book or the peerage of england either fortunately or unfortunately i cannot say you have no need of such a book in america
225,1447-17506-0002.flac,as they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance louise gave a start of surprise
226,1447-17506-0006.flac,the count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that patsy thought affected and said in excellent english
227,1447-17506-0027.flac,when an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous he joined his nieces who were all busy engaged in writing letters home and remarked casually you've been deceived in your italian friend louise
228,1447-17506-0009.flac,who seemed very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present the tarantella originated in iscia but sorento and capri have the best dancers
229,1447-17506-0021.flac,my dear signor there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all italy yet you say you don't know the feralti family
230,1447-17506-0031.flac,or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might enjoy moreover louise being in love with that young weldom her mother so strongly objected to
231,1447-17506-0025.flac,and that is right sir was the prompt reply allow me to offer you my card uncle john took the card and read conte leonardi ferralti milano italia
232,1447-17506-0015.flac,that gave him an excuse to talk with the man who spoke very good english and was exceedingly courteous to his guests especially when they were american
233,1447-17506-0017.flac,he turned to his list of guests who register by card and not in a book and continued
234,1447-17506-0012.flac,and beth replied that his manners were so like those of their cousin louise that the two ought to get along nicely together uncle john liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men generally to meet them
235,1447-17506-0028.flac,he is neither a count nor of noble family although i suppose when you met him in new york he had an object imposing as a titled aristocrat the girl paused examining the point of her pen thoughtfully
236,1447-17506-0020.flac,that i cannot tell you signor merick oh perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country i i know little of the nobility answered floriano indignantly
237,1447-17506-0030.flac,uncle john hardly knew what to say further he felt he was in an awkward position for louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian
238,1447-17506-0001.flac,at dinner it was announced that the famous tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine o'clock and the girls told uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight which is one of the most unique in sorento or indeed in all italy
239,1447-17506-0016.flac,count ferralti the young man standing by the window yonder i i did not know he said hesitatingly the gentleman arrived last evening and i had not yet learned his name let me see
240,1447-17506-0008.flac,count ferralti found the place beside louise but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment the dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troop of laughing peasants dressed in native costume
241,1447-17506-0019.flac,then he remarked that the iruption of vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time
242,1447-17506-0023.flac,he turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of f find me if you can a count ferraldi in the list uncle john looked he put on his glasses and looked again
243,1447-17506-0032.flac,she would not be likely to care much for this italian fellow and missus merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughter's mind from dwelling on her entanglement oh well my dear he said to her you must act as you see fit
244,5561-41615-0043.flac,good bye grace chorused her friends and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of the would be truants to return to those youthful transgressors they were spending a most uncomfortable half hour with miss thompson she was merciless in her denunciation of their conduct
245,5561-41615-0034.flac,grace was thoroughly angry with her she could not forgive eleanor for having accused her and her friends of carrying tales before almost the entire school therefore a forced apology would not appeace her wounded pride
246,5561-41615-0006.flac,mabel nodded what was written on it mabel asked grace curiously mabel looked distressed for a moment then she said
247,5561-41615-0030.flac,i will not tolerate such behavior eleanor glared at the principal whose face was rigid in its purpose then sank into the nearest vacant seat saying defiantly you may keep me here all night if you like
248,5561-41615-0010.flac,we don't want you to tell if it doesn't concern us we don't care do we girls no indeed was the reply just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved
249,5561-41615-0024.flac,i wrote it miss thompson she said clearly i wrote it because i wished to
250,5561-41615-0046.flac,when the last girl had disappeared the principal turned to eleanor
251,5561-41615-0015.flac,that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus matinee or any public performance of this nature i have so severely disciplined pupils for this offence that for a long time no one has disobeyed me
252,5561-41615-0019.flac,and that a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils who pledged themselves to play truant and attend the matinee to morrow the eyes of grace and her chums turned questioningly toward mabel allison who nodded slightly in the affirmative so that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant
253,5561-41615-0026.flac,if you have that paper in your possession bring it to me at once and never answer me again as you did just now you are both disrespectful and impertinent but miss thompson's anger toward eleanor was nothing compared with the tempest that the principal had aroused in eleanor
254,5561-41615-0000.flac,chapter fifteen a would be lark
255,5561-41615-0017.flac,such a decision is worse than disobedience it is lawlessness
256,5561-41615-0036.flac,the girls silently donned their wraps and fled from the building like fugitives from justice once on the street a lively confab ensued all talking at once let's take turns talking cried grace laughing we shall understand each other a little better
257,5561-41615-0013.flac,and then she looked towards grace whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention i don't believe grace is guilty at any rate thought miss thompson then she addressed the assembled girls something has come to my ears girls said the principal
258,5561-41615-0041.flac,no said grace shortly she deserves to be punished the things she said to miss thompson were disgraceful and i shall never forgive her for the way she spoke of us i wouldn't say that grace remarked anne you can never tell what may happen to change your views
259,5561-41615-0038.flac,i suppose it did look as though i told you girls said mabel allison who had joined them at the gate you know i was with you at recess right after the paper had been passed to me
260,5561-41615-0035.flac,she drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door hurry up she said we'll talk when we get outside school don't stop for a minute if miss thompson notices that we are gone she'll send after us
261,5561-41615-0040.flac,there will be weeping and wailing in the skull and cross bones crowd exclaimed nora they are all in this mix up and if they aren't suspended they'll be lucky
262,5561-41615-0018.flac,the standard of the school will be lowered therefore i intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous influence prompted this act of insubordination report says that this movement originated in the junior class
263,5561-41615-0021.flac,what i insist upon knowing now is who are the real culprits beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it
264,5561-41615-0037.flac,she has certainly shown her true colors this time i never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her old plan said marian barber it was abominable said eva allen the other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms
265,5561-41615-0003.flac,at recess there was more grouping and whispering and grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year
266,5561-41615-0023.flac,after they had stood for what seemed to them in age but was really only a couple of minutes you may be seated the girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself without hesitating eleanor rose and regarded the principal with an insolent smile
267,5561-41615-0005.flac,here comes mabel said jessica maybe she has seen the paper
268,5561-41615-0048.flac,you may apologize to me now and to morrow to the girls you have accused of treachery
269,5561-41615-0025.flac,because it has spoiled all our fun there was a gasp of horror at eleanor's assertion no one had ever before spoken so disrespectfully to their revered principal miss savell said the principal quietly although her flashing eyes and set lips showed that she was very angry
270,5561-41615-0009.flac,i can't bear to have secrets and not tell you
271,5561-41615-0002.flac,and as the morning advanced they became fully aware that something unusual was in the wind several times they caught sight of a folded paper being stealthily passed from one desk to another but as to its contents they had no idea as it was not handed to any one of them
272,5561-41615-0039.flac,it was passed to me by mistake very likely agreed grace i wonder who did tell miss thompson i saw several girls with the paper
273,5561-41615-0014.flac,that i find hard to credit but before you leave here this afternoon i must know who is innocent and who is guilty miss thompson paused and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats while a few glanced quickly toward eleanor who was looking straight ahead the picture of innocence
274,5561-41615-0001.flac,the majority however appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard one group standing near one of the windows of which eleanor was the centre laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats
275,5561-41615-0020.flac,grace inwardly congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing none of her friends were implicated either even mabel had refused to sign
276,5561-41615-0033.flac,grace motioned the girls to hurry she wished to leave the room with her friends before miss thompson noticed them she knew the principal would insist on an apology from eleanor and neither she nor her friends wished it for the first time since eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance
277,5561-41615-0028.flac,words cannot express my contempt for them and right here i accuse grace harlowe and her sorority of getting the information from mabel allison yesterday and carrying it to you they are all tail bearers and sneaks
278,5561-41615-0032.flac,those girls who are not in any way implicated in this matter are dismissed she said about one third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall the pie sigma tau being among the number
279,5561-41615-0031.flac,nevertheless she did not again attempt to leave the room she had met with a will stronger than her own and she realized it ignoring eleanor's final remark miss thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand
280,5561-41615-0044.flac,and the terror of suspension arose in more than one mind as they listened to her scathing remarks
281,5561-41615-0008.flac,and did you sign it asked jessica i certainly did not responded mabel it was she stopped then flushed

283,5561-41615-0029.flac,with these words eleanor angrily flung the book she held on the desk and walked down the aisle towards the door but miss thompson barred her way stop miss savell she commanded
284,5561-41615-0022.flac,her example was followed until two thirds of the girls present were standing the principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly discomfiting that will do she said curtly

287,5561-41615-0011.flac,on wednesday aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall it was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when miss thompson walked into the room
288,5561-41615-0016.flac,i was therefore astonished to learn that a number of girls regardless of the rules have taken matters into their own hands and have decided to absent themselves from school to morrow in order to attend the matinee to be given in the theatre
289,5561-41615-0045.flac,but there was nothing funny about it now when with the exception of eleanor the principal dismissed them they followed decorously out very uneasy in mind miss thompson had taken their names but had not stated their punishment and it was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure
290,5561-41615-0027.flac,the latter flushed then turned perfectly white with rage still standing she reached down

327,5561-39621-0030.flac,then the general sent me back the letter by an aid de camp informing me that if i were found the next day within the circumscription of his command he would have me arrested
328,5561-39621-0021.flac,cripole was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks without observing that an old man on foot but leading a small irish horse by the bridle was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the entrance of the medici but at that moment the voice of the stranger was heard from the window
329,5561-39621-0045.flac,my good parry said he order a fire drink eat sleep and be happy let us both be happy my faithful friend my only friend we are rich as rich as kings

332,5561-39621-0009.flac,cries arose in the distance a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city and the first distinct sounds that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses
333,5561-39621-0040.flac,well well my lord said parry more uneasy at the turn the conversation had taken than at the other you know resumed the unknown that my mother and my sister whilst all this is going on in honor of the king of france have neither money nor bread you know that i myself shall be poor and degraded within a fortnight

335,5561-39621-0042.flac,no no i have two arms parry and i have a sword and he struck his arm violently with his hand and took down his sword which hung against the wall
336,5561-39621-0044.flac,and with these words which he finished sharply with a nervous and terrible laugh the young man girded on his sword took his hat from the trunk
337,5561-39621-0035.flac,the old man endeavored to change the conversation it was leading to thoughts much too sinister
338,5561-39621-0028.flac,but in the name of heaven do not tremble so it is impatience parry come what did the general say to you at first the general would not receive me
339,5561-41616-0020.flac,and all the baskets soon will land we shout we sing the praises of the seniors hardly had the last notes died away when the refere blew the whistle and the teams hustled to their positions grace and julia crosby faced each other beamed amiably and shook hands
340,5561-41616-0035.flac,just before the last half started miss thompson and miss kane came in and walked to the other end of the gallery well eleanor and her crowd saw them
341,5561-41616-0010.flac,wasn't it nice of miss thompson to exonerate us publicly asked anne she is always just replied grace i can't understand how eleanor could be so rude and disagreeable to her she as disliked miss thompson from the first i wonder whether she apologized to miss thompson last night mused grace
342,5561-41616-0005.flac,twas many and many a year ago in an age beyond recall that nora the freshman lowly sat
343,5561-41616-0025.flac,this ended the first half with a score five to two in favor of the juniors they'll have to work to catch up with us now said noromalley triumphantly to the members of the team who sat resting in the little side room off the gymnasium we have the lead but we can't afford to boast yet replied grace
344,5561-41616-0011.flac,i feel sure that she didn't and i'm just as sure that she won't get back until she does we shall manage to exist if she doesn't said jessica dryly
345,5561-41616-0012.flac,she felt a personal grudge against eleanor for her accusation against mabel who had grown very dear to her and whom she mothered like a hen with one chick she'll probably appear at the game in all her glory said miriam nesbit
346,5561-41616-0032.flac,ruddy circled about the victors almost too delighted for words he was filled with profound admiration for them the boy's crack team couldn't have played a better game he said solemnly and the girls knew that he could pay them no higher compliments for this team was considered invincible by the high school boys
347,5561-41616-0015.flac,julia crosby and grace took turns sprinting around the gymnasium three times in succession while miriam nesbet timed them grace finishing just two seconds ahead of julia by a quarter of two the gallery was fairly well filled and by five minutes of two it was crowded
348,5561-41616-0030.flac,and the sensational playing of nora and miriam was a matter of wonder to the spectators who conceded it to be the fastest most brilliant half ever played by an oak dale team
349,5561-41616-0009.flac,i have been practising a most encouraging howl hippy david and reddy have a new one too reddy says it's marvelously extraordinary and appallingly great
350,5561-41616-0017.flac,a tall junior who stood up and beat time with both hands anne had composed the song the week before the juniors had all received copies of the words and had learned them by heart they now sang with the utmost glee and came out particularly strong on the chorus which ran
351,5561-41616-0002.flac,they must turn in two themes every week of not less than six hundred words on certain subjects to be assigned to them if during this time any one of them should be reported for a misdemeanor they were to be suspended without delay
352,5561-41616-0021.flac,then stood vigilant eyes on the ball that the referie balanced in her hands up it went the whistle sounded and the two captains sprang straight for it grace captured it however
353,5561-41616-0016.flac,the juniors with the exception of eleanor savell's faction arrived in a body gave the high school yell the moment they spied their team
354,5561-41616-0038.flac,she talked for a moment to edna and eleanor they tossed their heads but they didn't hiss any more what did ruth say to them asked grace curiously
355,5561-41616-0007.flac,by the way anne said grace as you are a poet you must compose a basketball song to day and i'll see that the juniors all have copies it's time we had one let me see what would be a good tune rally round the flag suggested miriam nesbit that has a dandy swing to it
356,5561-41616-0033.flac,perhaps we'll challenge you some day ready said grace mischievously i believe you'd win at that he said so earnestly that everyone laughed it was a great triumph said jessica proudly as she stood with mabel and anne in the locker room while the girls resumed street clothing and mi new howel was a success too
357,5561-41616-0022.flac,and sent it flying toward miriam who was so carefully guarded that she dared not attempt to make the basket and after a feint managed to throw it to nora who tried for the basket at long range and missed there was a general scramble for the ball and for five minutes neither team scored
358,5561-41616-0014.flac,and rapidly donned their gymnasium suits the spectators had not yet begun to arrive as it was still early so the girls indulged in a little warming up practice did a few stunts and skipped about overflowing with animal spirits
359,5561-41616-0037.flac,they were sitting down front on the same side as eleanor's crowd you know what a temper ruth deane has and how ferocious she can look
360,5561-41616-0036.flac,hard to tell said nora they hissed miss thompson very softly you may be sure continued jessica but it was hissing just the same
361,5561-41616-0031.flac,whose loyal supporters swooped down upon them the moment the whistle blew and pranced about whooping like savages that was the greatest game i ever saw plate under this roof cried david wringing grace's hand while hippy hopped about uttering little yelps of joy
362,5561-41616-0006.flac,what a delicate way of reminding me that i once was a freshman she exclaimed anne has a new accomplishment said grace she can spout poetry without trying small credit is due me said anne smiling any one can twist annabel lee to suit the occasion
363,5561-41616-0013.flac,the recess bell cut short the conversation and the girls returned to their desks with far better ideas of the coming game than of the afternoon's lessons saturday december twelfth dawned cold and clear as the girls on both teams were in high spirits as they hustled into their respective locker rooms
364,5561-41616-0034.flac,glad to know that said grace there were so many different kinds of noises i couldn't distinguish it there was one noise that started that was promptly hushed said anne you heard it too didn't you jessica oh yes girls i intended telling you before this replied jessica
365,5561-41616-0004.flac,thank goodness none of us were concerned in that affair she told the members of her basketball team at recess there are two girls in the sophomore and three on the freshman team whose basketwall ardor will have to cool until after the mid year exams
366,5561-41616-0018.flac,the juniors forever hurrah ann's hurrah our team is a winner
367,5561-41616-0024.flac,they played such a close guarded game that try as they might the juniors made no headway then julia crosby scored on a field gold making the score three to two this spurred the junior team on to greater effort and miryam made a brilliant throw to basket that brought forth an ovation from the gallery
368,5561-41616-0019.flac,shouting the warcry of the juniors there was a great clapping of hands from the admirers of the juniors at this effort but the seniors promptly responded from the other end of the gallery to the tune of dixie with the seniors are the real thing hurrah hurrah our gallant team now takes its stand
369,5561-41616-0028.flac,then we'll see that she goes away in a gloomy frame of mind said nora for we're going to win and don't you forget to remember it
370,5561-41616-0003.flac,their penalty was far from light but they had not been suspended and so they resolved to endure it as best they might grace harlowe felt a load lifted from her mind when miss thompson publicly announced that she had not received any information from either mabel allison or the pie sigmatau
371,5561-41616-0001.flac,after conducting opening exercises miss thompson pronounced sentence on the culprits they were to forfeit their recess library and all other privileges until the end of the term
372,5561-41616-0023.flac,then mirian barber dropped a neat field gold and soon after grace scored on a foul the junior fans howled joyfully at the good work of their team the seniors did not intend to allow them to score again in a hurry

412,669-129061-0034.flac,but his hand shook and he was so agitated that the pocket book fell from him and out of it the thousand pound note which had been the last of the unlucky becky's winnings
413,669-129061-0058.flac,for his acquaintances with the greatest prudence and skill his royal highness the late lamented commander in chief had had the greatest regard for macmurdo on this account
414,669-129061-0041.flac,as they knelt down to prayers which sir pitt read to them and to the servants in their sunday suits or liveries ranged upon chairs on the other side of the hissing tea ern
415,669-129061-0010.flac,otherwise he would by no means permit the introduction of sunday papers into his household the theatrical criticisms the fight for a hundred pounds aside between the barking butcher
416,669-129061-0053.flac,and a number of ladies of the courps des ballet and old mac who was at home with people of all ages and ranks and consorted with generals dog fanciers opera dancers bruisers

419,669-129061-0026.flac,she said she was ill in bed and put me off to another day and when i got home i found her in diamonds and sitting with that villain alone
420,669-129061-0020.flac,never mind what happens to me what is the matter then said pitt somewhat relieved it's the boy said rawdon in a husky voice
421,669-129061-0039.flac,and the dark looks of her husband that there was very little question of breakfast between them rawdon muttered some excuses about an engagement squeezing hard the timid little hand
422,669-129061-0003.flac,rawdon sat down in the study before the baronet's table
423,669-129061-0023.flac,i wish i was rawdon replied if it wasn't for little rawdon i'd have cut my throat this morning and that damned villains too
424,669-129061-0030.flac,the elder brother was much affected and shook rawdon's hand with a cordiality seldom exhibited by him rawdon passed his hand over his shaggy eyebrows
425,669-129061-0035.flac,pitt stooped and pick them up amazed at so much wealth not that rawdon said i hope to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs to
426,669-129061-0055.flac,he had a singular museum he was one of the best shots in england and for a heavy man one of the best writers indeed he and crawley
427,669-129061-0024.flac,sir pitt instantly guessed the truth and surmise that lord steyne was the person whose life rawdon wished to take the colonel told his senior briefly and in broken accents
428,669-129061-0006.flac,he had read in the journal a flaming account of festivities at gaunt house
429,669-129061-0016.flac,that one placed for the reception of the stewart agent or confidential visitor who came to transact business with the baronet and trimmed his nails more vehemently than ever pitt
430,669-129061-0004.flac,and the letters the neatly docketed bills and symmetrical pamphlets the locked account books desks and dispatch boxes the bible the quarterly review and the court guide
431,669-129061-0011.flac,punctually as the shrill toned bell of the black marble study clock began to chine nine sir pitt made his appearance fresh neat smugly shaved
432,669-129061-0013.flac,a model of neatness and every propriety he started when he saw poor rawdon in his study in tumbled clothes with blood shot eyes and his hair over his face
433,669-129061-0009.flac,so that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the arrival of the master of the house poor rawdon took up the paper and began to try and read it until his brother should arrive
434,669-129061-0001.flac,in her morning gown was up and above stairs in the nursery superintending the toilets of her children and listening to the morning prayers which the little creatures performed at her knee
435,669-129061-0050.flac,were thronged with people out upon their sunday pleasure but the colonel was much too busy to take any heed of this phenomena and arriving at knightsbridge
436,669-129061-0031.flac,thank you brother said he i know i can trust your word i will upon my honor the baronet said and thus and almost mutely
437,669-129061-0052.flac,a veteran officer and waterloo man greatly liked by his regiment in which want of money alone prevented him from attaining the highest ranks was enjoying the forenoon calmly in bed
438,669-129061-0057.flac,dyed moustache when rawdon told the captain he wanted a friend the latter knew perfectly well on what duty of friendship he was called to act and indeed had conducted scores of affairs
439,669-129061-0007.flac,invited by the marquis of steyn to meet his royal highness
440,669-129061-0021.flac,i want you to promise me that you will take charge of him when i'm gone that dear good wife of yours has always been good to him and he's fonder of her than he is of his damn it look here pitt
441,669-129061-0014.flac,he thought his brother was not sober
442,669-129061-0022.flac,but for this i might have been quite a different man i didn't do my duty with the regiment so bad you know how i was thrown over about the money and who got it
443,669-129061-0025.flac,the circumstances of the case it was a regular plan between that scoundrel and her he said the bailiffs were put upon me i was taken as i was going out of his house when i wrote to her for money
444,669-129061-0008.flac,and her niece as they were taking early tea and hot buttered toast in the former lady's apartment and wondered how the rawding crawleys could get on the valet had damped and folded the paper once more
445,669-129061-0043.flac,to go to church though her thoughts had been entirely astray during the period of family devotion rawdon crawley meanwhile hurried on from great gaunt street and knocking at the great
446,669-129061-0051.flac,speedily made his way up to the room of his old friend and comrade captain macmurdo who crawley found to his satisfaction was in barracks captain macmurdo
447,669-129061-0017.flac,even the hundred pounds that jane took you last night were promised to my lawyer to morrow morning and the want of it will put me to great inconvenience
448,669-129061-0046.flac,as he strode away so did the people in their sunday clothes who were out so early the charity boys with shining faces the green grocer lolling at his door
449,669-129061-0044.flac,brought out the purple salinus in a red and silver waistcoat who acts as porter of that palace the man was scared also by the colonel's dishevelled appearance
450,669-129061-0012.flac,his scanty hair combed and oiled trimming his nails as he descended the stairs majestically in a starched cravit and a grey flannel dressing gown a real old english gentleman in a word
451,669-129061-0042.flac,breakfast was so late that day in consequence of the delays which had occurred that the church bells began to ring whilst they were sitting over their meal and lady jane was too ill she said
452,669-129061-0005.flac,on the study table and awaiting his judicious selection and by the sermon book was the observer newspaper damp and neatly folded and for sir pitt's own private use

454,669-129061-0032.flac,and i've always felt ashamed of having taken the poor old woman's money and here's some more i've only kept back a few pounds which becky may as well have
455,669-129061-0036.flac,to rap a ball in the note and killsteine with it after this coloquet the brothers once more shook hands and parted
456,669-129061-0029.flac,rawdon said with a broken voice and as the boy has no mother i must leave him to you and jane pitt only it will be a comfort to me if you will promise me to be his friend
457,669-129061-0027.flac,he then went on to describe hurriedly the personal conflict with lord steyne to an affair of that nature of course he said there was but one issue
458,669-129061-0038.flac,as the two brothers passed out of the study she held out her hand to rawdon and said she was glad he was come to breakfast though she could perceive by his haggard unshorn face
459,669-129061-0033.flac,to get on with as he spoke
460,669-129061-0028.flac,and after his conference with his brother he was going away to make the necessary arrangements for the meeting which must ensue
461,669-129061-0054.flac,and every kind of person in a word was resting himself after the night's labours and not being on duty was in bed his room was hung round with boxing sporting and dancing pictures
462,669-129061-0048.flac,barracks all the bells were jangling and tolling as he reached that place
463,669-129061-0018.flac,i don't mean to say that i won't assist you ultimately but as for paying your creditors in full i might as well hope to pay the national debt
464,669-129074-0031.flac,when i'm in the army won't i hate the french that's all
465,669-129074-0003.flac,she found herself suddenly and unexpectedly in snug comfortable quarters surrounded by friends kindness and good natured simple people
466,669-129074-0011.flac,she brought everybody to the house and she made joes believe that it was his own great social talents and wit
467,669-129074-0014.flac,and to such an angel as him whom she had had the good fortune to marry was married for ever but she had no objection to hear the major praised
468,669-129074-0000.flac,which contains births marriages and deaths whatever becky's private plan might be by which dobbin's true love was to be crowned with success
469,669-129074-0002.flac,she had a great number of things pertaining to herself to consider and which concerned her a great deal more than major dobbin's happiness in this life
470,669-129074-0010.flac,than they had been to bestow the same inestimable benefits upon amelia love and liberty are interpreted by those simple germans in a way which honest folks
471,669-129074-0022.flac,too how to love and to sing certain songs i say to which the major was partial
472,669-129074-0027.flac,over and over again she told him how they owed everything which they possessed in the world to that kind friend's benevolent care of them how he had befriended them all through their poverty and misfortunes
473,669-129074-0013.flac,she talked to her perpetually about major dobbin sent about his business and made no scruple of declaring her admiration for that excellent high minded gentleman
474,669-129074-0006.flac,of amelia he drove out with becky in his open carriage he asked little parties and invented festivities to do her honour tapeworm
475,669-129074-0025.flac,during which rebecca was left to the society of mister joseph
476,669-129074-0016.flac,it has been said was heart and soul in favor of the generous major having at first disliked becky for being the means of dismissing him from the presence of her mistress
477,669-129074-0030.flac,and their friendship never ceased from that day until the last when your dear father fell did dobbin kill the man who killed papa
478,669-129074-0012.flac,as for emmy who found herself not in the least mistress of her own house except when the bills were to be paid becky soon discovered the way to soothe and please her
479,669-129074-0024.flac,rummaging his mother's desk some time afterwards found the gloves neatly folded up
480,669-129074-0021.flac,was one of them that tender love song of webers which in old fashioned days young ladies and when you were scarcely born showed that those who lived before you knew
481,669-129074-0015.flac,and indeed brought the conversation round to the dobbin subject a score of times every day means were easily found to win the favor of georgy and the servants amelia's maid
482,669-129074-0009.flac,and the ladies were even more ready to call her due
483,669-129074-0019.flac,and as she looked at her husband's portrait of nights it no longer reproached her perhaps she reproached it now william was gone emmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice
484,669-129074-0017.flac,she was reconciled to missus crawley subsequently because the latter became william's most ardent admirer and champion and in those mighty conflaves in which the two lahties indulged after their parties
485,669-129074-0005.flac,she picketed her steed hung up her weapons and warmed herself comfortably by his fire the halt in that roving restless life was inexpressibly soothing and pleasant to her
486,669-129074-0007.flac,came to dine with jos and then came every day to pay his respects to becky poor emmy who was never very talkative and more glum and silent than ever after dobbin's departure was quite forgotten
487,669-129074-0018.flac,and while miss payne was brushing their airs
488,669-129074-0029.flac,and had been constantly befriended by the good william why when your papa was a little boy she said he often told me that it was william who defended him against a tyrant at the school where they were
489,669-129074-0001.flac,the little woman thought that the secret might keep and indeed being by no means so much interested
490,669-129074-0026.flac,in a way which even made the boy smile she told him that she thought major william was the best man in all the world the gentlest and the kindest the bravest and the humblest
491,669-129074-0023.flac,she would break off in the midst of the song
492,669-129074-0008.flac,there heard of her fascinations and were quite curious to know her when it became known that she was noble of an ancient english family that her husband was a colonel of the guard
493,669-129074-0020.flac,she was very distract nervous silent and ill to please the family had never known her so peevish she grew pale and ill
494,669-129074-0004.flac,and say his prayers in the mosque
495,669-129074-0028.flac,watched over them when nobody cared for them how all his comrades admired him though he never spoke of his own gallant actions how georgy's father trusted him beyond all other men
496,4195-17507-0047.flac,in spite of his courage he could eat no luncheon but merely sipped a gass of wine so uncle john alarmed at his pallor insisted that he'd take a seat in the carriage on the return journey
497,4195-17507-0023.flac,and has no duplicate in all the known world
498,4195-17507-0011.flac,it may be a bird but it don't look at said uncle john doubtfully
499,4195-17507-0026.flac,pilgrims when it rained they put up a carriage top which afforded but partial shelter
500,4195-17507-0018.flac,when the climate is little better than the prevailing in the eastern and central portions of the united states and perhaps one suffers more in italy than in america owing to the general lack of means to keep warm on cold days the italian
501,4195-17507-0020.flac,exaggerated the conditions by apostrophising the country essunny italy and for more than a century uttered such rhaphsodies in its praise that the whole world credited them until it acquired personal experience of the matter
502,4195-17507-0033.flac,the horses as soon as the strain upon their bits was relaxed were easily quieted
503,4195-17507-0043.flac,count ferralti rode at the side of the carriage but did not attempt much conversation
504,4195-17507-0038.flac,she kept her wits while the rest of us were scared to death uncle john had been observing the count one of the young man's hands hung limp and helpless are you hurt sir he asked ferralti smiled and his eyes rested upon louise
505,4195-17507-0002.flac,or at least ill desorto the others stood by to listen silently to the discussion yielding first place to the victor and the race uncle john was obdurate all we want to day is to see the town he declared we're not going to ride but walk
506,4195-17507-0032.flac,weight just above him was a slight ledge he could reach it now and then she had him by the arm so that another instant found him clinging to the parapet and drawing himself into a position of safety
507,4195-17507-0004.flac,to morrow signor it is good at what hour to morrow illustrissimo oh don't bother me we may as well drive to a malfy to morrow suggested beth it is the proper thing to do uncle all right we'll go then you take my carrazza signor
508,4195-17507-0035.flac,so opportunely was none other than count ferralti
509,4195-17507-0030.flac,at this critical moment a mounted horseman who unobserved had been following the party dashed to their rescue the rider caught the plunging steeds by their heads and tried to restrain their terror at his own eminent peril
510,4195-17507-0010.flac,it do not remain good for a long ride so i leave him home for i am kind i do not wish the signorini bella to tire and weep but see the fine vitura you now have is he not easy like feathers and strong
511,4195-17507-0045.flac,which was founded in the year twelve twelve from the arbored veranda of this charming retreat is obtained one of the finest views in europe and while the girls sat enjoying it uncle john arranged with a pleasant faced woman
512,4195-17507-0022.flac,the further slope and brought the carriage to the other side of the peninsula where the girls obtained their first view of the gulf of salerno with the lovely isles of the sirens lying just beneath them
513,4195-17507-0006.flac,it had beautiful carefully brushed cushions it was drawn by a pair of splendid looking horses is it not bellissimo signor asked the man proudly
514,4195-17507-0027.flac,from that distance the boats drawn upon the sheltered beach seemed like mere toys then they would span a chasm on a narrow stone bridge or plunged through an arch dividing the solid mountain
515,4195-17507-0037.flac,by every saint in the calendar that the girl had saved him from a frightful death and he would devote his future life to her service it is wonderful murmured ferralti
516,4195-17507-0039.flac,we'd better get back to sorento said uncle john abruptly
517,4195-17507-0041.flac,as if they had never known a moment's fear in their lives so the girl and their uncle climbed into the vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with his usual vigor
518,4195-17507-0000.flac,and shiny top boots his long legs enabled him to outstrip the others and in an almost breathless voice he begged uncle john to choose his carriage the best a karazza in a town we don't want to ride was the answer the cabman implored
519,4195-17507-0017.flac,they had sunshine rain hail snow and a tornado and then rain again and more sunshine sunny italy seemed a misnomer that day as indeed it does many days in winter and spring
520,4195-17507-0046.flac,who had once lived in america for their luncheon an hour later and just as they were sitting down to the meal count ferralti rejoined them
521,4195-17507-0036.flac,he was sitting upon his horse and staring with amazement at beth
522,4195-17507-0019.flac,for he will permit no reproach to lie on his beloved land but the traveller frequently becomes discouraged and the american contingent especially
523,4195-17507-0013.flac,it was standing just as it had before and beside it was another man dressed in a splendid uniform and his driver had claimed that he had left at home
524,4195-17507-0005.flac,let us see it instantly the crowd scampered back to the square followed more leisurely by uncle john and the girls there the uniform veturio stood beside the one modern carriage in the group it was new it was glossy
525,4195-17507-0028.flac,when the great adventure of the day overtook them without warning the wind came whistling around them in a great gale which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses reeling against the low parapet
526,4195-17507-0007.flac,be ready to start at nine o'clock to morrow morning the man promised whereat his confeers lost all interest in the matter and the strangers were allowed to proceed without further interruption they found out all about the amalfi drive that evening and were glad indeed they had decided to go
527,4195-17507-0003.flac,ah but the amalfi road signora surely you will see that
528,4195-17507-0048.flac,and beth mounted the box and rode beside her friend the driver
529,4195-17507-0040.flac,that is if you permit me to accompany you
530,4195-17507-0001.flac,certainly they must make the amalfi drive
531,4195-17507-0016.flac,indeed the sun did come out but only to give a discouraged look at the landscape and retire again
532,4195-17507-0029.flac,and pushed upon the carriage as if determined to dash it over the precipice as it collided against the stone wall the vehicle tipped dangerously hurling the driver from his seat to dive aheadforemost into the space beneath
533,4195-17507-0012.flac,hop in my dears they entered the crazy looking vehicle and found the seats ample and comfortable despite the appearance of dilapidation everywhere prevalent the driver mounted the box cracked his whip and the lean nags ambled away at a fair pace
534,4195-17507-0015.flac,this rig is all right uncle it may not be as pretty as the other but i expect that one is only kept to make engagements with when it comes to actual use we don't get it that's true enough he returned
535,4195-17507-0031.flac,while the carriage lay wedged against the wall and the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway between sea and sky
536,4195-17507-0025.flac,and on the other side of the road the cliffs continued to ascend a like distance towards the sky
537,4195-17507-0042.flac,the wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen and as they passed through positano which is four hundred feet high
538,4195-17507-0034.flac,the adventure was accomplished and the peril was past and all was well again uncle john leaped from the carriage followed by louise and patsy
539,4195-17507-0014.flac,we've been swindled my dears he said swindled most beautifully but i suppose we may as well make the best of it better agreed patsy
540,4195-17507-0009.flac,i must not ruin a nice dress when i work answered the man smiling unabashed but the carriage what has become of the fine carriage and the good horses sir ah it is dreadful it is horrible signor
541,4195-17507-0044.flac,now a hotel much favored by the tourist count ferralti promised to join them later and rode on into town to find a surgeon to look after his injured hand while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a zigzag fashion up to the old monastery
542,4195-17507-0024.flac,rising straight from the sea which the highway overhangs at an average height of five hundred feet the traveller being protected only by a low stone parapet from the vast gulf that yawns beneath
543,4195-17507-0021.flac,italy is beautiful it is charming and delightful but seldom is this true in winter or early spring the horses went along at a spanking pace that was astonishing they passed through the picturesque lanes of serrento climbed
544,4195-17507-0008.flac,they had an early breakfast and were ready at nine o'clock but when they came to the gate of the garden they found only a dilapidated carriage standing before it do you know where my rig is
545,4195-186238-0016.flac,danny reeve's restaurant a block away patsy was standing in the doorway anxiously watching for him oh uncle john she cried as he strolled i've been really worried about you it's such a big city and you're a stranger
546,4195-186238-0001.flac,to pass the time he turned into a small restaurant and had coffee and a plate of cakes in spite of the fact that patsy had so recently prepared coffee over the sheet iron stove and bought some hot buns from a nearby bakery he was not especially hungry but in sipping the coffee and nibbling the cakes
547,4195-186238-0007.flac,the official hesitated and glance at the little man's seedy garb and countryfied air but something in the angry glance of the shrewd eye made him fear he had made a mistake he opened the small door and disappeared
548,4195-186238-0006.flac,he's busy mornings has to look over the mail he can't see you yet well he will see me and right away tell him john merrick is here your card sir i haven't any my name will do
549,4195-186238-0003.flac,another hour was spent in looking in at the shop windows then suddenly noting the time uncle john started down the street at a swinging pace and presently paused before a building upon which was a sign reading isham
550,4195-186238-0021.flac,more than enough sir i'm getting old and can't earn as much as a younger man but i'm pretty tough and mean to hold on to that twelve a week as long as possible what pay do you get patsy asked uncle john almost as much as daddy
551,4195-186238-0013.flac,but he didn't go away quietly you may be sure mister marvin and mister isham both escorted their famous client to the door
552,4195-186238-0010.flac,uncle john had been advised by patsy where to go for a good cheap luncheon but he did not heed her admonition instead he rode in a carriage beside the banker to a splendid club where he was served with the finest dishes the cheff could provide on short notice
553,4195-186238-0009.flac,a great surprise and pleasure sir thomas i'm engaged thi slass was directed at the head of the amazed porter who as the door slammed in his face nodded solemnly and remarked
554,4195-186238-0025.flac,exceedingly you must be nearly bankrupt by this time said patsy on tuesday evening it's an expensive city to live in sighed uncle john
555,4195-186238-0000.flac,chapter twenty five uncle john acts queerly
556,4195-186238-0002.flac,he passed the best part of an hour he smiled when he paid out twenty five cents of his slender store for the refreshment with five cents for the carfare he had now but twelve cents left of the forty two patsy had given him
557,4195-186238-0027.flac,and we sleep till eight o'clock don't we patsy asked the major of course and the eggs for breakfast ive bought them all ready three for a nickel you don't care for more than one do you uncle john no my dear
558,4195-186238-0011.flac,moreover mister marvin introduced him to several substantial gentlemen as mister john merrick of portlan and each one bowed profoundly and declared he was highly honored yet uncle john seemed in no way elated by this reception
559,4195-186238-0022.flac,we're dreadfully rich uncle john so you needn't worry if you don't strike a job yourself all at once any luck to day sir asked the major tucking a napkin under his chin and beginning on the soup uncle john shook his head of course not said patsy quickly it's too early as yet
560,4195-186238-0019.flac,they missed me at the office and were glad to have me back
561,4195-186238-0026.flac,your expenses are nothing at all declared the major with a wave of his hand but my dinner's at danny reeves place must cost a lot protested uncle john
562,4195-186238-0008.flac,in a moment the door burst open to a low egress to a big red bearded man in his shirt sleeves who glanced around briefly and then rushed at uncle john and shook both his hands cordially
563,4195-186238-0023.flac,don't hurry uncle john except that it'll keep you busy there's no need for you to work at all you're older than i am suggested the major and that makes it harder to break in but there's no hurry as patsy says uncle john did not seem to be worrying over his idleness
564,4195-186238-0020.flac,i've got a raise really said uncle john seeing it was expected of him for a fact it's patsy's doing i've no doubt she wheedled the firm into giving me a vacation and now they're to pay me twelve a week instead of ten is that enough asked uncle john doubtfully
565,4195-186238-0012.flac,and he talked with easy familiarity of preferred stocks and amalgated interest and invested and securities in many other queer things that the banker seemed to understand fully and to listen to with respectful deference
566,4195-186238-0014.flac,in a moment the great broadway crowd had swallowed up john merrick and five minutes later he was thoughtfully gazing into a shop window again by and by he bethought himself of the time and took a cab up down
567,4195-186238-0017.flac,i'm sorry he said humbly but it's a long way here from downtown didn't you take a car no my dear why you foolish old uncle come in at once
568,4195-186238-0015.flac,beside the check book which was carefully hidden away in an inside pocket so the cost of the cab did not worry him
569,4195-186238-0024.flac,and issued a string of orders in a voice not nearly so meek and mild as it was when he was in patsy's presence
570,4195-186238-0005.flac,another hour passed presently uncle john jumped up and approached the official hasn't mister marvin arrived yet he inquired sharply an hour ago was the reply then why didn't you let me know i want to see him
571,4195-186238-0018.flac,the major has been terribly excited over you and swore you should not be allowed to wander through the streets without some one to look after you but what could we do i'm all right declared uncle john cordially shaking hands with patsy's father have you had a good day fine said the major
572,4195-186238-0004.flac,uncle john walked in although the uniformed official at the door eyed him suspiciously mister marvin in he inquired pleasantly not arrived yet said the official who wore a big star upon his breast i'll wait announced uncle john and sat down upon a leather covered bench
573,4195-186236-0018.flac,nor think even clearly as yet patsy tried to comfort beth never mind dear said she we're no worse off than before we came are we and we've had a nice vacation
574,4195-186236-0027.flac,the lawyer who had consented to stay at the mansion for a time
575,4195-186236-0020.flac,i'm wondering that myself said the little man meekly
576,4195-186236-0017.flac,it's all i'll ever get it seems and then the thought of the professor and his debts overcame her and she burst into tears the boy sat doubled within his chair so overcome by the extraordinary fortune that had overtaken him that he could not speak
577,4195-186236-0014.flac,good by to my five thousand said uncle john with his chuckling laugh but i'm much obliged to jane nevertheless don't we get anything at all asked beth with quivering lip no my dear answered the lawyer gently your aunt owned nothing to give you
578,4195-186236-0026.flac,and he said he hoped to see all the girls again
579,4195-186236-0002.flac,but there were few tears shed for jane merrick and the new regime could not fail to be an improvement over the last
580,4195-186236-0009.flac,lawyer watson and uncle john were there looking as grave as the important occasion demanded
581,4195-186236-0007.flac,to offend her altogether they were all better provided for than they had feared would be the case so the little party spent a pleasant evening and separated early beth and louise to go to their rooms and canvass quietly the events of the day
582,4195-186236-0000.flac,chapter twenty three patsy adopts an uncle uncle john and mister watson did not appear at dinner being closeted in the former's room
583,4195-186236-0028.flac,that may be answered the boy
584,4195-186236-0021.flac,no replied uncle john the merricks are out of elmhurst now and it returns to its rightful owners you owe me nothing my lad
585,4195-186236-0008.flac,and then she went to bed and slept peacefully
586,4195-186236-0001.flac,being served by the old servants as a mere matter of routine indeed the arrangements of the household had been considerably changed by the death of its mistress and without any real head to direct them the servants were patiently waiting the advent of a new master or mistress
587,4195-186236-0004.flac,when alone with the three cousins protested that it would not be right for patsy to give him all the estate but as she was so generous he would accept enough of his uncle tom's money to educate him as an artist and provide for himself an humble home
588,4195-186236-0012.flac,of the estate during her lifetime
589,4195-186236-0016.flac,louise smiled it was all a great farce she said i shall take the afternoon train to the city what an old fraud our dear aunt jane was and how foolish of me to return her hundred dollar check i used mine said beth bitterly
590,4195-186236-0022.flac,louise smiled rather scornfully and bet scowled my mother and i live so simply in our little flat said one thut we really haven't any extra room to keep a cat but we shall be glad to assist uncle john as far as we are able
591,4195-186236-0010.flac,and the subsequent finding of the will
592,4195-186236-0006.flac,the balance of power seemed to be in patricia's hands however
593,4195-186236-0013.flac,mister bradley having provided for that most fully for this reason the will i read to you yesterday is of no effect and kenneth forbes inherits from his uncle through his mother all of the estate blank looks followed mister watson' statement
594,4195-186236-0005.flac,louise and beth having at last full knowledge of their cousin's desire to increase their bequests were openly very grateful for her good will although secretly they could not fail to resent patsy's choice of the boy as the proper heir of his uncle's fortune
595,4195-186236-0025.flac,thank you my dear said he but where's the money to come from money boh she said doesn't the major earn a heap with his book keeping and haven't i had a raise lately why we'll be as snug and contented as pigs in clover can you get ready to come with me to day uncle john
596,4195-186236-0011.flac,was made subsequent to the one under which jane merrick inherited and therefore supersedes it
597,4195-186236-0024.flac,no no say nothing at all sir come you shall if i have to drag you and if you act naughty i'll send for the major to punish you
598,4195-186236-0015.flac,patsy laughed she felt wonderfully relieved wasn't i the grand lady though with all the fortune i never had she cried merrily but twas really fine to be rich for a day and toss the money around as if i didn't have to dress ten heads of hair and ten hours to earn my bread and butter
599,4195-186236-0003.flac,but being unaware of its import gave it but passing attention the main subject of conversation was aunt jane's surprising act in annulling her last will and forcing patricia to accept the inheritance when she did not want it
600,4195-186236-0023.flac,father can hardly support his own family said the other but i will talk to my mother about uncle john when i get home and see what she says oh you don't need to indeed cried patsy in great indignation uncle john is my dear mother's brother and he's to come and live with the major and me as long as he cares to
601,4195-186236-0019.flac,i'm going home to day said beth angrily drying her eyes we'll all go home said patsy cheerfully for my part remarked uncle john in a grave voice i have no home
602,4195-186237-0009.flac,not at all daddy then don't mind it child like as not the money would be the ruination of us all as sir appealing to uncle john
603,4195-186237-0005.flac,and the old fellow rattled away with the eagerness of a boy telling every detail in the most whimsical manner and finding something humorous in every incident oh but it was grand patsy he exclaimed and the colonel wept on my neck when we parted and stained the collar of my best coat
604,4195-186237-0033.flac,you ought to be very contented sir
605,4195-186237-0003.flac,on which account said the major grasping the little man's hand most cordially i'll love uncle john like my own brother and surely he added his voice falling tenderly my dear violet's brother must be my own
606,4195-186237-0032.flac,thank you patsy said uncle john meekly and gathered up his forty two cents you've now a home and a manager sir with the money in the bank of patsy and company limited
607,4195-186237-0015.flac,the place was so plain after the comparative luxury of elmhurst and especially of the rose chamber patsy had occupied that the old man could not fail to marvel at the girl's ecstatic joy to find herself in the old tenement again
608,4195-186237-0029.flac,uncle john hesitated a moment and then drew from an inner pocket of his coat a thin wallet from this when she had received it from his hand the girl
609,4195-186237-0000.flac,chapter twenty four home again the major was at hi station to meet them
610,4195-186237-0002.flac,leaving the little man in her wake to rescue her belongings and follow after he could hardly see patsy at all the major wrapped her in such an ample embrace but by and by she escaped to get her breath and then her eyes fell upon the meek form holding her bundles
611,4195-186237-0001.flac,the girl caught sight of him outside the gates his face red and beaming as a poppy in bloom and his snowy moustache bristling with eagerness at once she dropped her bundles and flew to the major's arms
612,4195-186237-0007.flac,i fought with aunt jane like a pirate and it quite won her heart when she died she left me all she had in the world look at that now said the major wonderingly which turned out to be nothing at all continued patsy
613,4195-186237-0026.flac,and if he has the money he wants to treat every man he meets uncle john shook his head reproachfully at the major a very bad habit sir he said
614,4195-186237-0006.flac,his face grew grave but how about the money patsy dear he asked did you get nothing out of jane merrick's estate not a nickle dad twas the best joke you ever knew
615,4195-186237-0027.flac,but patsy is fast curing me and after all it's a wicked city to be carrying a fat pocket book around it as i've often observed my pocket book is not exactly fat remarked uncle john but you've money sir for i marked you squandering it on the train said patsy severely
616,4195-186237-0023.flac,but just to keep him out of mischief and busy he can't hang around all day and be happy i suppose i'll look around answered the major briskly as if such a job was the easiest thing in the world to procure and meantime
617,4195-186237-0017.flac,opening from this were two closet like rooms containing each a bed in a chair with a wash basin on a bracket shelf on the wales were a few colored prints from the sunday newspaper and one large and fine photograph of a grizzled old soldier
618,4195-186237-0013.flac,danny reeves himself came instead and made a nice little speech saying that patsy had always brought good luck to the place and this dinner was his treat to welcome her home so the major thanked him with gracious dignity and patsy kissed danny on his right cheek
619,4195-186237-0004.flac,welcome sir now and always to our little home it's modest sir but wherever patsy is the sun is sure to shine i can believe that said uncle john with a nod and a smile
620,4195-186237-0018.flac,that uncle john at once decided must represent the colonel having noted these details patsy's uncle smoothed back his stubby gray hair with the reflective and half puzzled gesture it's cozy enough my child and i thank you for my welcome said he
621,4195-186237-0030.flac,good gracious she cried delightfully all this wealth and you pleading poverty i never said i was a pauper returned uncle john complacently you couldn't and be truthful sir declared the girl why this will last for ages
622,4195-186237-0025.flac,by the bye added the major if you have any money about you which is just possible sir of course you'd better turn it over to patsy to keep and let her make you an allowance that's the way i do it's very satisfactory the major's extravagant exclaimed patsy
623,4195-186237-0021.flac,the major coughed and turned the lamp a little higher you'll find the air fine and the neighborhood respectable he said to turn the subject our modest apartments are cool in summer and warm in winter and remarkably reasonable in price
624,4195-186237-0019.flac,but may i inquire where on earth you expect to stow me in this rather limited establishment where have you no eyes then she asked in estonishment it's the finest sofa in the world uncle john and you'll sleep there like a top
625,4195-186237-0011.flac,there's danny reeve's restaurant let's get off and have our dinner now i'm as hungry as a bear so they stopped the car and descended lugging all the parcels into the little restaurant where they were piled into a chair while the proprietor and the waiters all gathered around patsy to welcome her home
626,4195-186237-0020.flac,where indeed ah i see said uncle john and you can wash in my chamber added the major with a grand air and hang your clothes on the spare hooks behind my door i haven't many said uncle john looking thoughtfully at his red bundle
627,4195-186237-0016.flac,there was one good sized living room with an ancient rag carpet partially covering the floor a sheet iron stove a sofa a table and three or four old fashioned chairs that had probably come from a second hand dealer
628,4195-186237-0031.flac,he smokes observed the major significantly bah a pipe said patsy and bull durham is only five cents a bag and a bag ought to last a week and every saturday night sir
629,4195-186237-0014.flac,it's no palace said patsy entering to throw down the bundles as soon as the major unlocked the door but there's a cricket in the hearth and it's your home uncle john as well as ours uncle john looked around curiously
630,4195-186237-0012.flac,my how her eyes sparkled she fairly danced for joy and ordered the dinner with reckless disregard of the bill ah but it's good to be back said the little bohemian gleefully the big house at elmhurst was grand and stately major but there wasn't an ounce of love in the cupboard
631,4195-186237-0024.flac,meantime said uncle john smiling at them i'll look around myself to be sure agreed the major between the two of us and patsy we ought to have no trouble at all there was a moment of thoughtful silence after this and then patsy said
632,4195-186237-0028.flac,uncle john laughed and drew his chair up to the table then he emptied his trouser pockets upon the cloth and patsy gravely separated the keys and the jackknife from the coins and proceeded to count the money seven dollars and forty two cents she announced any more
633,4195-186237-0008.flac,for another will was found made by mister thomas bradley which gave the money to his own nephew after aunt jane died did you ever wonderful said the major with a sigh so i was rich for half a day and then poor as ever it didn't hurt you did it
634,4195-186237-0010.flac,in your case it won't matter our house is yours and there's plenty and to spare thank you said uncle john his face grave but his eyes merry oh major cried patsy suddenly
635,4195-186237-0022.flac,may i smoke of course but don't spoil the lace curtains dear answered patsy mischievously
636,7511-102420-0007.flac,in the lulls of the storm i could hear the men's voices high and excited they too were up it seemed to me that the storm lasted for hours but at last it moved off up the valley the flashes grew to be a mere glimmer
637,7511-102420-0026.flac,they had heard our shot and came across to see what luck whativer is the matter with ye asked missus o'shaughnessy mister haynes told her they had heard the noise but had thought it thunder mister haynes told me that if i would cherk up
638,7511-102420-0027.flac,he would give me his elk teeth though i don't admire them they are considered valuable however his elk was a cow and they don't have as nice teeth as do bulls we had lunch and the men covered the elk with pine boughs
639,7511-102420-0004.flac,always appeale to me but there was neither wind nor rain just flash and roar before the echo died away among the hills another booming report would seem to shiver the atmosphere and set all our tinware jangling
640,7511-102420-0017.flac,arabsolutely heartless on a hunt i was scarcely through panting before we began to descend we received instructions as to how we should move so as to keep out of range of each other's guns then mister haynes and myself started one way
641,7511-102420-0028.flac,to keep the camp robbers from pecking it full of holes next day the men would come with the horses and pack it into camp we all felt refreshed so we started on the trail of those that got away
642,7511-102420-0046.flac,as if fascinated until i sent her from the table and went out to speak to her about gazing why mamma she said i had to look he has swallowed something that won't go either up or down and i'm fraid he'll choke
643,7511-102420-0009.flac,the men had to find them and as it took most of the day we had to put off our hunt we were up and about next morning in the first faint gray light while the men fed grain to the horses and saddled them we prepared a hasty breakfast
644,7511-102420-0035.flac,his eyes were startled and his shining black mane seemed to bristle i heard the report of guns and he tumbled in a confused heap he tried to rise but others coming leaped over him and knocked him down some more shots
645,7511-102420-0036.flac,and those behind turned and went back the way they had come mister haynes shouted to me shoot shoot why don't you shoot so i fired my crag but next i found myself picking myself up
646,7511-102420-0037.flac,and wondering who had struck me and for what i was so dizzy i could scarcely move but i got down to where the others were excitedly admiring the two dead elk that they said where the victims of missus o'shaughnessy's gun
647,7511-102420-0038.flac,she was as excited and delighted as if she had never declared she would not kill anything sure it's many a meal they'll make for little hungry mouth she said she was rubbing her shoulder ruefully
648,7511-102420-0021.flac,rose the red cliffs with their jagged crags at the report of the gun two huge blocks of stone almost as large as a house detached themselves and fell at the same instant one of the quaking asp groves
649,7511-102420-0039.flac,i thought old golyer had hit me a biff with a black forn chelely she remarked mister haynes turned to me and said you're a dandy hunter you didn't shoot at all until after the olk were gone
650,7511-102420-0025.flac,but the elk have to be quartered so as to load them on to a horse missus o'shaughnessy and mister struble came out of the woods just then they had seen a big bunch of elk headed by a splendid bull but got no shot and the elk went out of the pass
651,7511-102420-0030.flac,and windfall so thick that we could hardly get through we were obliged to pick our way carefully to avoid noise and we were all together not having come to a place where it seemed better to separate
652,7511-102420-0050.flac,but we have to listen to run nigger run an the old gray hoss come a tearin out the wilderness i'll sing them to you when i come to denver
653,7511-102420-0033.flac,we were all on one side and mister haynes said to me rest your gun on that rock and aim at the first rib back of the shoulder if you shoot haphazard you may cripple an elk and let it get away to die in misery so make sure when you fire
654,7511-102420-0015.flac,we could hear the roar of the gross venture as it tumbled grumblingly over its rocky bed to our right rose mile after mile of red cliffs as the last of the quaking asp leaves have fallen there were no golden groves
655,7511-102420-0044.flac,didn't know he lived up here he had seen the game warden from whom she had procured her license and so hunted up our camp he is an odd looking individual with sad eyes and a drooping mouth which gives his face a most hopeless reproachful expression
656,7511-102420-0024.flac,not an earthquake you're as white as a ghost come on up here and see my fine elk i sat on a log watching him dress his elk we have found it best not to remove the skin
657,7511-102420-0048.flac,mary ellen i have a real treat and surprise for you just wait a few minutes and i'll bet you'll be happy we took our accustomed places around the fire while mister murray hobbled his cayoose and took an odd looking bundle from the saddle
658,7511-102420-0016.flac,in their places stood silvery patches against the red background of the cliffs high overhead a triangle of wild geese harrowed the blue sky i was plumb out of breath but men who are most gallant elsewhere
659,7511-102420-0013.flac,the sun was well up when we reached the little park where we picketed our horses then came a long hard climb it is hard climbing it the best and when there is a big gun to carry it is very hard
660,7511-102420-0005.flac,we are camped so near the great pines that i will confess i was powerfully afraid had the lightning struck one of the big pines there would not have been one of us left i could hear missus o'shaughnessy murmuring her prayers when there was a lull
661,7511-102420-0041.flac,supper was ready but i went to bed at once they all thought it was because i was so disappointed but it was because i was so stiff and sore i could hardly move and so tired i couldn't sleep next morning my jaw and neck were so swollen
662,7511-102420-0010.flac,we were off before it was more than light enough for us to see the trail dawn in the mountains how i wish i could describe it to you if i could only make you feel the keen bracing air the exhilarating climb
663,7511-102420-0031.flac,we had about resolved to go to our horses when we heard a volley of shots that is somebody bunch shooting said mister struble they are in brewster lake park by the sound that means that the yelk will pass here in a short time and we may get a shot
664,7511-102420-0006.flac,we had gone to bed but i couldn't remain there so i sat on the wagon seat with jerine beside me something struck the guyropes of the tent and i was so frightened i was too weak to cry out i thought the big tree must have fallen
665,7511-102420-0034.flac,it didn't seem a minute before we heard the beat of their hoofs and a queer panting noise that i can't describe first came a beautiful thing with his head held high
666,7511-102420-0001.flac,i haven't one thing i told her i owed you more love than i could ever pay in a lifetime and she said writing such long letters is a mighty poor way to show it i have been neglecting you shamefully i think
667,7511-102420-0000.flac,camp cloudcrest october sixth nineteen fourteen dear missus coney it seems so odd to be writing you and getting no answers
668,7511-102420-0003.flac,flash after flash of the most blinding lightning followed by deafening peals of thunder and as it echoed from mountain to mountain the uproar was terrifying i have always loved a storm the bead of hail and rain and the roar of wind
669,7511-102420-0014.flac,then too we had to keep up with the men and we didn't find that easy to do at last we reached the top and sat down on some boulders to rest a few minutes before we started down to the hunting ground which lay in a cup like valley far below us
670,7511-102420-0043.flac,and go back empty handed and partly to get a rest from mister murry's everlasting accordion mister murray is an old time acquaintance of missus o'shaughnessy's he has a ranch down on the river somewhere missus o'shaughnessy has not seen him for years
671,7511-102420-0008.flac,and the thunder mere rumbling the pines began to moan and soon a little breeze whistled by so we lay down again next morning the horses could not be found the storm had frightened them and they had tried to go home
672,7511-102420-0020.flac,but i stood still fascinated by what i saw our side of the valley was bounded by a rim of rock over the rim was a sheer wall of rock for two hundred feet to where the gross venture was angrily roaring below on the other side of the stream
673,7511-102420-0012.flac,even at this season but here there are no song birds and only the snapping of twigs as our horses climbed the frosty trail broke the silence we had been cautioned not to talk but neither missus o'shaughnessy nor i wanted to
674,7511-102420-0049.flac,he seated himself and took from the bundle an accordion he set it upon his knee and began pulling and pushing on it he did what mister struble said was doling a doleful tune everyone took it good naturedly
675,7511-102420-0029.flac,for a while walking was easy and we made pretty good time then we had a rocky hill to get over we had to use care when we got into the timber there were marshy places which tried us sorely
676,7511-102420-0018.flac,and mister struble and missus o'shaughnessy the other we were to meet where the valley terminated in a broad pass we felt sure we could get a chance at what elk there might be in the valley we were following fresh tracks and a little of the hunter's enthusiasm seized me
677,7511-102420-0002.flac,one of the main reasons i came on this hunt was to take the trip for you and to tell you things that you would most enjoy so i will spend this snowy day in writing to you on the night of september thirtieth there was the most awful thunder storm i ever witnessed
678,7511-102420-0042.flac,that i hated any one to see me and my head ached for two days it has been snowing for a long time but klyde says he will take me hunting when it stops
679,7511-102420-0022.flac,began to move slowly i couldn't believe my eyes i shut them a moment but when i looked the grove was moving faster it slid swiftly and i could plainly hear the rattle of stones falling against stones until with a muffled roar
680,7511-102420-0040.flac,and the way you held your gun it is a wonder you didn't knock your head off instead of just smashing your jaw the men worked as fast as they could at the elk and we helped as much as we could but it was dark before we reached camp
681,7511-102420-0032.flac,the olk will be here long before the men since the men have no horses so let's hurry and get placed along the only place they can get out we'll get our limit we hastily secreted ourselves along the narrow gorge through which the elk must pass
682,7511-102420-0023.flac,the whole hillside fell into the stream mister haynes came running back what's the matter are you hurt why didn't you shoot he asked i waved my hand weakly toward where the great mound of tangled trees and earth blocked the water
683,7511-102420-0045.flac,his nose however seems to upset the original plan for it is long and thin and bent slightly to one side his neck is long and his adom's apple seems uncertain as to where it belongs at supper gerine watched it
684,7511-102420-0019.flac,we had not followed them far when three cows and a spike came running out of the pines a little ahead of us instantly mister haynes's gun flew to his shoulder and a deafening report jarred our ears he ran forward
685,7511-102420-0011.flac,greenish amber light and a blue gray sky far ahead of us we could see the red rimrock of a mountain above timber line the first rays of the sun turned the jagged peaks into golden points of a crown in oklahoma
686,7511-102420-0047.flac,although i can't brag about mister murray's appearance i can about his taste for he admires missus o'shaughnessy it seems that in years gone by he has made attempts to marry her as he got up from supper the first night he was with us he said
687,7511-102419-0033.flac,while they were gone we helped elizabeth to dress all the while missus o'shaughnessy was admonishing her to name her first geirl mary ellen or she said
688,7511-102419-0031.flac,we had just got the coffee boiling when the lovers came up elizabeth in the saddle learning to ride and he walking beside her holding her hand how happy they were the rest of us were mighty near as foolish as they
689,7511-102419-0026.flac,mister stewart said we might as well noon as soon as we came to a good place and then he would ride across and see mister white just as we rounded the hill a horseman came toward us a splendid fellow he was
690,7511-102419-0009.flac,and i never saw such people you are just like your country you have fed me cared for me and befriended me a stranger
691,7511-102419-0001.flac,but i've a chance to day so i will not let it pass unused we are in the last camp right on the hunting ground in the midst of the fray we have said good bye to dear elizabeth and i must tell you about her because she really comes first
692,7511-102419-0044.flac,there is plenty of wood water and feed and looking eastward down the valley snow covered cragg topped mountains delight the eye the air is so bracing that we all feel equal to anything
693,7511-102419-0029.flac,instead of letting me enjoy the tableau he solemnly drove on saying he would not want anyone gauking at him if he were the happy man anyway he couldn't urge chub fast enough to prevent my seeing and hearing what i've told you
694,7511-102419-0042.flac,our tents are set under some big trees on a small plateau and right below us is a valley in which grass grows knee high and little streams come from every way trout scurry up stream whenever we go near
695,7511-102419-0038.flac,and i could hear her imploring all the saints to preserve us from instant death i kept shutting my eyes trying not to see the terrifying places and opening them again to see the beauty spread everywhere until mister stewart said
696,7511-102419-0027.flac,manly strength and grace showing in every line the road was narrow against the hillside and he had to ride quite close so i saw his handsome face plainly as soon as he saw elizabeth he sprang from his saddle and said eliz'beth liz'beth
697,7511-102419-0055.flac,and are all willing to help i don't think i shall be able to tell you of any great exploits i make with the gun i fired one that mister stewart carries and it almost kicked my shoulder off i am mystified about missus o'shaughnessy's license
698,7511-102419-0006.flac,there were many small lakes and the ducks and geese were noisily enjoying themselves among the rushes and water grasses beyond the river rose the forest covered mountains hill upon hill elizabeth dressed with especial care that morning
699,7511-102419-0015.flac,eighteen months ago father died gently went to sleep i waited six months and then wrote to wallace but received no reply
700,7511-102419-0017.flac,supposing it's married your man is wallace may have changed his mind about me but he would not marry without telling me if he is alive he is honorable then i asked
701,7511-102419-0053.flac,he looks to be about forty years old but whoops and laughs like he was about ten i don't need to tell you of the good mon do i he is just the kind quiet good mon that he has always been since i have known him
702,7511-102419-0018.flac,if he is stationed in the bridge's reserve they would be sure to know of him at any of these little places i just didn't have the courage to i should never have told you what i have only i think i owe it to you and it was easier because of the holts
703,7511-102419-0021.flac,to inspect our license and to tell us about our privileges and our duties as good woodsmen he also issues licenses in case hunters have neglected to secure them before coming missus o'shaughnessy had refused to get a license when we did
704,7511-102419-0014.flac,i could take care of father and teach also we were very comfortably situated and in time became really happy although i seldom heard from wallace his letters were well worth waiting for and i knew he was doing well
705,7511-102419-0054.flac,he told mister haynes he was too tam seekin de bell so we had to come without him
706,7511-102419-0050.flac,as he had heard they were fine eating having strata of fat alternating with strata of lean mister haynes is a quiet fellow just interested in hunting mister struble is the big man of the party
707,7511-102419-0019.flac,i am so glad we met them so we drove along talking together we each assured the girl of our entire willingness to have her as a member of the family after a while i got on to the wagon with mister steart and told him elizabeth's story
708,7511-102419-0040.flac,from there the hunters would ride horseback as far up as they could and then climb it was almost sundown when we reached camp all the hunters were in and such a yelling as they set up
709,7511-102419-0045.flac,mister struble has already killed a fine spike elk for camp eating we camped in a bunch and we have camp stoves so that in case of rain or snow we can stay indoors just now we have a huge camp fire
710,7511-102419-0030.flac,besides that i saw that elizabeth's hat was on a ry her hair in disorder and her eyes red it was disappointing after she had been so careful to look nicely missus o'shaughnessy came trotting along and we stopped for dinner
711,7511-102419-0039.flac,it must make you nervous to ride over mountain roads don't bat your eyes so fast and you'll see more so then i stiffened my back and kept my eyes open and i did see more it had been decided to go as far as we could with the wagons and then set camp
712,7511-102419-0007.flac,and very pretty she looked in her neat shepherd's plaid suit and natty little white canvas hat very soon she said i hope neither of you will misunderstand me when i tell you that if my hopes are realized i will not ride with you much longer
713,7511-102419-0034.flac,which was me name before i was married to me man god rest his soul dear elizabeth she was glad to get away i suspect she and her wallace made a fine couple as they rode away in the golden september afternoon
714,7511-102419-0052.flac,not to mention carrying the heavy gun they are using the largest calibre sporting guns murderous looking things that is all except mister hark rudder the picture man
715,7511-102419-0047.flac,but they are delicious yesterday we had pie made of wild currants there are a powerful lot of them here there is also a little blueberry that the men say is the rocky mountain huckleberry the grouse are feeding on them
716,7511-102419-0012.flac,before i was through school i was to have been married but i lost my mother just then and was left the care of my paralytic father if i had married then i should have had to take father from his familiar surroundings because wallace came west in the forestry service
717,7511-102419-0016.flac,i could bear it no longer and have come to see what has become of him if he is dead may i stay on with one of you and perhaps get a school i want to live here always but darlint said missus o'shaughnessy
718,7511-102419-0041.flac,look who's here see who's come they yelled they went to work setting up tents and unloading wagons with a hearty good will we are camped just on the edge of the pines back of us rises a big pine clad mountain
719,7511-102419-0056.flac,i know she would not shoot one of those big guns for a dozen elk besides that she is very tender hearted and will never harm anything herself although she likes to join our hunts i think you must be tired of this letter so i am going to say good night my friend
720,7511-102419-0037.flac,but as the whole way was carpeted by strawberry vines and there were late berries to tempt me to loiter i had to stay on the wagon i had no idea a wagon could be got across such places mister struble drove for missus o'shaughnessy
721,7511-102419-0051.flac,he is tall and strong and we find him very pleasant company then there is doctor teshall he is a quiet fellow with an unexpected smile he is so reserved that i felt that he was kind of out of place among the rest until i caught his cordial smile
722,7511-102419-0043.flac,we call the valley paradise valley because it is the horses paradise and as in the early morning we can often see clouds rolling along the valley we call our camp cloud crust we have a beautiful place it is well sheltered
723,7511-102419-0004.flac,the mountains on one side were crested great crags and piles of rock crowned them as far as we could see timber grew only about half way up the trunks of the quaking aspens shone silvery in the early sunlight and their leaves were shimmering gold
724,7511-102419-0005.flac,and the stately pines kept whispering and murmuring it almost seemed as if they were chiding the quaking aspens for being frivolous on the other side of the road lay the river bordered by willows and grassy flats
725,7511-102419-0013.flac,i felt that it wouldn't be right poor father couldn't speak but his eyes told me how grateful he was to stay we had our little home and father had his pension and i was able to get a small school near us
726,7511-102419-0003.flac,the sky was clear blue
727,7511-102419-0022.flac,she said she was not going to hunt she told us we could give her a small piece of ilk and that would do so we were rather surprised when she purchased two licenses one aspecial which would entitle her to a bull elk
728,7511-102419-0035.flac,i believe she is one happy bride that the sun shone on if the omen has failed everywhere else well we felt powerfully reduced in numbers but about three o'clock that afternoon we came upon mister struble and mister haynes
729,7511-102419-0010.flac,missus o'shaughnessy said tut tut tis nothing at all we've done tis a comfort you've been hasn't she missus stewart i could heartily agree and elizabeth went on the way i've been received and the way we all treated missus holt
730,7511-102419-0025.flac,and was trying to quiet her the road along there was very rough staying on the wagon occupied all my attention for a while several miles were past when we came in sight of a beautiful cabin half hidden in a grove of pines beyond the river
731,7511-102419-0028.flac,she held her hands to him and said oh just riding with friends then to missus o'shaughnessy she said this is my wallace mister stewart is the queerest man
732,7511-102419-0008.flac,i never saw such a country as the west
733,7511-102419-0000.flac,camp cloudcrest september twelfth nineteen fourteen dear missus coney
734,7511-102419-0024.flac,happiness had taken a new clutch upon my heart i looked back expecting to see elizabeth all smiles but if you will believe me the foolish girl was sobbing as if her heart was broken missus o'shaughnessy drew her head down upon her shoulder
735,7511-102419-0002.flac,to begin with the morning we left the holts elizabeth suggested that we three women ride in the buckboard so i seated myself on a roll of bedding in the back part
736,7511-102419-0049.flac,when they see elk every day it is a great temptation to try a shot one of the students told me professor glenholdt was here to get the tip end bone of the tail of a bronta saurus
737,7511-102419-0046.flac,around which we sit in the evening telling stories singing and eating nuts of the pinon pine then too the whole country is filled with those tiny little strawberries we have to gather all day to get as much as we can eat
738,7511-102419-0023.flac,as we were starting mister stewart asked the game warden can you tell me if wallace white is still stationed here oh yes mister sorenson said wallace's place is only a few miles up the river and can be plainly seen from the road we drove on
739,7511-102419-0032.flac,they were going to start immediately after dinner on horseback for the county seat to be married after we had eaten elizabeth selected a few things from her trunk and mister stewart and mister white drove the buckboard across the river to leave the trunk in its new home
740,7511-102419-0048.flac,altogether this is one of the most delightful places imaginable the men are not very anxious to begin hunting a little delay means cooler weather for the meat it is cool up here but going back across the desert it will be warm for a while yet still
741,7511-102419-0036.flac,waiting beside the road for us they had come to pilot us into camp for there would be no road soon such a way as we came over such jolting and sliding i begged to get off and walk
742,7511-102419-0020.flac,and we held our breath until we emerged on the other side mister sorenson is a very capable and conscientious game warden and a very genial gentleman he rode down to meet us
743,7511-102419-0011.flac,will be the greatest help to me in becoming what i hope to become a real westerner i might have lived a long time in the west and not have understood many things if i had not fallen into your hands years ago
744,1898-145715-0049.flac,he was just about to present her to his mother and the court
745,1898-145715-0011.flac,had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years that she had imprisoned him in the palace where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time but now he owned
746,1898-145715-0018.flac,she took the bird's advice and in due time arrived at the house of lacrinos luckily she only found his wife at home who was much struck by the princes's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners
747,1898-145715-0038.flac,fairer than a fairy thanked her warmly and resumed her way cheered by pleasant thoughts after a time her road led through a wood full of soft airs and sweet odours and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle
748,1898-145715-0014.flac,lagree on her return soon found out the neglect and seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner
749,1898-145715-0020.flac,convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain and fairer than a fairy carried out his plan daily with entire success every morning she placed a large basin ful of water on her window sill and as soon as the sun's rays fell on the water
750,1898-145715-0050.flac,charms would win all hearts when the three green and white sisters appeared they declared the secret of fairer than a fairy's royal birth and the queen taking the two lovers in her carriage set off with them for the capital of the kingdom
751,1898-145715-0043.flac,who now saw him for the first time in his real shape
752,1898-145715-0003.flac,she was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or ill natured tricks of the whole body of fairies with her large experience added to her native spite
753,1898-145715-0042.flac,she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire castle and which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling
754,1898-145715-0034.flac,she gave her a nut desiring her only to open it in the most urgent need after a long and tiring journey fairer than a fairy was once more received in a house and by a lady exactly like the one she
755,1898-145715-0005.flac,at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate she then gave two glass bottles into the princess's charge desiring her to take the greatest care of them
756,1898-145715-0040.flac,that the moment had come in which to use the nut which had been given her she opened it and out came a diminutive hall porter
757,1898-145715-0021.flac,the rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain by this means they were able to meet without losing sight of the fire or of the two bottles in which the old fairy kept her eye and her tooth at night
758,1898-145715-0008.flac,she noticed that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow she stood still to admire it when to her great surprise she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays
759,1898-145715-0039.flac,fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows she had no doubt though really i cannot think why
760,1898-145715-0045.flac,the prince was not completely roused but he opened his eyes a little and looked all the handsomer impatient at not being recognized fairer than a fairy now drew out her third present and on opening the crystal scent bottle a little siren flew out
761,1898-145715-0035.flac,here again she received a present with the same injunctions
762,1898-145715-0019.flac,she readily let fairer than a fairy have the fire
763,1898-145715-0016.flac,and eating any young girls our heroine obeyed with great sweetness and without having been able to take leave of her lover
764,1898-145715-0031.flac,she flew at lagree's face and tore out her only eye thus delivering the princess for ever from her persecutor
765,1898-145715-0046.flac,at the same moment the walls of the room expanded and opened out revealing a golden throne covered with jewels
766,1898-145715-0006.flac,and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience she vanished leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace
767,1898-145715-0001.flac,than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it and either to torment her cruelly or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men the eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge this fairy was named lagree
768,1898-145715-0024.flac,fairer than a fairy eagerly ran to the window but in her haste she upset the basin and spilt all the water with which she had carefully filled it overnight no other water was at hand except that in the two bottles
769,1898-145715-0041.flac,you ever saw the princess climbed up one of the silver chains holding in her hand the little porter who in spite of his minute size opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in
770,1898-145715-0010.flac,the beautiful rainbow informed fairer than a fairy that he was young the son of a powerful king and that the fairy lagree who owed his parents a grudge
771,1898-145715-0023.flac,the poor young couple were in despair and only parted with the last ray of sunshine and in hopes of meeting next morning alas next day was dark and gloomy and it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes
772,1898-145715-0027.flac,the princess on her side vowed to have no other husband and declared herself willing to brave death itself in order to rejoin him they were not allowed much time for their adieus the rainbow vanished and the princess resolved to run all risks
773,1898-145715-0009.flac,the voice was that of a young man and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming but this had to be a mere matter of fancy for no one was visible
774,1898-145715-0033.flac,which stood at no great distance here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white to match the house which apparently belonged to her and of which she seemed the only inhabitant
775,1898-145715-0032.flac,but no sooner had lagree been put to fight than our heroine was overwhelmed with hunger and thirst she felt as though she should certainly expire and it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as far
776,1898-145715-0007.flac,several years passed during which time the princess grew accustomed to her lonely life obeyed the fairy's orders and by degrees forgot all about the court of the king her father
777,1898-145715-0036.flac,that they wished their houses and garments to be equally alike their occupation consisted in helping those in misfortune and they were as gentle and benevolent as lagree had been cruel and spiteful the third fairy comforted the poor traveller
778,1898-145715-0037.flac,begged her not to lose heart and assured her that her troubles should be rewarded she accompanied her advice by the gift of a crystal smelling bottle with strict orders only to open in case of urgent need
779,1898-145715-0025.flac,it was the only chance of seeing her lover before they were separated and she did not hesitate to bring the bottle and pour their contents into the basin when the rainbow appeared at once their farewells were full of tenderness
780,1898-145715-0000.flac,once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage at length having granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as fairer than a fairy
781,1898-145715-0044.flac,on opening it found that all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof and at once began playing melodiously
782,1898-145715-0017.flac,as to certain death as she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by and to use it when needed
783,1898-145715-0004.flac,she felt a little reassured and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her
784,1898-145715-0002.flac,she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left
785,1898-145715-0022.flac,and for some time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe he had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot but he had no idea where he was to go
786,1898-145715-0047.flac,in the first and most splendid of these carriages sat prince rainbow's mother she fondly embraced her son after which she informed him that his father had been dead for some years that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased
787,1898-145715-0048.flac,and that he might return in peace to reign over his people who were longing for his presence the court received the new king with joyful acclamations which would have delighted him at any other time
788,1898-145715-0028.flac,started off at once taking nothing with her but her dog her cat a sprig of myrtle and the stone which the wife of lucrinos gave her when lagree became aware of her prisoner's flight
789,1898-145715-0015.flac,for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out now this locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured every one he came across and especially enjoyed a chance of catching
790,1898-145715-0026.flac,the prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations and promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dearer fairer than a fairy from her captivity and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free
791,1898-145715-0013.flac,could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves
792,1898-145715-0012.flac,he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairer than a fairy he added many other tender speeches to this declaration and the princess to whom such remarks were a new experience
793,1898-145715-0029.flac,as she did so the sprig of myrtle she carried touched the ground and immediately a green and shady bower sprang up around her in which she hoped to sleep in peace but lagree had not given up her pursuit
794,1898-145715-0030.flac,and arrived just as fairer than a fairy had fallen fast asleep this time she made sure of catching her victim but the cat spied her out
795,1898-145724-0033.flac,and determine to lay siege to the flower queen's palace but the queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling through which no one could force away
796,1898-145724-0037.flac,and lasted till the approach of winter when the flower queen's daughter went back again to her mother
797,1898-145724-0034.flac,when the flower queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the prince she said to him i will give my consent to your marriage gladly but my daughter can only stay with you in summer in winter when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow
798,1898-145724-0007.flac,and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home
799,1898-145724-0014.flac,would like to enter her service this flattering speech pleased the dragons and the eldest of them said well you may come with me and i will take you to the mother dragon
800,1898-145724-0018.flac,we will eat you up the prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow
801,1898-145724-0036.flac,when the flower queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother
802,1898-145724-0017.flac,very well
803,1898-145724-0008.flac,and his horse had died of exhaustion while he himself had suffered much from want and misery but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of at last one day he came to a hut in front of which sat a very old man
804,1898-145724-0029.flac,in a moment the king of the fishes appeared and said to him i know quite well what you want me to do and i will summon all the fishes of the sea together
805,1898-145724-0020.flac,and taking it out of his pocket he rang at once in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him and the king of the eagles sank at his feet
806,1898-145724-0030.flac,she said to him you are a brave youth and i will make you my body servant but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with
807,1898-145724-0026.flac,the ball came to an end at midnight and early next morning the prince again led the mother dragon's mare out into the meadow but again she vanished before his eyes then he took out his little bell and rang it twice
808,1898-145724-0019.flac,and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate as he sat thus lost in thought he noticed an eagle flying over his head then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell
809,1898-145724-0011.flac,he asked him the same question and the old man answered no
810,1898-145724-0027.flac,and again she led him to the ball room the flower queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear if you succeed again to morrow wait for me with the foal in the meadow
811,1898-145724-0004.flac,which deserves to be rewarded would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife most certainly i would replied the prince so the old woman continued
812,1898-145724-0023.flac,who was full of wonder when she saw him and said
813,1898-145724-0006.flac,the king of the eagles will appear if you ring it twice the king of the foxes will come to you and if you ring it three times you will see the king of the fishes by your side
814,1898-145724-0032.flac,the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queen's dwelling but the dragons had noticed their flight and woke their brother out of his year's sleep he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened
815,1898-145724-0031.flac,the prince begged for a foal of the mare which the mother dragon at once gave him and over and above a cloak made of gold for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak
816,1898-145724-0002.flac,over there at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance replied the old woman the prince lifted her on to his horse and soon they reached the hut where the old woman got down and turning to the prince said
817,1898-145724-0000.flac,to his astonishment he found an old woman who begged him to help her out of the ditch the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there my son
818,1898-145724-0003.flac,just wait a moment and i will give you something and she disappeared into her hut but returned very soon and said you are a mighty prince but at the same
819,1898-145724-0016.flac,and added to it all she had three heads her appearance was a great shock to the prince and so was her voice which was like the croaking of many ravens she asked him
820,1898-145724-0028.flac,after the ball we will fly away together on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again but once more she vanished before his eyes then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times
821,1898-145724-0035.flac,she must come and live with me in my palace underground the prince consented to this and led his beautiful bride home where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence the young couple lived happily together till winter came
822,1898-145724-0015.flac,they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls all made of gold and diamonds in the twelfth room they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond throne she was the
823,1898-145724-0021.flac,the bird said you are looking for the mother dragon's mare who is galloping about among the clouds i will summon all the eagles of the air together and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you and with these words the king of the eagles flew away
824,1898-145724-0022.flac,towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them they sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon
825,1898-145724-0025.flac,here too was the flower queen's beautiful daughter her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world and her complexion was like lilies and roses as the prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear
826,1898-145724-0012.flac,with diamond windows he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard
827,1898-145724-0013.flac,when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted the prince replied
828,1898-145724-0005.flac,who has been captured by a dragon if you wish to marry her you must first set her free and this i will help you to do i will give you this little bell if you ring it once
829,1898-145724-0010.flac,the prince thanked him for his information and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road and at the end of it came to the little hut where he found a very old man
830,1898-145724-0001.flac,answered the old woman i am a very poor woman and soon after midnight i set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning but i lost my way in the dark
831,1898-145724-0009.flac,no i do not answered the old man
832,1898-145724-0024.flac,she gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper
833,1898-145702-0016.flac,pointing at the signatures said i will take you underground with me you shall have a meal there if you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat you shall be free
834,1898-145702-0010.flac,if you would help yourselves one of you must go into the wood and there he will come upon a tumble down building of rocks which looks like a little house he must go in and there he will find help the two melancholy ones thought
835,1898-145702-0019.flac,do you know what your wineglass shall be an old horse's hoof shall be our wineglass
836,1898-145702-0007.flac,they went into a field sat down and the two pulled long faces an old woman passed by and asked them why they were so sad
837,1898-145702-0009.flac,and how he had given them money as plentifully as blackberries but as they had signed their names they were his unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle the old woman said
838,1898-145702-0015.flac,and how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle then they were all delighted and in high spirits took out their whip and cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground when the seven years had quite gone the fiend came with his book and
839,1898-145702-0005.flac,then he put a book before them which he made all three of them sign i will then give you a riddle he said if you guess it you shall be free and out of my power the dragon then flew away
840,1898-145702-0014.flac,i know enough and can help myself splendidly then he went by another way through the window secretly and in all haste back to his comrades he told them how the dragon had been outwitted by his grandmother
841,1898-145702-0000.flac,one of them said to the others if we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows how shall we set about it the other said do you see that large corn field there
842,1898-145702-0001.flac,if we were to hide ourselves in that no one could find us the army cannot come into it and to morrow it is to march on they crept into the corn but the army did not march on but remained encamped close around them
843,1898-145702-0011.flac,that won't save us and they remained where they were but the third and merryone jumped up and went into the wood till he found the rock hut in the hut sat a very old woman who was the dragon's grandmother
844,1898-145702-0013.flac,i will tell you this in the north sea lies a dead sea cat that shall be their roast meat and the rib of a whale that shall be their silver spoon and the hollow foot of a dead horse that shall be their wineglass
845,1898-145702-0002.flac,they sat for two days and two nights in the corn and grew so hungry that they nearly died but if they were to venture out it was certain death they said at last
846,1898-145702-0017.flac,then said the first soldier
847,1898-145702-0012.flac,she asked him how he came and what was his business there he told her all that happened and because she was pleased with him she took compassion on him
848,1898-145702-0006.flac,and they journeyed on with their little whip they had as much money as they wanted wore grand clothes and made their way into the world wherever they went they lived in merry making and splendor drove about with horses and carriages ate and drank but did nothing wrong
849,1898-145702-0004.flac,said they then the dragon seized them in his claws took them through the air over the army and set them down on the earth a long way from it he gave them a little whip saying
850,1898-145702-0008.flac,only confide your trouble in me
851,1898-145702-0003.flac,what use was it our deserting we must perish here miserably whilst they were speaking a fiery dragon came flying through the air
852,1898-145702-0018.flac,the dragon made a face and growled again three times m hm
853,1898-145720-0004.flac,so the next morning he got up early and put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders for he knew not how long his journey would take nor what sort of country he would have to go through only one thing he knew
854,1898-145720-0011.flac,but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him
855,1898-145720-0001.flac,many of the young braves sought her in marriage but she would listen to one only a handsome chief who had taken her fancy some years before so they were to be married and great rejoicings were made
856,1898-145720-0002.flac,but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid thinking of his happiness that was buried there at last after many days a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness
857,1898-145720-0006.flac,but grew less and less the further he went south till it disappeared altogether soon the trees put forth their buds and flowers sprang up under his feet and instead of thick clouds there was blue sky over his head and everywhere the birds were singing
858,1898-145720-0014.flac,when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey but they could not touch each other for between them rolled great waves which looked as if they would sink the boats
859,1898-145720-0012.flac,instead of hiding as he approached and birds circled round him
860,1898-145720-0018.flac,at the gate my messenger awaits you and you shall take again
861,1898-145720-0017.flac,but in the murmur of the wind he heard the master of life saying to him return whither you came for i have work for you to do and your people need you and for many years you shall rule over them
862,1898-145720-0003.flac,he remembered having heard from the old old people of the tribe that there was a path that led to the land of souls that if you sought carefully you could find it
863,1898-145720-0010.flac,at the water which lies far out yonder in the plains which stretch beyond
864,1898-145720-0000.flac,far away in north america where the red indians dwell
865,1898-145720-0016.flac,so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island and wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams and they knew not hunger nor thirst neither cold nor heat
866,1898-145720-0007.flac,and on the top of these he found a hut or wigwam an old man clothed in skins and holding a staff in his hand stood in the doorway
867,1898-145720-0013.flac,very soon he noticed with wonder that neither rocks nor trees barred his path he passed through them without knowing it for indeed they were not rocks and trees at all but only the souls of them for this was the land of shadows
868,1898-145720-0009.flac,to suffer him to rest and when he arose the old man rose too and stood with him at the door look he said
869,1898-145720-0015.flac,only the children had no fear and reached the other side in safety still though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these horrible sights and sounds no harm came to them for their lives had been free from evil
870,1898-145720-0008.flac,rest in my hut as she also rested and i will tell you what you ask and whither you should go on hearing these words the young man entered the hut but his heart was too eager within him
871,1898-145720-0005.flac,one of the old men say that the land of souls lay to the south and so filled with new hope and courage he set his face southwards for many many miles the country looked the same as it did round his own home
872,2436-2481-0018.flac,nor did prince her scream awakened him
873,2436-2481-0034.flac,we must get him i gathered my wits a surge of hate swept me a wild desire for vengeance why by god where is he
874,2436-2481-0029.flac,and hear him i don't want to kill you haljan we need you he gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms carried me swiftly across the deserted deck
875,2436-2481-0023.flac,someone outside trying to unseal the door in the darkness cylinder in hand i crept softly from the bunk crouched at the door this time i would capture or kill this night prowler
876,2436-2481-0024.flac,the sizzling was faintly audible my door seal was breaking upon impulse i reached for the door jerked it open no one there
877,2436-2481-0020.flac,it had only a bunk my tiny desk a chair and clothes robe there was no evidence of any intruder here i set my door and window alarm then i adiophone to the radio room snap yes
878,2436-2481-0028.flac,it caught me ran like ice through my veins seized and numbed my limbs i fell helpless to the deck nerves and muscles paralyzed my tongue was thick and inert i could not speak nor move
879,2436-2481-0025.flac,was empty but i leaped and struck a solid body crouching in the doorway a giant man
880,2436-2481-0000.flac,doctor frank's face had gone white snap stood like a statue of horror the deck here was patched as always with silver radiance from the deck ports the empty deck chair stood about the scream
881,2436-2481-0032.flac,she told us before she died died i leaped to my feet she died yes gregg an hour ago
882,2436-2481-0012.flac,i'll be there presently gregg he slammed the door upon me i followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror the turmoil of the ship gradually quieted snap went to the radio room
883,2436-2481-0016.flac,had opened anita's corridor door wasn't it sealed yes but the intruder opened it burst it
884,2436-2481-0026.flac,his electronized metallic robe burned my hands i lunged against him i was almost as surprised as he i shot but the stab of heat evidently missed him the shock of my encounter short circuited his robe he materialized in the starlight a brief
885,2436-2481-0037.flac,the door of the shining garden was closed a brief glimpse given to me and to her of what might have been and now
886,2436-2481-0027.flac,savage encounter he struck the weapon from my hand he had dropped his hydrogen torch and tried to grip me but i twisted away from his hold so it's you quiet gregg aljan i only want to talk without warning a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand

888,2436-2481-0001.flac,was stilled but now we heard a commotion inside the rasp of opening cabin doors questions from frightened passengers i found my voice anita anita prince come on
889,2436-2481-0015.flac,doctor frank and her brother are with her they're doing all they can he told us what had happened anita and george prince had both been asleep each in his respective room someone unknown
890,2436-2481-0017.flac,it wasn't broken the assailant opened it somehow and assaulted miss prince shot her in the chest with a heat ray her left lung shot her yes but she did not see who did it

893,2436-2481-0022.flac,tortured sleep i was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer someone was tampering with my door then the buzzer ceased the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it but it had done its work awakened me
894,2436-2481-0014.flac,but why by whom had george prince been in his own room when the attack came i thought now i recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with doctor frank
895,2436-2481-0003.flac,passengers standing at their cabin doors i shouted go back to your rooms we want order here keep back we came to the twin doors of a twenty two and a twenty both were closed doctor frank was an advance of snap in me now

898,2436-2481-0002.flac,he was dashing for the lounge archway doctor frank and i followed i realized that we passed the deck door and window of a twenty two but they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside
899,2436-2481-0036.flac,we don't want him killed not attacked even not yet we'll explain later they sat me down calming me anita dead
900,2436-2481-0030.flac,his warning siren rang out to alert the ship his spotlight clung to us miko ran with me a few steps then he cursed and dropped me fled away i fell like a sack of carbide to the deck

907,2436-2481-0033.flac,miko got into her stateroom and tried to force his love upon her she repulsed him he killed her it struck me blank and then with a rush came the thought
908,2436-2481-0005.flac,doctor frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon snap and me i was unarmed weapon in hand snap forced the panic stricken passengers back to their rooms snap reassured them glibly
909,2436-2481-0010.flac,tell blackstone what's happened but i don't know what's happened carter was grim and white
910,2436-2476-0005.flac,i went to my cabin it was located aft on the stern deck near the stern watch tower a small metal room with a chair a desk and a bunk i made sure no one was in it i sealed the lettice grill and the door
911,2436-2476-0025.flac,i answered her greeting and met george prince's casual gaze he too smiled as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service i had done her or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when i chased him
912,2436-2476-0004.flac,but why didn't johnson hear that eavesdropper and what was he doing there anyway at that hour of the morning the captain ignored my questions i'm going to have that princes suite searched we can't be too careful go to bed gregg you need rest
913,2436-2476-0034.flac,the martian equivalent of mister and miss

915,2436-2476-0009.flac,a flight ordinarily of some ten days there were five tables in the dining salon each with eight seats snap and i had one of the tables we sat at the ends with the passengers on each of the sides
916,2436-2476-0019.flac,i deal in tricks out at fool in audience his keen amused gaze was on obhahn this gentleman from venus and i have too much in common to argue
917,2436-2476-0033.flac,she looked as all martians like to look a very warlike amazon but she was a pretty girl she smiled at me with a keen eyed direct gaze mister dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome you are
918,2436-2476-0010.flac,gregg this is sero obhan i met the keen sombre gaze of a venus man of middle age a small slim graceful man with sleek black hair his pointed face accentuated by the pointed beard was pallid
919,2436-2476-0016.flac,and as a matter of fact we've an argument gregg laughed snap this is sir arthur coniston an english gentleman lecturer and sky trotter that is he will be a sky trotter he tells us he plans a number of voyages

921,2436-2476-0027.flac,my attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table i heard ob han's silky voice we passed quite close to the moon last night mister dean yes said snap we did didn't we always do
922,2436-2476-0039.flac,inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm an instant only then it dropped to his wrist but in that instant i had seen upon the gray flesh a thin sear turned red a very recent burn
923,2436-2476-0018.flac,the third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument snap introduced him as rance rankin an american a quiet blond fellow of thirty five or forty i ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on
924,2436-2476-0003.flac,when i mentioned the purser who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled past carter looked startled johnson is all right gregg does he know anything about this grantline affair no
925,2436-2476-0000.flac,i told him what snap and i had learned the rays from the moon proving that grantline had concentrated a considerable or body i also told him of grantline's message we'll stop on the way back as he directs gregg he bent closer to me
926,2436-2476-0029.flac,and i have never seen so keen a glance as rance rankin shot at me were all three people aware of grantline's treasure on the moon it suddenly seemed so i wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over captain carter was right
927,2436-2476-0014.flac,has just termed it fettishism
928,2436-2476-0013.flac,my mission is that all the universe shall hear of me he's preaching the religion of the venus mystics snap explained and this enlightened gentleman said obhan ironically nodding to the man
929,2436-2476-0015.flac,protested the man at olhahn's side
930,2436-2476-0035.flac,not spindly like most martians this fellow for all his seven feet in height was almost heavy set he wore a plaited leather jerkin beneath his robe and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed is gray hairy pillars of strength
931,2436-2476-0038.flac,had a touch of martian accent worn almost away by living for some years in greater new york the shock to me came within a few minutes
932,2436-2476-0020.flac,i like to eat an quiet arguing passengers always annoy me there were still three seats vacant at our table i wondered who would occupy them i soon learned the answer for one seat at least rankin said calmly
933,2436-2476-0037.flac,both martians and venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists
934,2436-2476-0031.flac,when another incident shocked me the two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats a martian girl and man the girl had the seat at my left with the man beside her all martians are tall
935,2436-2476-0023.flac,as a man who looked hardly twenty five he was at this moment evidently in a gay mood his clean cut handsome profile with its poetic dark curels
936,2436-2476-0026.flac,i gazed after his small white suited figure as he followed anita from the salon in thinking of her i prayed that carter and halsey might be wrong whatever plotting against the grantline expedition might be going on
937,2436-2476-0032.flac,the girl was about my own height that is six feet two inches the man was seven feet or more both wore the martian outer robe the girl flung hers back her limbs were encased in pseudo mail
938,2436-2476-0012.flac,i should have heard of you no doubt but a smile plucked at his thin gray lips
939,2436-2476-0017.flac,the tall englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgment my compliments mister haljan i hope you have no strong religious convictions else we will make your table here very miserable
940,2436-2476-0040.flac,as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm my mind flung back only last night in the city corridor snap and i had been followed by a martian i had shot at him with a heat ray i thought i had hit him on the arm
941,2436-2476-0021.flac,his glance went to the empty seat at my right hand the venza isn't that her name she and i are destined for the same theatre in ferrik shahn so venza was to sit beside me it was good news
942,2436-2476-0024.flac,there seemed little of the villain about him and i saw anita prince now as a dark haired black eyed little beauty in feature resembling her brother very strongly she presently finished her meal she rose with him after her
943,2436-2476-0028.flac,it's a technical problem of the exagenacies of intersteller navigation explain it to them gregg you're an expert i waved it away with a laugh there was a brief silence i could not help noticing sir arthur conniston's queer look
944,2436-2476-0008.flac,the moon had dwindled to a pin point of light beside the crescent earth and behind them our sun blazed visually the largest orb in the heavens it was some sixty eight million miles from the earth to mars
945,2436-2476-0036.flac,he had come into the salon with a swagger his sword ornament clanking a pleasant voyage so far he said to me as he started his meal his voice had the heavy throaty rasp characteristic of the martian he spoke perfect english
946,2436-2476-0022.flac,ten days of a religious argument three times a day would be intolerable but the cheerful venza would help she never eats the midday meal said snap she's on the deck having orange juise i guess it's the old gag about die et eh
947,2436-2476-0030.flac,coming back we should have a cordon of interplanetary police aboard sir arthur broke the awkward silence magnificent sight the moon from so close though i was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it
948,2436-2476-0001.flac,at ferrakshahn i'm going to bring back a cordon of interplanetary police the secret will be out of course when we stop at the moon we have no right even now to be flying this vessel as unguarded as it is he was very solemn
949,2436-2476-0007.flac,it was a low vaulted metal room with blue and yellow tube lights at its sides the oval windows showed the deck with its porchs on the dome side through which a vista of the starry firmament was visible we were well on our course to mars
950,2436-2476-0002.flac,and he was grim when i told him of the invisible eavesdropper you think he overheard grantline's message who was it you seem to feel it was george prince i told him i was convinced that prowler went into a twenty
951,2436-2477-0000.flac,i was i think of the planetara's officers the most expert handler of the mathematical calculators the locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was under ordinary circumstances about all i had to do
952,2436-2477-0030.flac,they wanted to know what kind of a ship this was why because shack has acute little eavesdropping microphone of his own he had it working last night he overheard george prince an that
953,2436-2477-0028.flac,they had a wonderful game with that englishman sir arthur this morning stripped him of half a pound of eight inch leaves a neat little stack a crooked game of course those fellows are more nimble fingered than rance rankin ever dared to be
954,2436-2477-0015.flac,but not within earshot why do you look so furtive she retorted gregg there's something strange about this voyage
955,2436-2477-0001.flac,and it took only a few minutes every twelve hours i had a moment with carter in the isolation of his chart room this voyage gregg i'm getting like you too fanciful we've normal group of passengers apparently
956,2436-2477-0022.flac,i saw the purser in the smoking room he was visible from wait venza that prowler went through the smoking room i know he did i could hear him
957,2436-2477-0005.flac,we'll all meet here gregg say about the zero hour we must take some precautions then he dismissed me i found venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck a port hole
958,2436-2477-0017.flac,do you know obhahn i interrupted she shook her head never heard of him but he told me plenty at breakfast by satan what a flow of words that devil driver can muster he and the englishmen don't mesh very well do they
959,2436-2477-0006.flac,with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her there was an empty seat near by she greeted me with the venus form of jocular intimate greening hola lo gregg sit here with me
960,2436-2477-0029.flac,i sat staring at her she was a mine of information this girl and gregg i tried my charms on sheck and dud nice men but dumb whatever's going on they're not in it
961,2436-2477-0026.flac,i well i do trust you really i do but the whole thing isn't mine to tell the sombre pools of her eyes were shining
962,2436-2477-0021.flac,deflecting invisible cloak you couldn't fool an audience with that it's too commonplace if france rankin tried i gripped her don't ramble venza you saw me yes my stateroom door was open i was sitting with a cigarette
963,2436-2477-0012.flac,she sat up to face me there's a fellow here on the planetara rance rankin he calls himself at our table a big good looking blond american he says he is a magician ever hear of him
964,2436-2477-0035.flac,he's a man find out what you can she drew away from me abruptly there's anita and george prince they came to the corner of the deck but turned back venza caught my look and understood it
965,2436-2477-0023.flac,the purser looked up followed the sound with his gaze i thought that was queer he never made a move and then you came along and he acted innocent why what's going on that's what i want to know i held my breath venza
966,2436-2477-0003.flac,nothing unusual among his things we searched both his room and his sisters i did not follow that up instead i told him about the burn on miko's thick arm he stared i wish we were at ferrik sharm gregg
967,2436-2477-0036.flac,she turned solemn you may be interested to know she loves you i could see it i knew it when i mentioned you to her this morning me why we've hardly spoken is it necessary
968,2436-2477-0014.flac,if he's a professional entertainer i'm a motor oiler it startled me why do you say that instinctively my gaze swept the deck an earthwoman and child
969,2436-2477-0018.flac,she stared at me i had not answered her grin my mind was too busy with queer fancies halsey's words things are not always what they seem were these passengers masqueraders were they put here by george prints
970,2436-2477-0009.flac,don't be silly venza i enjoyed her i gazed at her small slim figure reclining in the deck chair her long gray robe parted by design i have no doubt to display her shapely satin sheathed legs
971,2436-2477-0034.flac,shak's current was interrupted tell him to try it again venza i'll talk with him no i'd better let him alone can you get him to keep his mouth shut
972,2436-2477-0025.flac,i saw the door open and close i even thought i could see his blurred outline she added why should george prince be sneaking around with you after him and the purser acting innocent
973,2436-2477-0020.flac,they any one something's going on you know it you are in it i saw you this morning gregg wild eyed chasing a phantom you and i heard the phantom a man's footsteps a magnetic
974,2436-2477-0019.flac,i parried i mean a lot of things what we've just been talking about and what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning excitement gregg you may trust me for the first time she was wholly serious
975,2436-2477-0002.flac,but i don't like the look of any of them that obhahn at your table snaky looking fellow i commented he and the englishmen are great on arguments did you have prince's cabin searched my breath hung on his answer yes
976,2436-2477-0010.flac,her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck her carmine lips were parted with a mocking alluring smile the exotic perfume of her enveloped me she glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes
977,2436-2477-0031.flac,i gasped venza softer against all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape herself upon me her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear
978,2436-2477-0033.flac,a hundred pounds of gold leaf that's the purser's price he's with them whatever it is he promised to do something or other for them she stopped well i prompted that's all
979,2436-2477-0013.flac,that's what he told me no ive never heard of him nor did i and i thought i had heard of everyone of importance he is listed for the same theatr i am nice sort of fellow she paused then added
980,2436-2477-0004.flac,to night when the passengers are asleep come here to me snap will be here and doctor frank we can trust him he knows about about the grantline treasure yes and so do balch and blackstone balch and blackstone were our first and second officers
981,2436-2477-0032.flac,something about treasure on the moon shack couldn't understand what and they mentioned you then the purser joined them her whispered words tumbled over one another
982,2436-2477-0008.flac,no man will please me more
983,2436-2477-0011.flac,be serious i added i am serious sober intoxicated by you but sober i said what sort of a contract a theater in ferrekshahn good money gregg
984,2436-2477-0007.flac,i have been wondering when you would come after me i sat down beside her why are you going to mars venza i'm glad to see you many thanks but i am glad to see you gregg so handsome a man do you know from venus to earth
985,2436-2477-0016.flac,so you must know it as well as i do rance rankin i prompted she leaned closer toward me he could fool you but not me i've known too many magicians she grinned i challenged him to trick me
986,2436-2477-0024.flac,where did the prowler run to can you she whispered calmly
987,2436-2477-0027.flac,here's something i can tell you now we've two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard do you know that who are they shack and dud artley every detective in greater new york knows them
988,405-130895-0026.flac,with vegetables from the sea like the english with their irish stews the nautilus passed over these lush luxuriant depths with tremendous speed
989,405-130895-0033.flac,between twenty and twenty five meters and went along the south american coast
990,405-130895-0016.flac,now then that evening it became obvious much to my satisfaction that we were returning north by the atlantic route i shared the results of my observations with the canadian and conseil
991,405-130895-0020.flac,the land of fire a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives huts this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide
992,405-130895-0012.flac,yes i replied because we're going in the direction of the sun and here the sun is due north sure ned land went on but it remains to be seen whether we'll make for the atlantic or the pacific
993,405-130895-0004.flac,and what powerful inhalations the canadian drew like a furnace going full blast our strength returned promptly and when i looked around i saw that we were alone on the platform no crewmen
994,405-130895-0037.flac,captain nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of brazil's populous shores because he shot by with dizzying speed
995,405-130895-0031.flac,upside down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift
996,405-130895-0023.flac,yes sir a natural barometer that didn't let me down when i navigated the narrows of the strait of magellan just then its peak appeared before us standing out distinctly against the background of the skies this forecast fair weather
997,405-130895-0003.flac,what fine oxygen let master have no fears about breathing there's enough for everyone as for ned land he didn't say a word but his wide open jaws would have scared off a shark
998,405-130895-0002.flac,we could suck the atoms from the air by the lungful and it was the breeze the breeze itself that poured into us this luxurious intoxication ah conseil was putting in
999,405-130895-0001.flac,next to me my two companions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles poor souls who have suffered from long starvation mustn't pounce heedlessly on the first food given them we on the other hand didn't have to practise such moderation
1000,405-130895-0009.flac,it took my breath away in a manner of confounded by this lapse into banality conseil left his sentence hanging my friends i replied very moved
1001,405-130895-0014.flac,soon we had cleared the antarctic circle plus the promontory of cape horn
1002,405-130895-0030.flac,some of these jelly fish were shaped like very smooth semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons others looked like
1003,405-130895-0018.flac,we'll never regret having known him especially once we've left him ned land shot back the next day
1004,405-130895-0036.flac,near eleven o'clock in the morning we cut the tropic of capricorn on the thirty seventh meridian passing well out from cape frio much to ned land's displeasure
1005,405-130895-0027.flac,in these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of alge in particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the world's best mussels
1006,405-130895-0032.flac,shadows illusions melting and evaporating outside their native element when the last tips of the falkland islands had disappeared below the horizon
1007,405-130895-0008.flac,and you my gallant conseil you suffered a great deal not too much to be candid with master i was lacking a few throatfuls of air but i would have gotten by
1008,405-130895-0029.flac,i likewise marvelled at the numerous pedusas including the most beautiful of their breed the compass jelly fish unique to the falkland seas
1009,405-130895-0021.flac,its coast line looked flat but high mountains rose in the distance i even thought i glimpsed m sarmiento
1010,405-130895-0019.flac,when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon we raised land to the west
1011,405-130895-0035.flac,keeping to its northerly heading it followed the long windings of south america by then we had fared sixteen thousand leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan
1012,405-130895-0015.flac,by then all our past sufferings were forgotten the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds we had thoughts only of the future
1013,405-130895-0005.flac,those strange seamen on the nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air the first words i pronounced were words of appreciation
1014,405-130895-0017.flac,that's good news the canadian replied but where's the nautilus going i'm unable to say ned after the south pole
1015,405-130895-0028.flac,as for fish i specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the goby genus especially some gudgeon two decimeters long sprinkled with whitish and yellow spots
1016,405-130895-0000.flac,from cape horn to the amazon how i got onto the platform i'm unable to say perhaps the canadian transferred me there but i could breathe i could inhale the life giving sea air
1017,405-130895-0025.flac,it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks for crabs and cuttlefish here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal mixing meat from fish
1018,405-130895-0011.flac,conseil put in yes ned land went on you can repay your debt by coming with me when i leave this infernal nautilus by the way conseil said are we going in a favorable direction
1019,405-130895-0013.flac,but if we return to the pacific far from every populated shore what would happen to ned land's plans we would soon settle this important point the nautilus traveled swiftly
1020,405-130895-0007.flac,good lord professor ned land answered me don't mention it what did we do that's so praiseworthy not a thing it was a question of simple arithmetic your life is worth more than ours so we had to save it
1021,405-130895-0034.flac,didn't put in an appearance
1022,405-130895-0010.flac,we're bound to each other forever and i'm deeply indebted to you which i'll take advantage of the canadian shot back
1023,405-130895-0006.flac,and gratitude to my two companions ned and conseil had kept me alive during the final hours of our long death throes but no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion
1024,405-130895-0024.flac,bull bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens with their smooth viscous filaments they measured as much as three hundred meters long genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough
1025,405-130895-0022.flac,a pyramid shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit which depending on whether it's clear or veiled in vapor predicts fair weather or foul as ned land told me a first class barometer my friend
1026,405-130894-0059.flac,picks rang out on that bed of ice arms grew weary hands were rubbed raw but who cared about exhaustion what difference were wounds life sustaining air reached our lungs we could breathe we could breathe
1027,405-130894-0012.flac,after ned was dressed i re entered the lounge whose windows had been uncovered stationed next to conseil i examined the stratu surrounding and supporting the nautilus some moments later we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice
1028,405-130894-0043.flac,but there aren't ten feet of water ahead or astern of the nautilus all around us this frieze is gaining fast how long i asked will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to breathe on board the captain looked me straight in the eye
1029,405-130894-0022.flac,after twelve hours had gone by we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick hence about six hundred cubic meters assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours
1030,405-130894-0019.flac,but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner after two hours of energetic work ned land re entered exhausted he and his companions were replaced by new workmen including conseil and me
1031,405-130894-0027.flac,i know he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook couldn't change it's one more danger but i don't know any way of warding it off our sole chance of salvation
1032,405-130894-0062.flac,over the whole surface area only two meters were left to be removed only two meters separated us from the open sea but the ship's air tanks were nearly empty the little air that remained had to be saved for the workmen not an
1033,405-130894-0051.flac,that was one degree gained
1034,405-130894-0053.flac,the injections couldn't get it to go a single degree higher
1035,405-130894-0035.flac,obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free for an instant i was gripped by despair my pick nearly slipped from my hands what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone
1036,405-130894-0000.flac,chapter sixteen shortage of air consequently above below and around the nautilus there were impenetrable frozen walls we were the ice banks prisoners the canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist
1037,405-130894-0009.flac,my friends i said we're in a serious predicament but i'm counting on your courage and energy sir the canadian replied this is no time to bore you with my complaints
1038,405-130894-0065.flac,and he decided to crush this layer the man had kept his energy and composure he had subdued physical pain with moral strength he could still think plan and act at his orders the craft was eased off
1039,405-130894-0016.flac,six thousand five hundred cubic meters to dig a hole through which the ship could descend below this tract of ice work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity instead of digging all around the nautilus which would have entailed even greater difficulties
1040,405-130894-0011.flac,which was promptly accepted the canadian got into his underwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers
1041,405-130894-0070.flac,i squeezed it in an involuntary convulsion all at once carried away by its frightful excess load the nautilus sank into the waters like a cannon ball in other words dropping as if in a vacuum
1042,405-130894-0008.flac,hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks the nautilus slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of three hundred fifty meters the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged
1043,405-130894-0036.flac,a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster jaws irresistibly closing supervising our work
1044,405-130894-0075.flac,instead of breathing it themselves they had saved it from me and while they were suffocating they poured life into me drop by drop i tried to push the device away they held my hands and for a few moments i could breathe luxuriously
1045,405-130894-0052.flac,after i monitored the operation's progress double checking it with many inspections i told the captain it's working i think so he answered me we've escaped being crushed now we have only asphyxiation to fear
1046,405-130894-0017.flac,then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter and huge chunks were loosened from its mass
1047,405-130894-0061.flac,when his time was up he yielded his equipment to another and re entered the foul air on board always calm unflinching and uncomplaining that day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy
1048,405-130894-0049.flac,in a few minutes the water reached one hundred degrees centigrade it was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process the heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply going through the mechanism water drawn cold from the sea arrived
1049,405-130894-0002.flac,he said in a calm voice there are two ways of dying under the conditions in which we're placed this inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor working out a problem for his pupils the first way he went on
1050,405-130894-0058.flac,to leave more air for master it brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words since conditions inside were universally unbearable
1051,405-130894-0030.flac,near evening one more meter had been dug from the trench when i returned on board i was well nigh asphyxiated by the carbondioxide saturating the air oh if only we had the chemical methods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas
1052,405-130894-0077.flac,had he perished had his companions died with him
1053,405-130894-0031.flac,there was no lack of oxygen all this water contained a considerable amount
1054,405-130894-0055.flac,the air couldn't be renewed in the nautilus's interior accordingly that day it kept getting worse an unbearable heaviness weighed me down near three o'clock in the afternoon this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree
1055,405-130894-0010.flac,he can use me any way he wants he won't turn down your assistance come along ned i led the canadian to the room where the nautilus's men were putting on their diving suits i informed the captain of ned's proposition
1056,405-130894-0007.flac,i'm going to ground the nautilus on the lower shelf then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the thinnest of these ice walls can the panels in the lounge be left open without ill effect we're no longer in motion
1057,405-130894-0020.flac,the nautilus's chief officer supervised us the water struck me as unusually cold but i warmed up promptly while wielding my pick my movements were quite free although they were executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres
1058,405-130894-0063.flac,atom for the nautilus when i returned on board i felt half suffocated what a night i'm unable to depict it such sufferings are indescribable the next day i was short winded
1059,405-130894-0067.flac,the boat sank and was fitted into its socket just then the whole crew returned on board and the double outside door was closed by this point the nautilus was resting on a bed of ice only one meter thick
1060,405-130894-0057.flac,nearly unconscious my gallant conseil felt the same symptoms suffered the same sufferings yet never left my side he held my hand he kept encouraging me and i even heard him mutter
1061,405-130894-0026.flac,there was no point in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous rescue work but when i returned on board
1062,405-130894-0047.flac,it's worth trying i said resolutely so let's try it professor
1063,405-130894-0023.flac,before the nautilus could return to the surface of the waves couldn't we all die of asphyxiation were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice it was a dreadful state of affairs but we faced it head on
1064,405-130894-0015.flac,there we were separated from the sea by a ten meter barrier that's how thick the iceberg was from this point on it was an issue of cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the nautilus's waterline this meant detaching about
1065,405-130894-0048.flac,captain nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at work supplying drinking water via evaporation the mechanism was loaded with water and the full electric heat of our batteries was thrown into coils a wash in liquid
1066,405-130894-0037.flac,working himself captain nemo passed near me just then i touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our prison the starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four meters from the nautilus's hull
1067,405-130894-0029.flac,the work kept me going besides working meant leaving the nautilus which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by our equipment which meant leaving the thin foul air behind
1068,405-130894-0064.flac,headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me reel like a drunk my companions were experiencing the same symptoms some crewmen were at their last gasp
1069,405-130894-0006.flac,well then captain let's free ourselves within forty eight hours we'll try to at least by cutting through one of these walls surrounding us which one i asked borings will tell us that
1070,405-130894-0005.flac,but they'll supply air for only two days now then we've been buried beneath the waters for thirty six hours and the nautilus's heavy atmosphere already needs renewing in another forty eight hours our reserve air will be used up
1071,405-130894-0003.flac,is death by crushing the second is death by asphyxiation i don't mention the possibility of death by starvation because the nautilus's provisions will certainly last longer than we will
1072,405-130894-0054.flac,i was finally assured that there was no danger of it solidifying by the next day march twenty seventh six meters of ice had been torn from the socket only four meters were left to be removed that still meant forty eight hours of work
1073,405-130894-0073.flac,my muscles had no power to contract i'm unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way but i was aware that my death throws had begun i realized that i was about to die suddenly i regained consciousness
1074,405-130894-0013.flac,before digging into the ice the captain had to obtain borings to insure working in the best direction long bores were driven into the side walls but after fifteen meters the instruments were still impeded by the thickness of those walls
1075,405-130894-0041.flac,could come to our rescue don't you see that by solidifying it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us just as its freezing can burst the hardest stones aren't you aware that this force could be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction
1076,405-130894-0042.flac,i know it sir so we can't rely on nature to rescue us only our own efforts we must counteract this solidification we must hold it in check not only are the side walls closing in
1077,405-130894-0068.flac,we listened we forgot our sufferings we hoped once more we had staked our salvation on this one last gambl despite the buzzing in my head i soon could hear vibrations under the nautilus's hull we tilted
1078,405-130894-0072.flac,brought to full speed the propeller made the sheet iron hull tremble down to its rivets and we sped northward but how long would it take to navigate under the ice bank to the open sea another day i would be dead first
1079,405-130894-0040.flac,if only my nautilus were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed well i asked not catching the captain's meaning don't you understand he went on that the congealing of this water
1080,405-130894-0078.flac,separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice could we break through it
1081,405-130894-0044.flac,it was now the twenty sixth we had lived off the ship's stores for five days and all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen even to day as i write these lines my sensations are so intense
1082,405-130894-0033.flac,and shake them continually but this substance was missing on board and nothing else could replace it
1083,405-130894-0004.flac,therefore let's concentrate on our chances of being crushed or asphyxiated as for asphyxiation captain i replied that isn't a cause for alarm because the air tanks are full true
1084,405-130894-0050.flac,boiling hot at the body of the pump the steaming water was injected into the icy water outside and after three hours had passed
1085,405-130894-0076.flac,my eyes flew toward the clock it was eleven in the morning it had to be march twenty eighth the nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of forty miles per hour it was writhing in the waters
1086,405-130894-0045.flac,that an involuntary terror sweeps over me and my lungs still seem short of air meanwhile
1087,405-130894-0071.flac,our full electric power was then put on the pumps which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks after a few minutes we had checked our fall the pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement
1088,405-130894-0039.flac,or we'll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement yes i said but what can we do oh he exclaimed
1089,405-130894-0060.flac,and yet nobody prolonged his underwaterwork beyond the time allotted him his shift over each man surrendered to a gasping companion the air tank that would revive him
1090,405-130894-0018.flac,these chunks weighed less than the water and by an unusual effect of specific gravity each chunk took wing as it were to the roof of the tunnel
1091,405-130894-0066.flac,in other words it was raised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity when it was afloat the crew towed it leading it right above the immense trench outline to match the ship's water line next the ballast tanks filled with water
1092,405-130894-0021.flac,and the nautilus's atmosphere which was already charged with carbon dioxide the air hadn't been renewed in forty eight hours and its life giving qualities were considerably weakened meanwhile
1093,405-130894-0038.flac,the captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him we returned on board my diving suit removed i went with him to the lounge professor aronnax he told me this calls for heroic measures
1094,405-130894-0032.flac,this life giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us i had thought it all out but to no avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship to absorb it we would need to fill containers with potassium hydroxide
1095,405-130894-0024.flac,each one of us determined to do his duty to the end during the night in line with my forecasts a new one meter slice was removed from this immense socket but in the morning wearing my diving suit
1096,405-130894-0056.flac,yawns dislocated my jaws my lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing now growing scarcer and scarcer my mind was in a daze i lay outstretched strength gone
1097,405-130894-0074.flac,a few whifts of air had entered my lungs had we risen to the surface of the waves had we cleared the ice bank no ned and conseil my two gallant friends were sacrificing themselves to save me
1098,405-130894-0001.flac,conseil kept still i stared at the captain his face had resumed its usual emotionlessness he crossed his arms he pondered the nautilus did not stir the captain then broke into speech gentlemen
1099,405-130894-0014.flac,more than four hundred meters high
1100,405-130894-0046.flac,boiling water i exclaimed yes sir we're shut up in a relatively confined area if the nautilus's pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space wouldn't that raise its temperature and delay its freezing
1101,405-130894-0025.flac,when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other the liquid strata farthest from the trench not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools were showing a tendency to solidify in the face of this imminent new danger
1102,405-130894-0069.flac,the ice cracked with an odd ripping sound like paper tearing and the nautilus began settling downward we're going through conseil muttered in my ear i couldn't answer him i clutched his hand
1103,405-130894-0034.flac,without this precaution we wouldn't have awakened the following morning the next day march twenty sixth i returned to my miner's trade working to remove the fifth meter the ice banks side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened
1104,405-130894-0028.flac,is to work faster than the water solidifies we've got to get there first that's all get there first by then i should have been used to this type of talk for several hours that day i wielded my pick doggedly
1105,4137-11701-0035.flac,oh very well if you're going to drop all your former friends go on then but when i'm married there will always be a place for understand once and for all said udo angrily that i am not getting married no don't take my arm
1106,4137-11701-0036.flac,we can talk quite well like this i am sorry udo said coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position it wasn't in the least compromising
1107,4137-11701-0002.flac,we will be her most humble obedient servants she shall have everything she wants including prince udo smiled hyacinth that's a splendid idea we'll make her have udo
1108,4137-11701-0017.flac,ah what a miracle worker true love is i think one of the things which made belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say
1109,4137-11701-0016.flac,a different thing countess from when i last saw him
1110,4137-11701-0018.flac,meanwhile udo of course blundered along gaily we aren't exactly princess i mean what are you doing here coronel i didn't know princess that you
1111,4137-11701-0015.flac,udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bewildered highness on the back aren't you udo and i can think of no one more suitable in every way he bowed again and turned back to the prince well udo you're looking splendid
1112,4137-11701-0019.flac,the countess and i were just having a little i was just telling her what you said about how did you get here coronel shall we tell him said coronel with a smile at hyacinth hyacinth nodded
1113,4137-11701-0039.flac,once more i am not going to marry her well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story poor innocent girl well let's forget about it and now tell me how do you like euralia
1114,4137-11701-0022.flac,more than adviser she guessed to hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt and as for the king it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her
1115,4137-11701-0045.flac,was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for after all he had been no more gallant than was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions
1116,4137-11701-0006.flac,prince coronel will be staying here said the princess prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both and if they discuss those things in the servants halls of those days
1117,4137-11701-0005.flac,be very close coronel she whispered and then they walked out together if any of the servants at the palace were surprised to see coronel they did not show it after all that was their business
1118,4137-11701-0031.flac,and now said the prince tell me what you are doing here coronel put his arm in udo's and walked him up and down the flagged path you're approaching marriage
1119,4137-11701-0013.flac,he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvane's face she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him why whoever is this she said getting to her feet before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon
1120,4137-11701-0007.flac,no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth bless her pretty face had found her man at last
1121,4137-11701-0028.flac,you know of course that his majesty comes back to morrow with all his army she did not swoon or utter a cry she did not plead the vapours or the megrims
1122,4137-11701-0046.flac,of course he ought to have left euralia long ago but he had stayed on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that and he had certainly neglected the princess a little
1123,4137-11701-0014.flac,the princess and coronel were upon them ah countess i thought we should find you together said hyacinth archly let me present to you my friend the duke coronel
1124,4137-11701-0042.flac,udo evidently hadn't thought of this he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened she couldn't do anything
1125,4137-11701-0040.flac,said udo stiffly well perhaps you are right i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way udo who was about to enter the palace turned round with a startled look what do you mean
1126,4137-11701-0050.flac,i must ask you not to refer to it if i marry the countess you'll be a very lucky man put in coronel i happen to know that the king of euralia however she's chosen you it seems
1127,4137-11701-0038.flac,ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that
1128,4137-11701-0008.flac,but i get no assistance from roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders i say said coronel as they went up the grand staircase i'm not a prince you know don't say i have deceived you
1129,4137-11701-0027.flac,there's no holding udo once he begins volunteered coronel he's the most desperate lover in araby my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth
1130,4137-11701-0044.flac,udo dropped undecidedly into a seat this wanted thinking out the countess what was wrong with her after all and she evidently adored him of course that was not surprising the question was
1131,4137-11701-0037.flac,protested udo indignantly
1132,4137-11701-0020.flac,i rode said coronel it's a secret he added
1133,4137-11701-0024.flac,udo and i here she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronel's took udo's boldly without any more maidenly nonsense udo and i love each other say something udo
1134,4137-11701-0021.flac,explained hyacinth and hearing that there was to be a wedding added coronel belvane made up her mind coronel was evidently a very different man from udo if he stayed in euralia as adviser
1135,4137-11701-0003.flac,it will annoy your father but one can't please everybody oh i can see myself enjoying this they got up and wandered back along wiggs's path hand in hand i'm almost afraid to leave the forest said hyacinth
1136,4137-11701-0047.flac,after all again why not marry the countess it was absurd to suppose there was anything in coronel's nonsense but one never knew not that he was marrying her out of fear no certainly not it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part
1137,4137-11701-0001.flac,that's what makes it so jolly we can do what we like and it doesn't matter if it doesn't come off so just for fun let's think of something to pay her out i feel i don't want to hurt anybody to day all right we won't hurt her we'll humor her
1138,4137-11701-0030.flac,and with a curtsy she was gone coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth i'm enjoying this he seemed to say well she announced i must be going in too there'll be much to see about
1139,4137-11701-0049.flac,i'm not in the least frightened by the countess my dear udo what a speech for a lover of course you're not after all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again
1140,4137-11701-0033.flac,there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now
1141,4137-11701-0012.flac,and then said udo i jumped quickly to the right and whirling my no wait a bit that was later i jumped quickly to my left yes i remember it now it was my left i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my
1142,4137-11701-0011.flac,it was more than udo did just now he was with her in her garden telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with the dragon apparently in its dotage to which belvane was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator
1143,4137-11701-0010.flac,father will make you a proper prince directly he comes back will he that's what i'm wondering you see he doesn't know yet about our little present to the countess but it is quite time we got back to belvane we have left her alone too long
1144,4137-11701-0052.flac,coronel shook him solemnly by the hand i congratulate your royal highness i will announce your decision to the princess she will be much amute much delighted and he turned into the palace
1145,4137-11701-0029.flac,she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace she said if your royal highness will excuse me
1146,4137-11701-0025.flac,prompted coronel er yes said udo very unwillingly and decided he would explain it all afterwards whatever his feelings for the countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage oh i'm so glad
1147,4137-11701-0051.flac,personally i can't make out what she sees in you what is it i should have thought it was quite obvious said udo with dignity well coronel i think perhaps you are right and that it's my duty to marry her
1148,4137-11701-0009.flac,you are my prince said hyacinth proudly my dear i am a king among men to day and you are my queen but that's in our own special country of two if you are so particular said hyacinth with a smile
1149,4137-11701-0023.flac,we didn't want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our secret your royal highness she looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on
1150,4137-11701-0032.flac,he said its the talk of araby naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was like my dear udo she's charming i congratulate you don't be a fool coronel i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her
1151,4137-11701-0000.flac,and now said coronel we'd better decide what to do but i don't mind what we do now said hyacinth happily she may have the throne and father and udo and
1152,4137-11701-0026.flac,said hyacinth i felt somehow that it must be coming because you've seen so much of each other lately wiggs and i have often talked about it together what has happened to the child thought belvane she isn't a child at all she's grown up
1153,4137-11701-0048.flac,the poor woman had misunderstood him and she should not be disappointed she seems fond of flowers said coronel you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you now understand clearly coronel
1154,4137-11701-0043.flac,yes but of course the chance might come again you'd have the thing hanging over you always she's clever you know and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy lovely flowers aren't they what's the name of this one
1155,4137-11701-0034.flac,yes i think you may take our word for it that it's true i haven't the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for
1156,4137-11701-0041.flac,you never told me your precious countess whom you expect me to marry how very unkind of her a nasty person to annoy he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully
1157,4137-11701-0004.flac,in case something happens what should happen i don't know but all our life together has been in the forest and i'm just a little afraid of the world
1158,4137-11702-0058.flac,what do you say to the princess elvira of tregong i know his father had hopes in that direction hyacinth looked round at coronel as if appealing for his support he took a step towards her
1159,4137-11702-0001.flac,so far as is known this was her only work but she built up some reputation on it and belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius to be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men
1160,4137-11702-0025.flac,but she was still engrossed with the whiskers
1161,4137-11702-0024.flac,by the way he added henry is marrying and settling down in barodia it is curious he went on how after a war one's thoughts turned to matrimony he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this
1162,4137-11702-0028.flac,he told her of his secret journey to the king of barodia's tent he told her of the king of barodia's letter
1163,4137-11702-0029.flac,and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent
1164,4137-11702-0049.flac,tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war and how you pretended to be a swineherd and how could any father have resisted in a little while hyacinth and coronel were seated eagerly at his feet
1165,4137-11702-0012.flac,down the steps came hyacinth all blue and gold and flung herself into her father's arms my dear child said merriwig as he patted her soothingly there there it's your old father come back again herm there there
1166,4137-11702-0008.flac,hyacinth would be growing up and getting married soon life would be lonely in euralia then unless should he risk it
1167,4137-11702-0030.flac,to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings and by and by the moment came of which coronel had spoken and now said merriwig
1168,4137-11702-0011.flac,or shall i stay here in the countess's garden and amuse myself with udo anyhow i'll give you an hour alone together first the cavalcade drew up in front of the castle handkerchiefs fluttered to them from the walls trumpets were blown hounds bayed
1169,4137-11702-0031.flac,nothing much i suppose he waited nervously wondering if hyacinth would realize that all was meant to include more particularly belvane hyacinth drew a stool up to her father's chair and sat down very close to him
1170,4137-11702-0033.flac,it's rather serious but it's rather nice father dear would you mind very much if i got married soon my dear you shall get married as soon as you like let me see there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day
1171,4137-11702-0020.flac,said merriwig heartily we shan't have any trouble in that direction again i fancy do tell me did the king of barodia apologize he did better than that he abdicated why
1172,4137-11702-0045.flac,he would say these are matters for men to discuss but hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell coronel the truth of the matter afterwards it really looked as if coronel would have to be led into the secret too
1173,4137-11702-0057.flac,he came to stay with you and he never his royal highness put in coronel has given his affections to another aha so that's the secret now i wonder if i can guess who she is
1174,4137-11702-0059.flac,no it's not the princess elvira said hyacinth a little nervously the king laughed good humoredly ah well you must tell me he said
1175,4137-11702-0036.flac,let me see there's that seven headed bull he's getting a little old now but he was good enough for the last one we might i don't want a suitor said hyacinth softly i have one merriwig leant forward with eagerness
1176,4137-11702-0009.flac,he must be longing to tell you that oh he'll have a hundred things to tell you first but then when he says and what's been happening here while i've been away nothing much i suppose then you can say
1177,4137-11702-0026.flac,i can't plant them in the garden i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia isn't that a little unkind now that the poor man's dead merriwig looked round him to see that there were no eavesdroppers
1178,4137-11702-0055.flac,perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor too hyacinth and coronel interchanged a smile alas father she said his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms
1179,4137-11702-0040.flac,and who might coronel be said the king rather sternly he's he's well he's here he is father she ran up to him impulsively as he came in at the door
1180,4137-11702-0018.flac,there was another storm of cheers the battle cry of euralia ho ho merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes hyacinth and merriwig went into the palace
1181,4137-11702-0060.flac,hyacinth put out her hand and coronel pressed it encouragingly his royal highness prince udo she said
1182,4137-11702-0004.flac,henry having caught a glimpse of the chief armorer's daughter had accepted without any false pride and had frequently dropped in to supper thereafter now that the war was over he found that he could not tear himself away
1183,4137-11702-0010.flac,then i shall say nothing much only coronel and such a clever oh i have my ideas said coronel well i'll be out of the way somewhere i think i'll go for a walk in the forest
1184,4137-11702-0044.flac,he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure an adventure after his own heart merriwig was in an awkward position he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room leave us my child
1185,4137-11702-0041.flac,oh coronel you're just in time do tell father who you are coronel bowed profoundly to the king before i explain myself your majesty he said
1186,4137-11702-0054.flac,that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia there is only one man who could have got those truly an excellent young man well we'll arrange something said merriwig looking pleased
1187,4137-11702-0015.flac,of our mothers and wives and daughters prolonged cheering as the case may be hear hear
1188,4137-11702-0013.flac,he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down my little hyacinth my own little girl oh father i am glad to have you back there there my child
1189,4137-11702-0016.flac,in honor of our great victory i decree that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout euralia terrific cheering
1190,4137-11702-0006.flac,were in his pocket days of honored leisure were waiting for him he gazed at each remembered landmark of his own beloved country his heart overflowing with thankfulness never again would he leave euralia how good to see hyacinth again
1191,4137-11702-0043.flac,is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of barodia's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it
1192,4137-11702-0042.flac,may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the brodians from the little i have gathered outside it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred but of course i am longing to hear the full story from your majesty's own lips
1193,4137-11702-0039.flac,by the way who is he he comes from araby and his name is udo of course why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement my dear it isn't udo i'm afraid father it's coronel
1194,4137-11702-0005.flac,with king merriwig's permission he was settling in barodia and with the chief armourer's permission he was starting on his new life as a married man as the towers of the castle came in sight merriwig drew a deep breath of happiness home again
1195,4137-11702-0047.flac,it happened like this once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the king's letter to him but your majesty cried coronel
1196,4137-11702-0046.flac,there are certain state reasons he said with dignity why that story has been allowed to get about pardon your majesty i have no wish to but as you know so much you may as well know all
1197,4137-11702-0052.flac,that said coronel simply is much more surprising merriwig however was not so sure of that he liked the look of coronel he liked his manner
1198,4137-11702-0000.flac,a contemporary poet of the country king merriwig the first rode back from war as many other kings had done before five hundred men behind him were in sight left right left right left right left right left right
1199,4137-11702-0021.flac,well said merriwig remembering just in time i er killed him oh father how rough of you i don't think it hurt him very much my dear
1200,4137-11702-0048.flac,so you like it said merriwig trying to look modest i love it i knew he'd love it put in hyacinth it's just the sort of story that coronel would love
1201,4137-11702-0032.flac,father she said stroking his hand where it rested on his knee i have got some news for you nothing about the count nothing serious i hope said merriwig in alarm
1202,4137-11702-0037.flac,my dear this is indeed news tell me all about it upon what quest did you send him hyacinth had felt this coming
1203,4137-11702-0053.flac,and he saw at once that he knew a good story when he heard one of course he said you'll have to win her anything your majesty sets me to do it's as well he added with a disarming smile
1204,4137-11702-0022.flac,see i have brought these home for you he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper oh how exciting whatever can it be merriwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers
1205,4137-11702-0023.flac,neatly tied up with blue ribbon father he picked out the left one fons et origo if he had known any latin of the war and held it up for hyacinth's inspection there you can see the place where henry small nose's arrow bent it
1206,4137-11702-0007.flac,poor little hyacinth left all alone but there she had had the countess belvane a woman of great experience to help her belvane should he risk it how much had she thought of him while he was away
1207,4137-11702-0038.flac,what is his income a man must prove his worth in some way i haven't sent him away at all yet she said he's only just come he's been very kind to me and i'm sure you'll love him well well we'll arrange something for him
1208,4137-11702-0017.flac,here he turned and embraced his daughter again and if his eye travelled over her shoulder in the direction of belvane's garden it is a small matter and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame
1209,4137-11702-0002.flac,henry small nose a bowman of considerable promise had been left behind in the enemy's country the one casualty of war while spying out the land in the early days of the invasion
1210,4137-11702-0050.flac,and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures well well said the king at the end of it when he had received their tribute of admiration those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in war time he turned to coronel
1211,4137-11702-0027.flac,can you keep a secret he asked mysteriously of course said hyacinth deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told coronel well then listen
1212,4137-11702-0019.flac,now father said hyacinth later on when merriwig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself you've got to tell me all about it i can hardly believe it's really over yes yes it's all over
1213,4137-11702-0014.flac,he took a step forward and addressed his troops men of euralia cheers we have returned from a long and arduous conflict cheers to the embraces loud cheers
1214,4137-11702-0035.flac,no matter dear we can easily find you plenty more suitors indeed the subject has been very near my thoughts lately we'll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighboring countries there'll be no lack of candidates
1215,4137-11702-0003.flac,he had been discovered by the chief armorer of barodia at full length on the wet grass searching for tracks the chief armorer a kindly man
1216,4137-11702-0034.flac,i sent them off on adventures of some kind but dear me yes they ought to have been back by now i suppose you haven't heard anything of them no father said hyacinth with a little smile ah well no doubt they were unsuccessful
1217,4137-11702-0056.flac,wait till he has seen them my dear said merriwig with a chuckle he has seen them father what you invited him here
1218,4137-11702-0051.flac,and so you i understand wishd to marry my daughter does that surprise your majesty well no it doesn't and she i understand wishes to marry you yes please father
1219,8419-286676-0007.flac,the adders were always away people said that the adders were afraid of them the yellow brown frog wished that the adders could be scared badly scared some time so scared that a chilly feeling would run down their backs from their heads clear to the tips of their tails
1220,8419-286676-0004.flac,that was belostoma's way he would sting people who bothered him but then he always said that they need not have bothered him and perhaps that was so with the water adders it was different they were good natured enough
1221,8419-286676-0006.flac,they had such ugly mouths and such quick motions the larger fishes kept away on account of their children who were small and tender one might think that the sand hill cranes the fish hawks and the other shore families would have been good friends for them but when they called
1222,8419-286676-0026.flac,ouch ouch what is the matter asked the mud turtle then he began to slap the water with his short stout tail and say ouch
1223,8419-286676-0022.flac,i think the ducks spoil their children said she they make such a fuss over them and they are not nearly so bright as my children why mine hatch as soon as the eggs are laid and go hunting at once they are no trouble at all
1224,8419-286676-0013.flac,it is useful in feeling of things she said and then i have always thought it quite becoming she could see herself reflected in the still water below her and she noticed how prettily the dark brown of her back shaded into the white of her belly
1225,8419-286676-0018.flac,they do not always take so many home as they brought the snapping turtle became very much interested in his warty right foreleg and did not seem to hear what she said the mud turtle smiled i have heard she went on
1226,8419-286676-0012.flac,with her tail twisted carelessly around a willow branch the snapping turtle and a mud turtle father were in the shallow water below her her slender forked tongue was darting in and out of her open mouth
1227,8419-286676-0009.flac,but people said that one of the adders had frightened the yellow brown frog so that he never got over it and this was the reason he felt so the water adders were certainly the cleverest people in the pond
1228,8419-286676-0024.flac,most of them remarked the turtles all of them she said except us adders and the turtles i even think that some of the turtles are a little queer don't you we have thought so said the mud turtle
1229,8419-286676-0002.flac,and that he had a bad habit of using his stout sucking tube to sting with still belostoma did not care he said a giant water bug does not always live in the water i shall have my wings soon and leave the water and marry
1230,8419-286676-0033.flac,but then you know we are not stupid of course not replied the mud turtle
1231,8419-286676-0030.flac,asked the water adder in her sweetest voice nothing is easier and she wound herself around the willow branch in another graceful position and took the tip of her tail daintily between her teeth humph said the snapping turtle
1232,8419-286676-0025.flac,they certainly are agreed the snapping turtle who was beginning to feel much better natured what did you say asked the adder who like all her family was a little deaf ouch exclaimed the snapping turtle
1233,8419-286676-0031.flac,and he pulled his tail out of the mud and swam away
1234,8419-286676-0028.flac,and he backed into the mud knowing that fine soft mud is the best thing in the world for stings
1235,8419-286676-0014.flac,you see she was vain as well as clever the snapping turtle felt cross to day and had come to see if a talk with her would not make him feel better the mud turtle was tired of having the children sprawl around him
1236,8419-286676-0000.flac,the clever water adder none of the pond people were alone more than the water adders the snapping turtle was left to himself a great deal until the day when he and belostoma drove away the boys after that
1237,8419-286676-0001.flac,his neighbors began to understand him better and he was less grumpy so that those who wore shells were soon quite fond of him belostoma did not have many friends among the smaller people and only a few among the larger ones they said that he was cruel
1238,8419-286676-0020.flac,asked the snapping turtle and he was snappy about it oh nothing replied the water adder swinging her head back and forth and looking at the scales on her body i know what you mean said the snapping turtle
1239,8419-286676-0010.flac,she could do almost anything and she knew it she talked about it too and that showed bad taste and was one reason why she was not liked better she could swim very fast could creep glide
1240,8419-286676-0023.flac,i never worry about mine said the mud turtle although their mother thinks it is not safe for them all to sleep at once as they do on a log in the sunshine it isn't said the adder decidedly i never close my eyes
1241,8419-286676-0019.flac,that when young ducks dive head first they are quite sure to come up again but that when they dive feet first they never come up
1242,8419-286676-0016.flac,and fly around in the sunshine to find food for their children ah yes said the mud turtle how they must wish for shells humph said the snapping turtle what for to fly with
1243,8419-286676-0032.flac,said the mud turtle and he swam away with the snapping turtle what a rude person she is they said always trying to show how much more clever she is than other people we would rather be stupid and polite after a while the snapping turtle said
1244,8419-286676-0027.flac,two naughty young water boatmen had swung quietly up on their backs and stung the turtles on their tails then they swam away pushing themselves quickly through the water with swift strokes of their hairy oar legs
1245,8419-286676-0015.flac,and of missus mud turtle telling about the trouble she had to get the right kind of food the clever water adder spoke first of the weather it must be dreadfully hot for the shore people she said
1246,8419-286676-0005.flac,yet the mud turtles and snapping turtle were the only ones who ever called upon them and found them at home the small people without shells were afraid of them and the clams and pond snails never called upon any one the minnows said they could not bear the looks of the adders
1247,8419-286676-0011.flac,catch hold of things with her tail hang herself from the branch of a tree lift her head far into the air leap dart bound and dive all her family could do these things but she could do them a little the best one day she was hanging over the pond in a very graceful position
1248,8419-286676-0003.flac,after that i shall fly away on my wedding trip missus bellostoma may go with me if she feels like doing so after laying her eggs here i shall go anyway and i shall flutter and sprawl around the light and sting people who bother me and have a happy time
1249,8419-286676-0021.flac,and you know what you mean but i have to eat something and if i am swimming under the water and a duckling paddles along just above me and sticks his foot into my mouth i am likely to swallow him before i think the water adder saw that he was provoked by what she had said so she talked about something else
1250,8419-286676-0008.flac,i wish said he that the chilly feeling would be big enough to go way through to their bellies their bellies are only the front side of their backs anyway he added because they are so thin of course this was a dreadful wish to make
1251,8419-286676-0017.flac,let them come in swimming with their children if they are warm and tired the water adder laughed in her snaky way and showed her sharp teeth i have heard she said that when the wild ducks bring their children here to swim
1252,8419-286676-0029.flac,if i could only reach my tail with my head or even with one of my hind feet
1253,8419-286667-0016.flac,then they stood and fished for a long time without saying anything when she flew away she said that is a very pleasant fishing place he stood on the other leg for a while and thought how sweet her voice sounded as she said it
1254,8419-286667-0020.flac,if he had been an older crane and understood the ways of the world a little better he would have known that she meant aren't you coming to that fishing place i am going now
1255,8419-286667-0007.flac,while they trumpeted or called out good bye stop for us in the fall the flying cranes trumpeted back we will don't forget us that night they slept near together as they had done when with the large flock
1256,8419-286667-0003.flac,as they came near the pond they flew lower and lower until all swept down to the earth and alighted tall and stately by the edge of the water they had eaten nothing for several days and were soon hunting for food some on land
1257,8419-286667-0021.flac,still although he was such a young crane and had never danced until this year he began to think that she liked him and enjoyed having him near so he flew off to the fishing place where he had seen her the day before and he stalked along to where she was
1258,8419-286667-0001.flac,or if they had been flying by night as they usually did they would have stayed nearer the ground and their leader would have trumpeted loudly to let his followers know which way he was going they would also have trumpeted but more softly to tell him that they were coming after
1259,8419-286667-0029.flac,it is a lovely place but i could never have a nest alone let me help you he said i want to marry and have a home why said she as she preened her feathers that is a very good plan
1260,8419-286667-0025.flac,and she said she couldn't remember that she never could remember what she had forgotten it made him feel very badly to have her leave him so he wanted a chance to tell her something yet whenever he tried to it seemed to stick in his bill he began to fear that she didn't like him
1261,8419-286667-0019.flac,as she stalked off toward the pond she passed him and she said over her shoulder i should think you would be hungry i am almost starved after she had gone he wondered why she had said that
1262,8419-286667-0018.flac,he bowed to her oftener than to any of the rest and he thought she noticed it they danced until they were almost too tired to move
1263,8419-286667-0010.flac,a fine young fellow began to strut up and down before the rest bowing low and leaping high into the air and every now and then whooping as loudly as he could the gulls who had spent the winter by the pond screamed to each other the crane dance has begun
1264,8419-286667-0004.flac,and some in the water for they had stopped to feed and rest those who hunted in the water did so very quietly a crane would stand on one leg with his head against his breast so quietly that one might think him asleep but as soon as anything eatable came near
1265,8419-286667-0011.flac,even the frogs who are afraid of cranes crept quietly near to look on it was not long before another young crane began to skip and hop and circle around drooping his wings and whooping as he went
1266,8419-286667-0002.flac,they were a fine company to look upon orderly strong and dignified their long necks were stretched out straight ahead their long legs straight behind and they beat the air with slow regular strokes of the strong wings
1267,8419-286667-0000.flac,the dance of the sand hill cranes one fine day in spring a great flock of sand hill cranes came from the south they were flying high and quietly because the weather was bright if it had been stormy
1268,8419-286667-0023.flac,for all the eight cranes had danced together but he thought it very wonderful did you notice to whom i bowed he asked he was so excited that his knees shook and he had to stand on both legs at once to keep from falling
1269,8419-286667-0006.flac,they were those who thought of staying there for the summer when the flock arose to fly on again eight cranes stayed behind they watched their friends fly away and stood on the ground with their necks and bills uplifted and mouths open
1270,8419-286667-0008.flac,and one crane kept awake to watch for danger while the others tucked their heads under their wings they were fine looking even when they slept and some people never look well unless they are awake they were brownish gray with no bright markings at all
1271,8419-286667-0026.flac,and the next time the cranes danced he didn't bow to her so much but he strutted and leaped and whooped even more and she strutted and leaped and whooped almost as loudly as he when they were all tired out and had stopped dancing she said to him i am so tired
1272,8419-286667-0028.flac,and was afraid she might marry him if he was not quick now he pointed with one wing to this nesting place and said how would you like to build a nest there she looked to where he had pointed i she said why
1273,8419-286667-0012.flac,every crane danced brothers and sisters and all and as they did so they looked lovingly at each other and admired the fine steps and enjoyed the whooping this went on until they were so tired they could hardly stand and had to stop to eat and rest
1274,8419-286667-0009.flac,and their long legs gave them a very genteel look the tops of their heads were covered with wardy red skin from which grew short black feathers that looked more like hairs one morning when the cranes awakened
1275,8419-286667-0030.flac,when did you think of it so they were married and missus sant hill crane often told her friends afterward that mister crane was so much in love with her that she just had to marry him they were very very happy and after a while
1276,8419-286667-0014.flac,she stood with her head on her breast and looked at the water after a while he trumpeted softly as though he were just trying his voice then she gave a pretty little start and said oh are you here how you did frighten me
1277,8419-286667-0005.flac,he would bend his body stretch out his neck open his long slender bill and swallow it at one gulp then he would seem to fall asleep again while most of the cranes were still feeding some of them were stalking through the woods and looking this way and that
1278,8419-286667-0013.flac,when they were eating the young fellow who had begun the dance stalked up to the sister of one of his friends as she stood in the edge of the pond gracefully balanced on one leg she did not turn her head towards him although having such a long and slender neck
1279,8419-286667-0027.flac,let us go off into the woods and rest you may be very sure he was glad to go and as he stalked off with her he led the way to a charming nesting place he didn't know just how to tell what he wanted to but he had seen another crane bowing to her
1280,8419-286667-0022.flac,he pitied short necked people then he said pooh i can take bigger mouthfuls than that you ought to see what bigg mouthfuls i can take she changed and stood on her other leg i saw you dancing this morning she said
1281,8419-286667-0015.flac,i am sorry he said i did not want to frighten you and he looked at her admiringly it was just for a minute she answered
1282,8419-286667-0024.flac,when a crane is as much excited as that it is pretty serious to my sister she asked carelessly as she drew one of her long tail feathers through her beak no said he i bowed to her sister
1283,8419-286667-0017.flac,then he thought that if she liked the place so well she might come there again the next day he wondered why he could not come too although everybody knows that a crane catches more if he fishes alone the next morning when the cranes danced
1284,8419-293473-0005.flac,do you ever fix a place for your eggs a place said the brown walking stick waving her long and slender feelers to and fro a place oh no i think they will hatch where they are it is too much trouble to find a place
1285,8419-293473-0004.flac,they said it was not genteel to hurry no matter what happened one day the tree frog was under the tree when the large brown walking stick decided to lay some eggs he saw her dropping them carelessly around on the ground and asked
1286,8419-293473-0013.flac,their feelers were held quite close together and they did not move their feet at all only swayed their bodies gracefully from side to side now they were on the ground hunting through the flat piles of cut grass for some fresh and juicy bits to eat
1287,8419-293473-0014.flac,the ants were scrambling around as busy as ever and life went on quite as though neither men nor horses had ever entered the meadow see cried a spider who was busily looking after her web there comes a horse drawing something and the farmer sitting on it and driving
1288,8419-293473-0001.flac,perhaps they were not happy with their relatives but then if one is a walking stick you know one does not care so very much about one's family these walking sticks had grown up the best way they could with no father or mother to care for them
1289,8419-293473-0002.flac,they had never been taught to do anything useful or to think much about other people when they were hungry they ate some leaves and never thought what they should eat the next time that they happened to be hungry when they were tired they went to sleep
1290,8419-293473-0020.flac,the walking sticks looked very uncomfortable and the brother and sister could not think of anything to say it was the young green one who spoke at last
1291,8419-293473-0000.flac,the dignified walking sticks three walking sticks from the forest had come to live in the big maple tree near the middle of the meadow nobody knew exactly why they had left the forest where all their sisters and cousins and aunts lived
1292,8419-293473-0018.flac,perhaps they can't help being fat but they might at least act genteel what is it to be genteel asked a grasshopper suddenly he had heard every word that the walking stick said why said the five legged walking stick
1293,8419-293473-0019.flac,it is just to be genteel to act as you see us act and to just here the hay tedder passed over them and every one of the walking sticks was sent flying through the air and landed on his back
1294,8419-293473-0006.flac,some others do not think it too much trouble to be careful where they lay eggs that may be said the brown walking stick but they do not belong to our family she spoke as if those who did not belong to her family might be good but could never be genteel
1295,8419-293473-0015.flac,when the horse was well into the meadow the farmer moved a bar and the queer looking machine began to kick the grass this way and that with its many stiff and shining legs a frisky young grasshopper kicked in the same way and happened just happened of course
1296,8419-293473-0016.flac,then there was a great scrambling and the crickets frolicked with them the young walking stick thought it looked like great fun and almost wished herself some other kind of insect so that she could tumble around in the same way she did not quite wish it you understand
1297,8419-293473-0017.flac,and would never have thought of it if she had turned brown ah said the five legged walking stick what scrambling how very common yes indeed said his sister why can't they learn to move slowly and gracefully
1298,8419-293473-0008.flac,the same long feelers and the same sort of long slender legs if you had passed them in a hay field you would surely have thought each a stem of hay unless you happened to see them move the other walking stick their friend was younger and green
1299,8419-293473-0010.flac,that was because he crawled into a clump of ferns and kept very still his sister came and looked at him and said now if you were only a spider it would not be long before you would have six legs again
1300,8419-293473-0011.flac,of course you know spiders never do have a hundred and the walking stick wouldn't be walking without any but that was just his way of speaking and it showed what kind of insect he was his relatives all waved their feelers one at a time and said
1301,8419-293473-0007.flac,she had once told her brother the five legged walking stick that she would not want to live if she could not be genteel she thought the meadow people very common the five legged walking stick looked much like his sister he had the same long slender body
1302,8419-293473-0009.flac,he knew just what to expect so when the nuthatch set him down on the bark to look at him he unhooked his feet from the bark and tumbled to the ground the nuthatch tried to catch him and broke off one of his legs but she never found him again although she looked and looked and looked and looked
1303,8419-293473-0003.flac,and when they had slept enough they awakened they had nothing to do but to eat and sleep and they did not often take the trouble to think they felt that they were a little better than those meadow people who rushed and scrambled and worked from morning until night and they showed very plainly how they felt
1304,8419-293473-0012.flac,ah he has the true walking stick spirit then they paid no more attention to him and after a while he and his sister and their green little friend left the forest for the meadow on the day when the grass was cut they had sat quietly in their trees and looked genteel
1305,8419-293469-0007.flac,oh how happy we were then i remember the day when my hind legs began to grow and how the other tadpoles crowded around me in the water and swam close to me to feel the two little bunches that were to be legs
1306,8419-293469-0017.flac,she picked me up and carried me inside oh how frightened i was my heart thumped as though it would burst and i tried my best to get away from her she didn't hurt me at all but she would not let me go
1307,8419-293469-0004.flac,one day when many of the meadow people were gathered around him he told them his story when i was a little fellow he said i was strong and well and could leap farther than any other frog of my size
1308,8419-293469-0019.flac,wonderful indeed and at the top continued the tree frog was something white over the doorway into my prison in the bottom where water and a stone and from the bottom to the top was a ladder
1309,8419-293469-0024.flac,but for a long time i could not sleep without dreaming that i was back in prison and i would croak in my sleep at the thought of it i heard you cried the katy did and i wondered what was the matter matter enough said the tree frog
1310,8419-293469-0021.flac,in the pleasant weather of course i went to the top of the ladder and when it was going to rain i would go down again every time that i went up or down those dreadful creatures would put their faces up close to my prison
1311,8419-293469-0002.flac,none of his friends had known him then but he was an honest fellow and they were sure that everything he told was true besides they must be true for how could a body everythink out such remarkable tales from his own head
1312,8419-293469-0020.flac,i had enough to eat but anybody who has been free cannot be happy shut in i watched my chance and three times i got out when the little door was not quite closed twice i was caught and put back
1313,8419-293469-0023.flac,after they stopped hunting the wind blew the door open and i hopped out you don't say exclaimed a grasshopper
1314,8419-293469-0008.flac,my fore legs did not grow until later and these bunches came just in front of my tail your tail cried a puzzled young cricket
1315,8419-293469-0018.flac,she put me in a very queer prison at first when she put me down on a stone in some water i did not know that i was in prison i tried to hop away and bump went my head against something
1316,8419-293469-0014.flac,the queerest thing about it was that the smaller creatures seemed to make the larger ones do whatever they wanted them to they even made some of them help do their work you may not believe me but what i tell you is true
1317,8419-293469-0003.flac,when he first came to his home by the elm tree he was very thin and looked as though he had been sick the katy dids who stayed near said that he croaked in his sleep and that you know is not what well and happy frogs should do
1318,8419-293469-0000.flac,in all the meadow there was nobody who could tell such interesting stories as the old tree frog even the garter snake who had been there the longest and the old cricket who had lived in the farmyard could tell no such exciting tales as the tree frog
1319,8419-293469-0010.flac,the knobs on the ends of my toes were sticky so that i could climb a tree and then i was ready to start on my travels some of the other frogs started with me but they stopped along the way and at last i was alone
1320,8419-293469-0013.flac,the largest creatures had four legs and some of them had horns the smaller creatures had only two legs on which to walk in two other limbs of some sort with which they lifted and carried things
1321,8419-293469-0009.flac,i did have when i was a tadpole said the tree frog i had a beautiful wiggly little tail with which to swim through the waters of the pond but as my legs grew larger and stronger my tail grew littler and weaker until there wasn't any tail left
1322,8419-293469-0015.flac,as you may guess i stayed there a long time watching these strange creatures work
1323,8419-293469-0001.flac,all the wonderful things of which he told had happened before he came to the meadow
1324,8419-293469-0022.flac,and i could hear a roaring sound which meant they were talking and laughing the last time i got out
1325,8419-293469-0025.flac,it makes my skin dry to think of it now and friends the best way i can ever repay your kindness to me is to tell you to never never never never go near the farmhouse and they all answered
1326,8419-293469-0011.flac,i was a bold young fellow and when i saw a great white thing among the trees up yonder i made up my mind to see what it was there was a great red thing in the yard beside it but i liked the white one better
1327,8419-293469-0016.flac,there were some bright colored flowers near the house and i crawled in among them there i rested until sunset and then began my evening song while i was singing one of the people from the house came out and found me
1328,8419-293469-0005.flac,i was hatched in the pond beyond the farmhouse and ate my way from the egg to the water outside like any other frog perhaps i ought to say like any other tadpole for of course i began life as a tadpole
1329,8419-293469-0012.flac,i hopped along as fast as i could for i did not then know enough to be afraid i got close up to them both and saw strange big creatures going in and out of the red thing the barn as i afterward found it was called
1330,8419-293469-0006.flac,i played and ate with my brothers and sisters and little dreamed what trouble was in store for me when i grew up we were all in a hurry to be frogs
1331,3699-19402-0011.flac,it became a violation of nature and was so far you see criminal it is for this reason and please your reverences that key holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes
1332,3699-19402-0007.flac,which having little or no meaning in them nature is ofttimes obliged to find one and as for my father's example twas so far from being either aiding or a betting thereunto
1333,3699-19402-0003.flac,whether itwas a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession my father who was all sensibilities from head to foot
1334,3699-19402-0022.flac,but not vapouringly and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement bid his honour never fear now my uncle toby did fear and grievously too
1335,3699-19402-0000.flac,could have vented such an insinuation he was however frank and generous in his nature and at all times open to conviction so that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort
1336,3699-19402-0016.flac,in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made by a total inactivity in my uncle toby's life for he seldom went further than the bowling green
1337,3699-19402-0004.flac,conscience redoubled her blow he turn'd his face suddenly the other way and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards by a cross movement of her right leg
1338,3699-19402-0005.flac,a thin blue chill pellucid crystal with all its humours so at rest the least moat or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of it had it existed
1339,3699-19402-0019.flac,a whiff of military pride had puff'd out his shirt at the wrist and upon that in a black leather thong clipp'd into a tassel beyond the knot hung the corporal's stick my uncle toby carried his cane
1340,3699-19402-0015.flac,and nature had moreover wrote gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance that even his tarnish'd gold laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffita became him
1341,3699-19402-0012.flac,though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle toby's great ramali wig into pipes yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk
1342,3699-19402-0010.flac,for certainly key holes were made for other purposes and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a key hole to be what it was
1343,3699-19402-0030.flac,a thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have said more for celibacy my uncle toby look'd earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling green
1344,3699-19402-0020.flac,like a pike it looks well at least quoth my father to himself
1345,3699-19402-0028.flac,when once a poor creature is in he is in and please your honour for ever tis very true said my uncle toby looking gravely at missus wadman's house as he spoke nothing
1346,3699-19402-0026.flac,your honour replied the corporal knows of tom's misfortunes but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this
1347,3699-19402-0029.flac,said my uncle toby musing whilst a man is free cried the corporal giving a flourish with his stick thus
1348,3699-19402-0024.flac,and yet excepting once that he was beguiled into it by missus wadman he had never look'd steadfastly into one and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart
1349,3699-19402-0001.flac,when his conscience smote him my mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted under his right in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his
1350,3699-19402-0021.flac,my uncle toby turn'd his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal and the corporal as oft as he did it gave a slight flourish with his stick
1351,3699-19402-0018.flac,and with his hair tuck'd up under his montero cap which he had furbish'd up for the occasion
1352,3699-19402-0025.flac,she cannot quoth my uncle toby halting when they had march'd up to within twenty paces of missus wadman's door she cannot corporal take it amiss
1353,3699-19402-0023.flac,infinite was his pity nor would the most courteous knight of romance have gone further at least upon one leg to have wiped away a tear from a woman's eye
1354,3699-19402-0013.flac,twould have cost her ladyship a smile it curled everywhere but where the corporal would have it and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it honour he could as soon have raised the dead
1355,3699-19402-0008.flac,that twas the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head nature had done her part to have spared him this trouble and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it
1356,3699-19402-0017.flac,and to shorten all description they shone so bright against the sun that morning and had so metallic and doughty in air with them that had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armour nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination
1357,3699-19402-0027.flac,that if tom had not married the widow or had it pleased god after their marriage that they had but put pork into their sausages the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed and dragg'd to the inquisition
1358,3699-19402-0009.flac,and here am i sitting this twelfth day of august seventeen sixty six in a purple jerkin and a yellow pair of slippers without either wig or cap on a most tragicomical completion of his prediction
1359,3699-19402-0006.flac,my mother madam was so at no time either by nature by institution or example a temperate current of blood ran orderly throgh her veins in all months of the year
1360,3699-19402-0002.flac,she raised her fingers and let them fall it could scarce be call'd a tap or if it was a tap
1361,3699-19402-0014.flac,such it was or rather such would it have seem'd upon any other brow but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle toby's assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself
1362,3699-175950-0000.flac,steath cried my great grandfather clapping his hand upon his nose
1363,3699-175950-0016.flac,brother didius tribonius will answer now tribonius the civilian and church lawyer's beard being three inches and a half and three eighth longer than didius his beard
1364,3699-175950-0001.flac,now my great grandfather's nose was for all the world like unto the noses of all the men women and children whom pantagruel found dwelling upon the island of ennyson
1365,3699-175950-0022.flac,but that was not thy transgression my dear uncle here but why here rather than in any other part of my story i am not able to tell but here it is my heart stops me
1366,3699-175950-0024.flac,devour'dst no man's bread gently with faithful trim behind thee didst thou amble round the little circle of thy pleasures jostling no creature in thy way for each one's sorrows thou hadst a tear
1367,3699-175950-0023.flac,whilst i am pouring forth the warmest sentiment of love for thee and veneration for the excellency of thy character that ever virtue and nature kindled in a nephew's bosom
1368,3699-175950-0007.flac,and feel pity for the force of education and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors for three generations at least this tenet in favour of long noses
1369,3699-175950-0002.flac,by the way if you would know the strange way of getting a kin among so flat nosed a people you must read the book find it out yourself you never can
1370,3699-175950-0015.flac,or when he chew'd it or when he roasted it or when he peel'd or when he brought it home or when he digested or when he for itis plain sir if the first picking up of the apple made it not his that no subsequent act could
1371,3699-175950-0012.flac,did he read such books and observe such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him change sides now my father as i told you last year detested all this he pick'd up an opinion sir
1372,3699-175950-0005.flac,as soon as ever he enter'd upon the odd fifty he generally gave a loud hem
1373,3699-175950-0004.flac,so that my father had the jointure to pay a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly on michelmas and lady day during all that time no man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father
1374,3699-175950-0017.flac,that the sweat of a man's brows and the excudations of a man's brains are as much a man's own property as the breeches upon his back side
1375,3699-175950-0025.flac,for each man's need thou hadst a shilling whilst i am worth one to pay a weeder thy path from thy door to thy bowlingreen shall never be grown up
1376,3699-175950-0006.flac,inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the call of his wig look'd at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples
1377,3699-175950-0020.flac,by the trotting of my lean horse the thing is incredible and i am quite lost in my understanding when i am considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon worse subjects
1378,3699-175950-0009.flac,that he did not conceive how the greatest family in england could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses and for the contrary reason he would generally add
1379,3699-175950-0021.flac,what was to be had however he set the greater store by and though my father would ofttime sport with my uncle toby's library which by the bye was ridiculous enough
1380,3699-175950-0011.flac,i mean the external organ of smelling or that part of man which stands prominent in his face and which painters say in good jolly noses and well proportioned faces should comprehend a full third that is measured downwards from the setting on of the hair
1381,3699-175950-0010.flac,that it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life where the same number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct line
1382,3699-175950-0019.flac,would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on and in a word would intrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breastworks as my uncle toby would a citadel
1383,3699-175950-0003.flac,you must mean your uncle's replied my great grandmother my great grandfather was convinced he untwisted the paper and signed the article
1384,3699-175950-0013.flac,as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple it becomes his own and if he is a man of spirit he would lose his life rather than give it up
1385,3699-175950-0018.flac,they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting as in the case above so that they might well and truly be said to be of his own goods and chattels accordingly he held fast by em both by teeth and claws
1386,3699-175950-0014.flac,the apple is as much frank's apple as john's pray mister shandy what patent has he to shew for it and how did it begin to be his was it when he set his heart upon it or when he gathered it
1387,3699-175950-0008.flac,so that the whimsicality of my father's brain was far from having the whole honour of this as it had of almost all his other strange notions for in a great measure he might be said to have suck'd this in with his mother's milk
1388,3699-19401-0026.flac,but the account of this is worth more than to be wove into the fag and of the eighth alluding to the first edition volume of such a work as this
1389,3699-19401-0004.flac,into a cors no matter whether he loves the service or no being once in it he acts as if he did and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowess
1390,3699-19401-0006.flac,for this reason continued my father stating the case over again notwithstanding all the world knows that missus wadman affects my brother toby and my brother toby contrariwise affects missus wadman
1391,3699-19401-0012.flac,by falling in love with a popish clergy woman said trim twas a begine said my uncle toby doctor slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction
1392,3699-19401-0024.flac,whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions my uncle toby and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack as the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside at least for the present
1393,3699-19401-0019.flac,once at least every four or five days but ofter if convenient lest in taking off thy wig before her thro absence of mind she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by time how much by trim
1394,3699-19401-0000.flac,my father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations thrusting and ripping and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn
1395,3699-19401-0002.flac,they are as rotten as dirt said the corporal then by all means said my father bespeak a new pair brother for though i know continued my father turning himself to the company
1396,3699-19401-0014.flac,and perhaps it is as well for thee tho not so well for me that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head and that i am able to write it to thee had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots
1397,3699-19401-0025.flac,there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning so accordingly it was resolv'd upon for eleven o'clock
1398,3699-19401-0022.flac,they are all books which excite laughter and thou knowest dear toby that there is no passion so serious as lust stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou enter'st her parlour
1399,3699-19401-0021.flac,for this cause if thou canst help it never throw down the tongs and procher avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her
1400,3699-19401-0013.flac,and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter skelter upon the whole order of nuns and begines a set of silly fusty baggages slop could not stand it and my uncle toby having some measures to take about his breeches
1401,3699-19401-0009.flac,now trim's montero cap as i once told you was his constant wager and having furbish'd it up that very night in order to go upon the attack it made the odds look more considerable
1402,3699-19401-0020.flac,whatever thou hast to say be it more or less forget not to utter it in a low soft tone of voice silence and whatever approaches it weades dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain
1403,3699-19401-0018.flac,without first recommending thyself to the protection of almighty god that he may defend thee from the evil one shave the whole top of thy crown clean
1404,3699-19401-0011.flac,that widow wadman and please your worship cannot hold it out ten days and whence cried slop jeeringly hast thou all this knowledge of woman friend
1405,3699-19401-0017.flac,yet i would remind thee of one during the continuance of thy courtship in a particular manner which i would not have omitted and that is never to go forth upon the enterprise whether it be in the morning or the afternoon
1406,3699-19401-0015.flac,missus shandy being now close beside me preparing for bed i have thrown together without order and just as they have come into my mind such hints and documents as i deem may be of use to thee
1407,3699-19401-0008.flac,we have taken our measures badly quoth my uncle toby looking up interrogatively in trim's face i would lay my montero cap said trim
1408,3699-19401-0001.flac,for that the tailor in ripping them up in order to turn them had found they had been turn'd before then turn them again brother said my father rapidly for there will be many a turning of hem yet before all's done in the affair
1409,3699-19401-0005.flac,the hypothesis like the rest of my father's was plausible enough and my uncle toby had but a single word to object to it in which trim stood ready to second him but my father had not drawn his conclusion
1410,3699-19401-0023.flac,there is nothing further for thee which occurs to me at present unless the breaking out of a fresh war so wishing every thing dear toby for best i rest thy affectionate brother walter shandy
1411,3699-19401-0007.flac,and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night yet will i answer for it that this self same tune will not be play'd this twelvemonth
1412,3699-19401-0010.flac,i would lay and please your honour my montero cap to a shilling was it proper continued trim making a bow to offer a wager before your honours there is nothing improper in it said my father
1413,3699-19401-0016.flac,though i perceive from a glow in my cheek that i blush as i begin to speak to thee upon the subject as well knowing notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy how few of its offices thou neglect'st
1414,3699-19401-0003.flac,that widow wadman has been deeply in love with my brother toby for many years and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion yet now that she has caught him her fever will be past its height
1415,3699-47246-0018.flac,was difficult to be met with at watering places which were already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauties and were chiefly stocked with men whose whiskers might be dyed and whose incomes were still more problematic
1416,3699-47246-0019.flac,so she had determined on trying a neighbourhood where people were extremely well acquainted with each other's affairs and where the women were mostly ill dressed and ugly
1417,3699-47246-0003.flac,and which would be utterly overturn'd and nullified by the destruction of that premiss missus phipps the banker's wife and missus lander the attorney's wife had invested part of their reputation for acuteness
1418,3699-47246-0024.flac,why it must lie in the possession of some vices from which they were undeniably free hence it came to pass that milby respectability refused to recognize the countess czerlaski
1419,3699-47246-0027.flac,and shuns a coldly satirical eye as she would shun a gorgon and she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship not merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society
1420,3699-47246-0028.flac,and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that quarter she had serious intentions of becoming quite pious without any reserves when she had once got her carriage and settlement
1421,3699-47246-0012.flac,of the smallest description indeed he would not have ventured to call it his own he might be slightly recalcitrant now and then as is the habit of long ear'd packiderms under the thong of the fair countess's tongue
1422,3699-47246-0015.flac,whom he initiated into the mysteries of the pas debas and the lances quadriles she had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with czerlaski who had taken her to paris and germany
1423,3699-47246-0031.flac,thus there was really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and attentions to mister and missus barton
1424,3699-47246-0006.flac,miss phipps for her part didn't like dressing for effect she had always avoided that style of appearance which was calculated to create a sensation
1425,3699-47246-0026.flac,so she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighbourhood where people are well acquainted with each other's private affairs
1426,3699-47246-0004.flac,had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the other lady's manifest superiority in personal charms miss phipp's stumpy figure and unsuccessful attire
1427,3699-47246-0007.flac,then what amusing innuendoes of the milby gentlemen over their wine would have been entirely frustrated and reduced to naught if you had told them that the countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanours which demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society
1428,3699-47246-0020.flac,and give him at least a sort of cousinship to the quarter sessions all this which was the simple truth would have seem'd extremely flat to the gossips of milby who had made up their minds to something much more exciting
1429,3699-47246-0032.flac,still their friendship by no means adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to milby and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother
1430,3699-47246-0010.flac,mister bridmain in fact quadrugenaryan bachelor as he was felt extremely well pleased to receive his sister in her widowhood and to shine in the reflected light of her beauty and title
1431,3699-47246-0021.flac,there was nothing here so very detestable it is true the countess was a little vain a little ambitious a little selfish a little shallow and frivolous a little given to white lies but
1432,3699-47246-0016.flac,not indeed any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom but much external polish and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind
1433,3699-47246-0013.flac,and there was always the possibility that mister bridmain's first nuptials might occur before the countess was quite sure of her second as it was however he submitted to all his sister's caprices
1434,3699-47246-0029.flac,the countess did not quote sophocles but she said to herself only this little bit of pretence and vanity and then i will be quite good and make myself quite safe for another world
1435,3699-47246-0002.flac,besides think of all the virtuous declamation all the penetrating observation which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position that the countess was a very objectionable person indeed
1436,3699-47246-0022.flac,who considers such slight blemishes such moral pimples as these disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society indeed
1437,3699-47246-0008.flac,had subsequently given dancing lessons in the metropolis that mister bridmain was neither more nore less than her half brother who by unimpeached integrity and industry
1438,3699-47246-0000.flac,chapter four i am by no means sure that if the good people of milby had known the truth about the countess czerlaski they would not have been considerably disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined
1439,3699-47246-0001.flac,nice distinctions are troublesome it is so much easier to say that a thing is black than to discriminate the particular shade of brown blue or green to which it really belongs
1440,3699-47246-0005.flac,instead of looking down from a mount of virtue with an aureole round its head would then be seen on the same level and in the same light as the countess czerlaski's diana like farm and well chosen drapery
1441,3699-47246-0011.flac,every man who is not a monster a mathematician or a mad philosopher is the slave of some woman or other mister bridmain had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister and thoug his soul was a very little one
1442,3699-47246-0023.flac,the severest ladies in milby would have been perfectly aware that these characteristics would have created no wide distinction between the countess czerlaski and themselves and since it was clear there was a wide distinction
1443,3699-47246-0017.flac,one of these conclusions was that there were things more solid in life than fine whiskers and title and that in accepting a second husband
1444,3699-47246-0025.flac,in spite of her assiduous church going and the deep disgust she was known to have expressd at the extreme pausity of the congregations on ash wedenesdays
1445,3699-47246-0030.flac,for you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the countess was absorbingly devoted and to whose desires she made every thing else subservient namely caroline czerlaski nay bridmain
1446,3699-47246-0014.flac,as personages on the debatable ground between aristocracy and commonality instead of settling in some spot where his five hundred a year might have won him the definite dignity of a parochial magnate
1447,3699-47246-0009.flac,had won a partnership in a silk manufactory and thereby a moderate fortune that enabled him to retire as you see to study politics the weather and the art of conversation at his leisure
1448,229-130880-0017.flac,the englishman percival made much of a kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface but i find that hard to believe
1449,229-130880-0068.flac,the canadian said no my friend that task is performed with eleven strainers or sieves that are pierced with different numbers of holes those pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first order
1450,229-130880-0085.flac,conseil put in and why not what good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the nautilus here no ned land said but elsewhere oh elsewhere conseil put in
1451,229-130880-0086.flac,shaking his head in fact i said mister land is right and if we ever brought back to europe or america a pearlworth millions it would make the story of our adventures more authentic and much more rewarding that's how i see it
1452,229-130880-0062.flac,first they remove the layers of mother of pearl which are known in the industry by the names legitimate silver bastard white or bastard black
1453,229-130880-0008.flac,who went out immediately soon the nautilus re entered its liquid element and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet with the chart under my eyes
1454,229-130880-0076.flac,conseil replied but when a little glass of vinegar is worth one million five hundred thousand francs its taste is a small price to pay
1455,229-130880-0046.flac,all right sit down my friends
1456,229-130880-0003.flac,its length is two hundred seventy five miles its maximum width one hundred fifty miles its circumference nine hundred miles its surface area twenty four thousand four hundred forty eight square miles
1457,229-130880-0090.flac,the canadian replied i'm a professional harpooner it's my job to make a mockery of them it isn't an issue i said of fishing for them with a swivelhook hoisting them on to a deck of a ship
1458,229-130880-0006.flac,certainly captain fine it's easily done only when we see the fisheries we'll see no fishermen
1459,229-130880-0071.flac,these ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of three million man eaters francs conseil rebuked yes francs three million francs i went on
1460,229-130880-0009.flac,i found it by the ninth parallel off the northwestern shores of ceylon
1461,229-130880-0084.flac,conseil said quickly yes i said two million francs and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up ha ned land exclaimed during our stroll to morrow who says we won't run into one just like it
1462,229-130880-0073.flac,but now they bring in only two thirds of that amount all in all it's estimated that nine million francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl harvesting industry but conseil asked
1463,229-130880-0060.flac,but will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls one proceeds in several ways and often when pearls stick to the valves fishermen even pull them loose with pliers
1464,229-130880-0031.flac,hunting otters in underwater forests as we did in the forest of crespo island is an acceptable activity
1465,229-130880-0074.flac,haven't certain famous pearls been quoted at extremely high prices yes my boy
1466,229-130880-0045.flac,conseil said to me give us some background on pearl fishing on the fishing itself i asked or on the occupational hazards that on the fishing the canadian replied before we tackle the turraine it helps to be familiar with it
1467,229-130880-0078.flac,i even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancee kate tender but she married somebody else instead
1468,229-130880-0022.flac,it's even said that in eighteen fourteen when the english government went fishing on its own behalf its divers worked just twenty days and brought up seventy six million oysters
1469,229-130880-0036.flac,thank heavens i said to myself conseil will never want to come along and that will be my excuse for not going with the captain as for ned land i admit i felt less confident of his wisdom
1470,229-130880-0087.flac,the canadian said but said conseil who perpetually returned to the didactic side of things is this pearl fishing ever dangerous no i replied quickly especially if one takes certain precautions
1471,229-130880-0061.flac,thus they die in the open air and by the end of ten days they've rotted sufficiently next they're immersed in huge tanks of salt water then they're opened up and washed at this point the sorters begin their twofold task
1472,229-130880-0040.flac,for a visit to morrow to ceylon's magnificent pearl fisheries he did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman he didn't tell you anything else nothing sir the canadian replied
1473,229-130880-0035.flac,and how i resented the off hand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation
1474,229-130880-0041.flac,he said you'd already discussed this little stroll indeed i said but didn't he give you any details on not a one mister naturalist you will be going with us right me
1475,229-130880-0075.flac,i've even heard stories the canadian said about some lady in ancient times who drank pearls and vinegar cleopatra conseil shot back it must have tasted pretty bad ned land added abominable ned my friend
1476,229-130880-0091.flac,opening the belly ripping out the heart and tossing it into the sea so it's an issue of yes precisely in the water in the water ye gods just give me a good harpoon
1477,229-130880-0047.flac,ned and conseil took seats on a couch and right off the canadian said to me sir just what is a pearl exactly my gallant ned i replied for poets a pearl is a teer from the sea
1478,229-130880-0072.flac,but i don't think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did similarly the central american fisheries
1479,229-130880-0005.flac,is famous for its pearl fisheries would you be interested professor aronax
1480,229-130880-0056.flac,on the valves a pearl sticks fast on the flesh it lies loose but its nucleus is always some small hard object say a sterile egg or a grain of sand
1481,229-130880-0023.flac,the fishermen are well paid aren't they hardly professor in panama they make just one dollar per week in most places they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl and they bring up so many that have none
1482,229-130880-0037.flac,danger however great held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature i went back to reading sir's book but i leafed through it mechanically between the lines i kept seeing fearsome wide open jaws
1483,229-130880-0089.flac,by the way gallant ned are you afraid of sharks
1484,229-130880-0014.flac,that such primitive methods are still all that they use all
1485,229-130880-0044.flac,for my part i stared at them with anxious eyes as if they were already missing a limb or two should i alert them yes surely but i hardly knew how to go about it would master
1486,229-130880-0063.flac,then they remove the oyster's mety tissue boil it and finally strain it in order to extract even the smallest pearls do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size conseil asked not only on their size i replied
1487,229-130880-0020.flac,their vision weakens ulcers break out on their eyes swores form on their bodies and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor yes i said it's a sad occupation
1488,229-130880-0079.flac,but you can absolutely trust me on this professor its pearls were so big
1489,229-130880-0001.flac,that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula i went looking in the library for a book about this island one of the most fertile in the world sure enough i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singales
1490,229-130880-0019.flac,i believe the average time under water that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose
1491,229-130880-0027.flac,the rest of us captain nemo answered and in time you will be too anyhow we'll be armed and on our way we might hunt a man eater or two it's a fascinating sport so professor i'll see you to morrow
1492,229-130880-0032.flac,that's another story i know that in certain countries particularly the andamen islands negroes don't hesitate to attack sharks dagger in one hand and noose in the other
1493,229-130880-0055.flac,that valuable shellfish pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape either they stick to the oyster's shell or they become embedded in the creature's folds
1494,229-130880-0013.flac,dive in rotation and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat you mean i said
1495,229-130880-0038.flac,just then conseil and the canadian entered with a calm even gleeful air little did they know what was waiting for them ye god sir ned land told me your captain nemo the devil take him
1496,229-130880-0052.flac,turbal snails giant clams and salt water scallops briefly all those that secrete mother of pearl in other words that blue azure violet or white substance
1497,229-130880-0011.flac,the seas of china and japan plus those seas south of the united states the gulf of panama and the gulf of california but it's off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards no doubt we'll be arriving a little early
1498,229-130880-0081.flac,that essence of orient must sell for quite a large sum as little as zero it comes from the scales of a european carp it's nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia it's worthless
1499,229-130880-0004.flac,in other words a little smaller than that of ireland just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared the captain glanced at the chart then turning to me the island of ceylon he said
1500,229-130880-0030.flac,you might want to think it over before accepting as for me i passed a hand over my brow where beads of cold sweat were busy forming let's think this over i said to myself and let's take our time
1501,229-130880-0058.flac,they even mention one oyster about which i remain dubious
1502,229-130880-0015.flac,although these fisheries belong to the most industrialized people in the world the english
1503,229-130880-0083.flac,this one conseil said pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case exactly and i'm certainly not far off when i estimate its value at two million a francs
1504,229-130880-0069.flac,those not slipping through the sieves pierced with one hundred to eight hundred holes are in the second order finally those pearls for which one uses strainers pierced with nine hundred to one thousand holes make up the seed pearls
1505,229-130880-0048.flac,for orientals it's a drop of solidified dew for the ladies it's a jewel
1506,229-130880-0066.flac,the pear shaped ones into ear rings and since they're the most valuable they're priced individually the other pearls that stick to the oyster's shell are more erradically shaped and are priced by weight finally classed in the lowest order
1507,229-130880-0053.flac,lining the insides of their valves are mussels included too the canadian asked yes the mussels of certain streams in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france
1508,229-130880-0054.flac,good the canadian replied from now on we'll pay closer attention to em but i went on for secreting pearls the ideal mullusk is the pearl oyster melagrina margaritafera
1509,229-130880-0067.flac,the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls their priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments but it must be a long hard job sorting out these pearls by size
1510,229-130880-0070.flac,how ingenious conseil said to reduce dividing and classifying pearls to a mechanical operation and could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters according to sir's book i replied
1511,229-130880-0082.flac,maybe that's why kate tender married somebody else replied mister land philosophically but i said getting back to pearls of great value i don't think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by captain nemo
1512,229-130880-0065.flac,they form an isolation within the mollusk's tissue theyre white often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency and usually spherical or pear shaped the spherical ones are made into bracelets
1513,229-130880-0034.flac,and there i was fantasising about sharks invisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man and half i could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle
1514,229-130880-0024.flac,only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich that's atrocious on that note professor captain nemo told me
1515,229-130880-0057.flac,around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin concentric layers over several years in succession can one find several pearls in the same oyster conseil asked yes my boy
1516,229-130880-0007.flac,and we'll arrive there late to night
1517,229-130880-0049.flac,necks and ears that's oblong in shape glassiin lustre and formed from mother of pearl for chemists it's a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protine
1518,229-130880-0039.flac,has just made us a very pleasant proposition oh i said you know about with all due respect to master conseil replied the nautilus's commander has invited us together with master
1519,229-130880-0018.flac,i know that some divers can last up to fifty seven seconds and highly skilful ones to eighty seven but such men are rare
1520,229-130880-0051.flac,asephala order tesasea correct my scholarly conseil now then those tesasea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abylone
1521,229-130880-0025.flac,and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early well we can watch him at work that suits me captain by the way professor aronnax you aren't afraid of sharks are you sharks i exclaimed
1522,229-130880-0050.flac,and finally for naturalists it's a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother of pearl in certain bivalves branch molessa conseil said class
1523,229-130880-0026.flac,this struck me as a pretty needless question to say the least well captain nemo went on i admit captain i'm not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish we're used to them
1524,229-130880-0043.flac,dangerous ned land replied a simple trip to an oyster bank assuredly
1525,229-130880-0033.flac,but i also know that many who face those fearsome animals don't come back alive besides i'm not a negro and even if i were a negro in this instance i don't think a little hesitation on my part would be out of place
1526,229-130880-0010.flac,to reach it we had to go all the way up saylon's west coast professor captain nemo then told me there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal the seas of the east indies
1527,229-130880-0093.flac,well how about you conseil what are your feelings about these man eaters me conseil said i'm afraid i must be frank with master good for you i thought
1528,229-130880-0092.flac,you see sir these sharks are badly designed they have to roll their bellies over to snap you up and in the meantime ned land had a way of pronouncing the word snap
1529,229-130880-0012.flac,only during the month of march and for thirty days some three hundred boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen the latter divided into two groups
1530,229-130880-0000.flac,right off i observed a cluster of mountains about two thousand feet high whose shapes were very whimsically sculptred after our position fix i re entered the lounge and when our bearings were reported on the chart i saw that we were off the island of ceylon
1531,229-130880-0021.flac,and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion but tell me captain how many oysters can a boat fish up in a work day
1532,229-130880-0028.flac,bright and early this said in a care free tone captain nemo left the lounge if you're invited to hunt bears in the swiss mountains you might say oh good i get to go bear hunting to morrow
1533,229-130880-0029.flac,if you're invited to hunt lions on the atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of india you might say ha now's my chance to hunt lions and tigers but if you're invited to hunt sharks in their native element
1534,229-130880-0077.flac,ned land married to cleopatra conseil exclaimed but i was all set to tie the knot conseil the canadian replied in all seriousness
1535,229-130880-0042.flac,why yes certainly of course i can see that you like the idea mister land yes it will be a really unusual experience and possibly dangerous i added in an insinuating tone
1536,229-130880-0016.flac,yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work yes since those poor fishermen can't stay long under water on his voyage to ceylon
1537,229-130880-0080.flac,my gallant ned i replied laughing those were artificial pearls ordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with essence of orient wow
1538,229-130880-0059.flac,ned land yelped did i say sharks i exclaimed hastily i meant an hundred fifty pearls sharks wouldn't make cense indeed conseil said
1539,229-130880-0002.flac,reentering the lounge i first noted the bearings of ceylon on which antiquity lavished so many different names
1540,229-130880-0064.flac,but also according to their shape their water in other words their color and their orient in other words that dappled shimmering glow that makes them so delightful to the eye the finest pearls are called virgin pearls or paragons
1541,229-130880-0088.flac,what risks would you run in a job like that ned land said swallowing a few gulps of salt water whatever you say ned then trying to imitate captain nemo's carefree tone i asked
1542,60-121082-0093.flac,i hope i am not the cause hush said andrea they passed the barrier without accident at the first cross street
1543,60-121082-0091.flac,he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself but tell me said andrea
1544,60-121082-0055.flac,as you say just now you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate
1545,60-121082-0035.flac,at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier
1546,60-121082-0054.flac,that is not right take care or i may become troublesome this menace smothered the young man's passion he urged the horse again into a trot
1547,60-121082-0028.flac,he asked pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you you have no right to beg at night
1548,60-121082-0032.flac,i can scarcely stand the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity tell me he said tell me what you want well then
1549,60-121082-0067.flac,there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alone well be it so then
1550,60-121082-0071.flac,so far i have appeared to answer his purpose and who found this father for you the count of monte cristo
1551,60-121082-0056.flac,i am young and wilful between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged is it my fault if fortune
1552,60-121082-0025.flac,torn an filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man's shoulder
1553,60-121082-0037.flac,i'll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horse's bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him
1554,60-121082-0086.flac,who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need
1555,60-121082-0024.flac,and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals a red handkerchief encircled his gray head
1556,60-121082-0023.flac,and had returned just as they were starting but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles
1557,60-121082-0041.flac,andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now
1558,60-121082-0030.flac,i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want
1559,60-121082-0094.flac,well said andrea
1560,60-121082-0007.flac,amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king's attorney then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son
1561,60-121082-0074.flac,yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true
1562,60-121082-0047.flac,come come what then patience patience i am patient but go on
1563,60-121082-0015.flac,by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words
1564,60-121082-0062.flac,he is not a prince simply a count a count and a rich one too eh yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman
1565,60-121082-0085.flac,where it began playing with a pistol but meanwhile
1566,60-121082-0036.flac,there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprise groom retired let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea oh as for that
1567,60-121082-0070.flac,a real father yes so long as he pays me you'll honor and believe him that's right what is his name major cavalcanti
1568,60-121082-0002.flac,as for m danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing
1569,60-121082-0031.flac,speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you
1570,60-121082-0077.flac,do you think so m bossett and you
1571,60-121082-0029.flac,said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew
1572,60-121082-0083.flac,and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital andrea scowled certainly
1573,60-121082-0087.flac,the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another andrea's hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time
1574,60-121082-0027.flac,or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly
1575,60-121082-0005.flac,had offered him a seat in his carriage andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion
1576,60-121082-0038.flac,don't think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no it's only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you
1577,60-121082-0039.flac,come step in said the young man it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury
1578,60-121082-0052.flac,you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did
1579,60-121082-0082.flac,this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and that i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean then i should become simply
1580,60-121082-0013.flac,by declaring in what lake the best lamprees were caught then he had eaten some without saying a word more
1581,60-121082-0011.flac,were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker's servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon one thing above all the rest heightened the respect
1582,60-121082-0089.flac,but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion it seems to me
1583,60-121082-0045.flac,that you are mistaken well well don't be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous
1584,60-121082-0059.flac,rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me you wrong me my boy now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone knowing as i do
1585,60-121082-0061.flac,what an appetite you used to have is it as good now oh yes replied andrea laughing
1586,60-121082-0033.flac,i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back andrea turned pale but said nothing
1587,60-121082-0009.flac,he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major's little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available ascit
1588,60-121082-0042.flac,let me ask you why you deceived me how have i deceived you how do you ask
1589,60-121082-0066.flac,but that with with with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy here are two hundred said andrea
1590,60-121082-0018.flac,and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars
1591,60-121082-0001.flac,was the first to give the signal of departure he offered a seat in his landow to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife
1592,60-121082-0096.flac,and running into a court he disappeared alas said andrea sighing
1593,60-121082-0049.flac,i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you
1594,60-121082-0078.flac,a peer of france ah said andrea who knows major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished
1595,60-121082-0057.flac,has been kind to me fortune has been kind to you then your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired good
1596,60-121082-0043.flac,but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea
1597,60-121082-0092.flac,it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said cavalcanti
1598,60-121082-0060.flac,the goodness of your heart if you have two coats you will give me one of them i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry true said andrea
1599,60-121082-0006.flac,was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron grey horse andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people
1600,60-121082-0063.flac,o be easy i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself but
1601,60-121082-0064.flac,you must pay for it you understand well
1602,60-121082-0008.flac,and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabab come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir
1603,60-121082-0048.flac,you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you
1604,60-121082-0072.flac,the man whose house you have just left yes
1605,60-121082-0026.flac,and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury
1606,60-121082-0084.flac,as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket
1607,60-121082-0050.flac,you speak to me before my servant how can i help that my boy i speak to you when i can catch you you have a quick horse a light tilbury
1608,60-121082-0016.flac,to morrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you
1609,60-121082-0044.flac,you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses
1610,60-121082-0088.flac,he said how happy you will be i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont dugard shutting up his knife well then we will go to paris
1611,60-121082-0003.flac,he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice
1612,60-121082-0053.flac,with his unpleasant smile it was very polite of you come said andrea what do you want you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend
1613,60-121082-0046.flac,i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or pidmont by acting as facino or ciceron and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own you know i always did call you my child
1614,60-121082-0051.flac,you are naturally as slippery as an eel if i had missed you to night i might not have had another chance
1615,60-121082-0095.flac,you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do you oh you are young while i am beginning to get old aurevoir benedetto
1616,60-121082-0075.flac,well i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the paper in the cafe then in the evening i shall go to the theatre
1617,60-121082-0080.flac,how not at all why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes
1618,60-121082-0012.flac,nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge
1619,60-121082-0034.flac,yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto
1620,60-121082-0076.flac,i shall look like some retired baker that is what i want come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better
1621,60-121082-0004.flac,without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel chateau renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m de villefort's carriage danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti
1622,60-121082-0040.flac,andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle
1623,60-121082-0069.flac,but tell me all about it why do you wish to know asked cavalcanti what do you again defy me no the fact is i have found my father what
1624,60-121082-0022.flac,who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step at that moment a hand touched his shoulder the young man turned round
1625,60-121082-0014.flac,danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england
1626,60-121082-0073.flac,since he holds the money chest well i will mention you to him meanwhile what are you going to do
1627,60-121082-0020.flac,as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus
1628,60-121082-0021.flac,giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea
1629,60-121082-0090.flac,we shall see he then took the great coat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcanti's hat which he placed upon his own head and finally
1630,60-121082-0058.flac,his eyes sparkling with avarice oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head
1631,60-121082-0017.flac,if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages
1632,60-121082-0065.flac,i think that with a hundred francs a month well i could live upon a hundred francs come you understand me
1633,60-121082-0079.flac,and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear
1634,60-121082-0019.flac,who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son sixty thousand francs a year
1635,60-121082-0068.flac,take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours come come i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you
1636,60-121082-0000.flac,the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced on his wife's request m de villefort
1637,60-121082-0010.flac,then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his forty eight thousand francs
1638,60-121082-0081.flac,what was there before making in all about two hundred francs why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money
1639,1578-6379-0043.flac,young wait till you see me with my hair done up
1640,1578-6379-0036.flac,talking to men did you tell the dowager yes i told her about getting the wrong suit case i didn't mention the fact that it belonged to the third man from the end what did she say she said it was very careless of me to run off with a strange man's luggage
1641,1578-6379-0014.flac,and things where d'd you get it well said patty languidly it's a long story
1642,1578-6379-0032.flac,the man who took me into dinner never dreamed that i hadn't been out for years and you know he tried to flirt with me he did really and he was getting awfully old he must have been almost forty i felt as though i were flirting with my grandfather you know patty added it isn't so bad being grown up
1643,1578-6379-0013.flac,is it locked yes patty nodded but my key will open it
1644,1578-6379-0027.flac,what's the matter with it she just waved her hand toward the table and didn't say a word and there it was wide open patty took a key from her pocket unlocked the suit case and threw back the lid a man's dress suit was neatly folded on the top with a pipe a box of cigarettes some collars
1645,1578-6379-0046.flac,while the others in a flutter of excitement thrust in the coat and relocked the suit case they crowded after her in a body and hung over the banisters at a perilous angle straining their ears in the direction of the drawing room nothing but a murmur of voices floated up
1646,1578-6379-0033.flac,before patty resumed her chronicle and uncle tom made me tell about the suit case at the dinner table everybody laughed it made a very exciting story i told them about the whole school going to the glee club and falling in love in a body with the third man from the end
1647,1578-6379-0021.flac,oh conny murmured disappointedly then what happened priscilla asked nothing at all i got out at coomsdale and uncle tom met me with the automobile the chauffeur took my suit case from the porter and i didn't see it near too at all we reached the house just at tea time
1648,1578-6379-0022.flac,and i went straight into tea without going upstairs the butler took up my suit case and the maid came and asked for the key so she could unpack the house is simply running over with servants i'm always scared to death
1649,1578-6379-0006.flac,there it is take it upstairs i'll be with you as soon as i've reported but that isn't your suit case patty shook her head mysteriously if you tried a thousand years you'd never guess who owns it who patty laughed
1650,1578-6379-0035.flac,but you didn't leave it i came on the other road i'm going to send it down and what did you wear at the wedding louise's clothes it didn't matter a bit my not matching the other bridesmaids because i was maid of honor and ought to dress differently anyway i've been grown up for three days
1651,1578-6379-0020.flac,except german hiliard junior and he followed me right into the parlor car and sat down in the chair exactly opposite patty they cried in shocked chorus you surely didn't speak to him
1652,1578-6379-0030.flac,uncle tom lives five miles from town and there simply wasn't anything we could do that night and just imagined his feelings when he started to dress for the concert and found patty's new pink evening gown spread out on top suggested priscilla oh patty
1653,1578-6379-0016.flac,when we got in it was cram full of men the entire yale glee club was going to the station there were so many of them that they were sitting in each other's laps the whole top layer rose and said perfectly gravely and politely madame take my seat
1654,1578-6379-0008.flac,miss jellings was insistent that recreation should be actively pursued out of doors the two could easily have obtained permission to greet patty's return inside but it was the policy of the trio never to ask permission in minor matters it wasted one's credit unnecessarily
1655,1578-6379-0038.flac,everyone who passed number seven dropped in to hear the news each in turn received the story of the suit case and each in turn
1656,1578-6379-0017.flac,ma'amselle was outraged she said in french which of course they all understood that she thought american college boys had disgraceful manners but i smiled a little i couldn't help it they were so funny and then two of the bottom ones offered their seats and we sat down
1657,1578-6379-0029.flac,he telephoned to the station but they didn't know anything about it
1658,1578-6379-0007.flac,just a little souvenir that i picked up i'll tell you as soon as i've interviewed the dowager hurry and slip in while jelly isn't looking they cast a quick glance over their shoulders toward the gymnasium instructor who was arguing fat irene mc cullagh into faster movements on the tennis court
1659,1578-6379-0015.flac,i think you're beastly well the glee club was last thursday night
1660,1578-6379-0018.flac,and you'll never believe it but the third man from the end was sitting right next to me not really oh patty is he as good looking near to as he was on the stage better are those his real eyebrows or were they blacked
1661,1578-6379-0048.flac,they gazed with wide horrified eyes and turned without a word to meet patty as she trudged upstairs lugging her errant suit case a glance told her that they had seen and dropping on the top step she leaned her head against the railing and laughed
1662,1578-6379-0039.flac,doesn't it smell tobaccoee and bay rummish said rosalie patten sniffing oh there's a button loose cried florence hissop the careful housewife where's some black silk patty she threaded a needle and secured the button then she daringly tried on the coat
1663,1578-6379-0034.flac,and how we all cut his picture out of the programe and pasted it in our watches and then about my sitting across from him in the train and changing suit cases mister harper the man next to me said it was the most romantic thing he had ever heard in his life that louise's marriage was nothing to it
1664,1578-6379-0003.flac,as they came to a stop they were besieged by a crowd of blue coated girls it was afternoon recreation and the whole school was abroad the welcome that she received would have led an onlooker to infer that patty had been gone three months instead of three days she and her two
1665,1578-6379-0005.flac,they swarmed over the driver's seat an the steps and two equestriens even perched themselves on the horse's backs what's the adventure demanded conny and priscilla in a breath as the cavalcade rattled off patty waved her hand toward the suit case
1666,1578-6379-0012.flac,truly an honest patty turned it over and pointed to the initials on the end
1667,1578-6379-0041.flac,they peered daintily at the other garments oh squealed may mertell he wears blue silk suspenders and something else blue chirped edna hartwell peering over her shoulder theire pajamas and to think of such a thing happening to patty
1668,1578-6379-0009.flac,priscilla and conny turned upstairs lugging the suit case between them while patty approached the principal study ten minutes later she joined her companions in seven paradise ally they were sitting on the bed their chins in their hands
1669,1578-6379-0002.flac,it was planned to accommodate twenty patty and her suit case alone in the capacious interior were jolting about like two tiny peas in a very big pod
1670,1578-6379-0001.flac,with the dexterity of practice sprang upon the rear step of the hearse as it turned in at the school gate and rolled up the curving drive to the port cochere the hearse was the popular name for the black varnished wagonette which conveyed the pupils of saint ursula's from church and station
1671,1578-6379-0042.flac,sighed mamertell why not bristled patty you're so
1672,1578-6379-0010.flac,studying the suit case propped on the chair before them well they inquired in a breath she says she's glad to see me back and hopes i didn't eat too much wedding cake
1673,1578-6379-0031.flac,just like all my dancing dresses nine inches off the floor with elbow sleeves in a silly sash i hated it anyway you must remember you are a school girl conny quoted and until just wait till i tell you patty triumphed
1674,1578-6379-0040.flac,eight others followed her example and thrilled at the touch it was calculated to fit a far larger person than any present even irene mc cullagh found it baggy he had awfully broad shoulders said rosalie stroking the satin lining
1675,1578-6379-0019.flac,she was as flustered as an old hen with one chicken she put me in charge of a conductor with so many instructions that i know he felt like a newly engaged nursemaid the glee club men rode in the smoking car
1676,1578-6379-0028.flac,and various other masculine trifles filling in the interstices oh they gasped in breathless chorus they belong to him conny murmured fervently patty nodded and when i showed uncle tom that suit case he nearly died laughing
1677,1578-6379-0023.flac,all the ushers and bridesmaids were there and everything was very jolly only i couldn't make out what they were talking about half the time because they all knew each other and had a lot of jokes i couldn't understand
1678,1578-6379-0037.flac,and she hoped he was a gentleman and would take it nicely she telephoned to the baggage man that it was here but she couldn't send martin with it this afternoon because he had to go to the farm for some eggs recreation was over and the girls came trooping in to gather books and pads and pencils for the approaching study hour
1679,1578-6379-0045.flac,missus trent would like to have miss patty wyatt come to the drawing room and i am to take the suit case down the gentleman is waiting oh patty a gasp went around the room do your hair up quick priscilla caught patty's twin braids and wound them around her head
1680,1578-6379-0004.flac,postilions descended and martin gathered up his reins come on yuse all who wants a ride to the stables was his hospitable invitation it inundated him with passengers they crowded inside twice as many as the hearse would hold
1681,1578-6379-0024.flac,conny nodded feelingly that's the way they acted at the seaside last summer i think grown people have horrid manners i did feel sort of young patty acknowledged
1682,1578-6379-0011.flac,the man with the black eyebrows and the dimple in his chin who sang the funny songs third from the end on the right hand side german hilliard junior priscilla asked breathlessly not really conny laid her hand on her heart with an exaggerated sigh
1683,1578-6379-0000.flac,the third man from the end oh patty did you bring us some wedding cake did you have any adventures
1684,1578-6379-0047.flac,punctuated by an occasional deep base laugh when they heard the front door close with one accord they invaded harriet gladden's room which commanded the walk and pressed their noses against the pane a short thick set man of german build was waddling toward the gate and the trolley car
1685,1578-6379-0025.flac,he was trying to obey louise an amuse little cousin but he was thinking all the time
1686,1578-6379-0026.flac,i told you to put it up said priscilla just wait said patty portentously when i went upstairs to dress for dinner the maid met me in the hall with her eyes popping out of her head beg pardon miss patty she said but is that your suit case yes i said of course it's my suit case
1687,1578-6379-0044.flac,the end said may unkindly will be that the baggage man will deliver the suit case and german hilliard junior will never know a maid appeared at the door if you please she murmured her amazed eyes on irene who was still wearing the coat
1688,1578-140049-0031.flac,and oh aunt jane aunt miranda if you'll only come into the kitchen and look out of the sink window you can see the banquet lamp shining all red just as if the simpson's house was on fire and probably it will be before long observed miranda i've got no patience with such foolish goings on
1689,1578-140049-0035.flac,he needed the soap dreadfully as a present for his aunt miss jane still looked a little unconvinced though she only said i hope your aunt miranda won't mind but you know how particular she is rebecca and i really wish you wouldn't do anything out of the ordinary without asking her first for your actions are very queer
1690,1578-140049-0014.flac,and changed the subject much to jane's gratitude for she had been nervous and ill at ease for the last fifteen minutes what child in riverboro could be described as remarkable an winning save rebecca what child had wonderful eyes except the same rebecca
1691,1578-140049-0030.flac,it was a heavenly party she cried taking off her hat and cape go back and see if you have shut the door tight and then lock it said miss miranda in her usual austere manner
1692,1578-140049-0002.flac,can't you sit still for once and listen to the improving conversation of your elders
1693,1578-140049-0026.flac,and oh i'm so glad you both live where you can see it shine from our windows i wonder how long it will burn without being filled if i only keep it lit one hour every night
1694,1578-140049-0036.flac,there can't be anything wrong this time rebecca answered confidently emma jane sold her cakes to her own relations and to uncle jerry cobb and i went first to those new tenements near the lumber mill and then to the lads mister ladd bought all we had and made us promise to keep the secret until the premium came
1695,1578-140049-0006.flac,the burnham sisters nodded approvingly as rebecca went out and remarked that they had never seen a child grow and improve so fast in so short a time there's plenty of room left for more improvement as you'd know if she lived in the same house with you answered miranda
1696,1578-140049-0019.flac,we never thought of the expense of keeping up the lamp rebecca no we didn't but let's not worry about that till after the party i have a handful of nuts and raisins and some apples i have peppermints and maples sugar said emma jane they had a real thanksgiving dinner
1697,1578-140049-0028.flac,it was mister aladdin whispered rebecca as they ran down the path to the gate seesaw followed them and handsomely offered to see them a piece down the road but rebecca declined his escort with such decision that he did not press the matter
1698,1578-140049-0010.flac,there's hope for him still though said miss jane smilingly for i don't s'pose he's more than thirty he could get a wife in riverboro if he was a hundred and thirty remarked miss miranda adam's aunt says he was so taken with a little girl that sold the soap clara belle did you say her name was
1699,1578-140049-0012.flac,for this one couldn't have been cross eyed i remember missus ladd saying adam remarked about this child's handsome eyes he said it was her eyes that made him buy the three hundred cakes missus ladd has it stacked up in the shed chamber
1700,1578-140049-0029.flac,but went to bed to dream of her instead in his dreams flashes of lightning proceeded from both her eyes and she held a flaming sword in either hand rebecca entered the home dining room joyously the burnham's sisters had gone and the two aunts were knitting
1701,1578-140049-0020.flac,the doctor gave them sweet potatoes and cranberries and turnips father sent a spare rib and missus cobb a chicken and a jar of mince meat at half past five one might have looked in at the simpson's windows and seen the party at its height
1702,1578-140049-0032.flac,jane accompanied rebecca into the kitchen although the feeble glimmer which she was able to see from that distance did not seem to her a dazzling exhibition she tried to be as enthusiastic as possible rebecca who was it
1703,1578-140049-0003.flac,what under the canopy did they want of a lamp and where did they get the money to pay for it if abner was at home i should think he'd been swapping again said miss miranda the children got it as a prize for seling soap replied rebecca
1704,1578-140049-0024.flac,the lamp it was tacitly felt by everybody was dignifying the party and providing sufficient entertainment simply by its presence being fully as satisfactory in its way as a pianola or a string band i wish father could see it said clara belle loyally
1705,1578-140049-0011.flac,that he declared he was going to bring her a christmas present continued miss ellen well there's no accountin for tastes exclaimed miss miranda clara belle's got cross eyes and red hair but i'd be the last one to grudge her a christmas present
1706,1578-140049-0004.flac,what have you got in the pocket of that new dress that makes it sag down so it's my nuts and raisins from dinner replied rebecca who never succeeded in keeping the most innocent action a secret from her aunt miranda they're just what you gave me on my plate why didn't you eat them
1707,1578-140049-0015.flac,and finally was there ever a child in the world who could make a man buy soap by the hundred cakes save rebecca meantime the remarkable child had flown up the road in the deepening dusk but she had not gone far before she heard the sound of hurrying footsteps
1708,1578-140049-0038.flac,there was the sweetness of the mayflower and the strength of the young oak but one could easily divine that she was one of the souls by nature pitchd too high by suffering plunged too low
1709,1578-140049-0007.flac,one of them must have said miss ellen burnham
1710,1578-140049-0017.flac,our selling the three hundred cakes corrected rebecca you did as much as i no i didn't rebecca ran doll i just sat at the gate and held the horse yes but whose horse was it that took us to north riverboro
1711,1578-140049-0005.flac,they were your own rebecca interposed aunt jane and if you chose to save them to give away it is all right we ought never to let this day pass without giving our neighbors something to be thankful for instead of taking all the time to think of our own mercies
1712,1578-140049-0000.flac,the banquet lamp there had been company at the brick house to the bountiful thanksgiving dinner which had been provided at one o'clock the burnham sisters who lived between north riverboro and shaker village and who for more than a quarter of a century
1713,1578-140049-0025.flac,remarked susan sagaciously at the appointed hour rebecca dragged herself reluctantly away from the enchanting scene
1714,1578-140049-0023.flac,in the wide splash of light that it flung upon the floor sat the simpsons in reverent and solemn silence emma jane standing behind them hand in hand with rebecca there seemed to be no desire for conversation the occasion was too thrilling and serious for that
1715,1578-140049-0001.flac,had come to pass the holiday with the sawyers every year rebecca sat silent with a book after the dinner dishes were washed and when it was nearly five asked if she might go to the simpsons
1716,1578-140049-0013.flac,three hundred cakes ejaculated miranda well there's one crop that never fails in riverboro what's that asked miss lydia politely the fool crop responded miranda tersely
1717,1578-140049-0008.flac,it must have been clara belle and i should never call her remarkable answered miss miranda has adam been home again yes he's been staying a few days with his aunt there's no limit to the money he's making they say and he always brings presents for all the neighbors
1718,1578-140049-0021.flac,missus simpson had let the kitchen fire die out and had brought the baby to grace the festal scene
1719,1578-140049-0009.flac,this time it was a full set of furs for missus ladd and to think we can remember the time he was a barefoot boy without two shirts to his back it is strange he hasn't married with all his money and him so fond of children that he always has a pack of them at his heels
1720,1578-140049-0018.flac,but what's the trouble the simpsons have no kerosene and no wicks i guess they thought a banquet lamp was something that lighted itself and burned without any help seesaw has gone to the doctors to try if he can borrow a wick and mother let me have a pint of oil but she says she won't give me any more
1721,1578-140049-0016.flac,and saw a well known figure coming in her direction in a moment she and emma jane met and exchanged a breathless embrace something awful has happened panted emma jane don't tell me it's broken exclaimed rebecca no o no not that
1722,1578-140049-0027.flac,mister tubbs brought it over from north riverboro and said somebody sent an order by mail for it rebecca squeezed emma jane's arm and emma jane gave a rapturous return squeeze
1723,1578-140049-0034.flac,i asked you who sold the soap to adam ladd resumed miss jane adam ladd then he's a ladd too what fun answer me rebecca oh execuse me aunt jane i was so busy thinking emma jane and i sold the soap to mister ladd
1724,1578-140049-0037.flac,rebecca's hair was loosened and falling over her forehead in ruffled waves her eyes were brilliant her cheeks crimson there was a hint of everything in the girl's face of sensitiveness and delicacy as well as of ardor
1725,1578-140049-0033.flac,that sold the three hundred cakes of soap to mister ladd in north riverboro mister who exclaimed rebecca mister ladd in north riverboro is that his real name queried rebecca in astonishment i didn't make a bad guess and she laughed softly to herself
1726,1578-140049-0022.flac,on it stood the sacred the adored the long desired object almost as beautiful and nearly half as large as the advertisement the brass glistened like gold and the crimson paper shade glowed like a giant ruby
1727,1578-140045-0011.flac,she was obliged to confess that she had written nothing you have at least two lines rebecca insisted the teacher for i see them on your slate
1728,1578-140045-0018.flac,does one ever feel bereft when one picks up one's chips to light one's fire for one's evening meal or when one washes one's milk pail before milking one's cow one would fancy not r r r
1729,1578-140045-0002.flac,must be far more beautiful than milltown which would she felt take its proud place among the cities of the earth by reason of its tremendous business activity rather than by any irresistible appeal to the imagination
1730,1578-140045-0016.flac,it then appeared in the following form which hardly satisfied either teacher or pupil solitude it would be false to say that one could ever be alone when one has one's lovely thoughts to comfort one
1731,1578-140045-0013.flac,and the training of the young idea seldom appealed to the sense of humor you must stay after school and try again rebecca she said but she said it smilingly your poetry hasn't a very nice idea in it for a good little girl who ought to love duty
1732,1578-140045-0015.flac,having been instructed in the use of the indefinite pronoun one as giving a refined and elegant touch to literary efforts rebecca painstakingly rewrote her composition on solitude giving it all the benefit of miss dearborne's suggestion
1733,1578-140045-0020.flac,yes i don't like a cow in a composition said the difficult miss dearborn
1734,1578-140045-0027.flac,it was more like praying well you've got no call to be prayin any more than swearin in the middle of the road said miranda but i'm thankful it's no worse you're born to trouble as the sparks fly upward
1735,1578-140045-0001.flac,in the matter of mere pictorial beauty so soon does the soul outgrow its mansions that after once seeing milltown her fancy ran out to the future sight of portland for that having islands and a harbor and two public monuments
1736,1578-140045-0028.flac,and i'm afraid you always will be till you learned to bridle your unruly tongue i wish sometimes that i could bridle minnie's murmured rebecca as she went to set the table for supper i declare she is the beatenest child said miranda
1737,1578-140045-0024.flac,we couldn't keep from laughing after we came out of the tent because they were acting on such a small platform that eliza had to run round and round
1738,1578-140045-0003.flac,i tell you harriet beecherstow herself couldn't a done it better justice i took it all in responded mister cobb who was pleased that mother agreed with him about rebecca i ain't sure but she's goin to turn out somethin remarkable
1739,1578-140045-0005.flac,or recite pieces like that portland elocutionist that come out here to the harvest supper i guess she'll be able to write down her own pieces said mister cobb confidently she could make em up faster 'n she could read em out of a book
1740,1578-140045-0021.flac,for the next week minnie smellie's mother told miranda sawyer that she'd better look after rebecca for she was given to swearing and profane language that she had been heard saying something dreadful that very afternoon saying it before emma jane and living perkins who only laughed
1741,1578-140045-0007.flac,solitude but with none of them did rebecca seem to grapple satisfactorily wrigt as you talk rebecca insisted poor miss dearborne who secretly knew that she could never manage a good composition herself
1742,1578-140045-0023.flac,emma jane living and i were walking along and i was ahead i saw the water streaming over the road towards the ditch and it reminded me of uncle tom's cabin at milltown when eliza took her baby and ran across the mississippi on the ice blocks pursued by the bloodhounds
1743,1578-140045-0025.flac,and part of the time she had to pursue the dog i knew living would remember too so i took off my waterproof and wrapped it round my books for a baby
1744,1578-140045-0014.flac,it wasn't my idea said rebecca apologetically i had only made the first line when i saw you were going to ring the bell and say the time was up i had clash written and i couldn't think of anything then but hash or rash or smash i'll change it to this
1745,1578-140045-0006.flac,rebecca made a poor hand at composition writing at this time miss dearborne gave her every sort of subject that she had ever been given herself cloud pictures abraham lincoln nature philanthropy slavery intemperance joy and duty
1746,1578-140045-0012.flac,read what you have good or bad little or much i am excusing nobody rebecca rose overcome with secret laughter dread and mortification then in a low voice she read the couplet
1747,1578-140045-0017.flac,one sits by one's self it is true but one thinks one opens one's favorite book and reads one's favorite story one speaks to one's aunt or one's brother fondles one's cat
1748,1578-140045-0000.flac,the stirring of the powers rebecca's visit to milltown was all that her glowing fancy had painted it except that recent readings about rome and venice disposed her to believe that those cities might have an advantage over milltown
1749,1578-140045-0010.flac,of recollection joy and duty had been the inspiring subject given to the older children for a theme to be written in five minutes rebecca had wrestled struggled perspired in vain when her turn came to read
1750,1578-140045-0019.flac,don't you think calling supper one's evening meal is pretty and isn't bereft a nice word yes that part of it does very well it is the cat the chips and the milk pail that i don't like
1751,1578-140045-0008.flac,now in your last one on solitude you haven't said anything very interesting and you've made it too common and every day to sound well there are too many yeus and yours in it you ought to say one now and then to make it seem more like good writing one opens a favorite book
1752,1578-140045-0004.flac,land no mother there ain't no home path bout miss parks she drives all over the country i can't see rebecca as a lady doctor somehow mused missus cubb her gift o gab is what's going to be the makin of her
1753,1578-140045-0029.flac,but whether it's for the better or the worse i can't hardly tell till she grows up she's got the making of most anything in her rebecca has but i feel sometimes as if we were not fitted to cope with her stuff and nonsense said miranda
1754,1578-140045-0026.flac,just like that the same as eliza did in the play then i leaped from puddle to puddle and living an emma jane pursued me like the bloodhounds it's just like that stupid minnie smellie who doesn't know a game when she sees one ant eliza wasn't swearing when she said my god the river
1755,1578-140045-0009.flac,one's thoughts are a great comfort in solitude and so on i don't know any more about solitude this week than i did about joy and duty last week grumbled rebecca you tried to be funny about joy and duty said miss dearborn reprovingly so of course you didn't succeed
1756,1578-140045-0022.flac,don't be ugly and obstinate but think real hard when did they chase you up the road and what were you doing a sudden light broke upon rebecca's darkness
1757,7264-92314-0008.flac,if any one doubts that this adjective official can properly be applied to our capitalist press to day let him ask himself first what the forces are which govern the nation and next whether those forces the government or regime
1758,7264-92314-0000.flac,i say that the few newspaper controllers govern and govern abominably i am right but they only do so as do all new powers by at once alliance with and treason against the old witness harmsworth and the politicians
1759,7264-92314-0021.flac,and especially to the one most wealthy and unscrupulous among them whose wealth is an accident of speculation whose origins are repulsive and whose characters have as a rule the weakness and baseness developed by this sort of adventures
1760,7264-92314-0005.flac,this plutocracy a few wealthy interests in part controls in part is expressed by is in part identical with the professional politicians and it has in the existing capitalist press an ally similar to that official press
1761,7264-92314-0019.flac,they have not advanced nearly as far as the discovery of the great newspaper owners and their system they are still for the most part duped
1762,7264-92314-0013.flac,it suppressed for months all reference to that astounding instance of the misdemeanor by the connections of a very prominent professional politician early in the war and refused to comment on the single reference made to this crime in the house of commons
1763,7264-92314-0001.flac,this connection has developed in the great capitalist papers a certain character which can be best described by the term official under certain forms of arbitrary government in continental europe ministers once made use of picked
1764,7264-92314-0022.flac,there are among such gutter snipes thousands whose luck ends in the native gutter half a dozen whose luck lands them into millions one or two at most who on the top of such a career go crazy with the ambition of the parvenue and propose to direct the state
1765,7264-92314-0028.flac,i am not acquainted with any other modern language than french and english but i read this free press french and english colonial and american regularly and it seems to me the chief intellectual phenomenon of our time
1766,7264-92314-0030.flac,the new age was i think the pioneer in the matter
1767,7264-92314-0017.flac,the result is that the mass of englishmen have ceased to obtain or even to expect information upon the way they are governed they are beginning to feel a certain uneasiness they know that their old power of observation over public servants has slipped from them
1768,7264-92314-0027.flac,were it not that such a word would connote as yet a little too much power though i do believe its power to be rising and though i am confident that it will in the near future change our affairs
1769,7264-92314-0018.flac,they suspect that the known gross corruption of public life and particularly of the house of commons is entrenched behind a conspiracy of silence on the part of those very few who have the power to inform them but as yet they have not passed the stage of such suspicion
1770,7264-92314-0006.flac,which continental nations knew in the past but there is this great difference that the official press of continental experiments never consisted in more than a few chosen organs
1771,7264-92314-0025.flac,now to every human evil of a political sort that has appeared in history to every evil that is affecting the state and proceeding from the will of man not from ungovernable natural forces outside man there comes a term and a reaction
1772,7264-92314-0029.flac,in france and in england and for all i know elsewhere there has arisen in protest against the complete corruption and falsehood of the great capitalist papers a crop of new organs which are in the strictest sense of the word organs of opinion
1773,7264-92314-0031.flac,scotland one or two their number will increase with this i pass from the just denunciation of evil to the exposition of what is good
1774,7264-92314-0009.flac,could be better served even under a system of permanent censorship than it is in the great dailies of london and the principal provincial capitals is not everything which the regime desires to be suppressed suppressed is not everything which it desires suggested suggested
1775,7264-92314-0003.flac,least of all in england what has grown up here is a press organization of support and favor to the system of professional politics which colors the whole of our great capitalist papers to day in england this gives them so distinct a character of parliamentary falsehood
1776,7264-92314-0012.flac,one paper not a little while ago was clamoring against the excess of lawyers in government its remedy was an opposition to be headed by a lawyer another was very serious upon secret trading with the enemy
1777,7264-92314-0014.flac,another clamours for the elimination of enemy financial power in the affairs of this country and yet says not a word upon the auditing of the secret party funds
1778,7264-92314-0016.flac,they are not independent where power is concerned they do not really criticize they serve a cliqque whom they should expose and denounce and betray the generality that is the state for whose sake the salaried public servants should be perpetually watched with suspicion and sharply kept in control
1779,7264-92314-0007.flac,the character of which was well known and the attitude of which contrasted sharply with the rest but our official press for it is no less covers the whole field it has in the region of the great newspapers no competitor indeed it has no competitors at all
1780,7264-92314-0002.flac,and rare newspapers to express their views and these newspapers came to be called the official press it was a crude method and has been long abandoned even by the simpler despotic forms of government nothing of that kind exist now of course in the deeper corruption of modern europe
1781,7264-92314-0010.flac,and is there any public question which would weaken the regime and the discussion of which is ever allowed to appear in the great capitalist journals there has not been such a case for at least twenty years
1782,7264-92314-0004.flac,and that falsehood is so clearly dictated by their connection with executive power that they merit the title official the regime under which we are now living is that of a plutocracy which has gradually replaced the old aristocratic tradition of england
1783,7264-92314-0024.flac,no shred of responsibility to any organ of the state they are a deadly peril the chief of these men are more powerful to day than any minister nay they do as i have said and it is now notorious make and unmake ministers and they may yet in our worst hour decide the national fate
1784,7264-92314-0011.flac,never deals with matters vital to its prestige on the contrary it deliberately side tracks any vital discussion that sincere conviction may have forced upon the public and spoils the scent with false issues
1785,7264-92314-0023.flac,even when gambling adventures of this sort are known and responsible as they are in professional politics their power is a grave danger possessing as the newspaper owners do every power of concealment and at the same time
1786,7264-92314-0026.flac,side by side with what i have called the official press an our top heavy plutocracy there has arisen a certain force for which i have difficulty in finding a name but which i will call for lack of a better name the free press i might call it the independent press
1787,7264-92314-0020.flac,is a very great evil it warps and depletes public information it prevents the just criticism of public servants above all it gives immense and irresponsible power to a handful of wealthy men
1788,7264-92314-0015.flac,i say that the big daily papers have now not only those other qualities dangerous to the state which i have described but that they have become essentially official that is insincere and corrupt in their interested support of that plutocratic complex which in the decay of aristocracy governs england
1789,7264-92310-0021.flac,often quite conscious and direct of advertising power over the press and this was as i have said not only negative that was long obvious but at last positive
1790,7264-92310-0023.flac,so far we see the growth of the press marked by these characteristics one it falls into the hands of a very few rich men and nearly always of men of base origin and capacities two it is in their hands a mere commercial enterprise
1791,7264-92310-0027.flac,the difference being paid by the advertisement subsidy
1792,7264-92310-0022.flac,both combatants are of a low cunning and unintelligent type minor friction due to the same cause is constantly taking place sometimes the victory falls to the newspaper proprietor more often to the advertiser never to the public
1793,7264-92310-0004.flac,an individual newspaper owner might for instance have the greatest possible dislike for the trade in patent medicines he might object to the swindling of the poor which is the soul of that trade he might himself have suffered acute physical pain
1794,7264-92310-0025.flac,but the fact that advertisement makes a paper has created a standard of printing and paper such that no one save at a disastrous loss can issue regularly to large numbers news and opinion which the large capitalist advertisers disapprove
1795,7264-92310-0020.flac,all of which need the suggestion of advertisement the newspaper owner and the advertiser then were intermixed but on the balance the advertising interest being wider spread was the stronger and what you got was a sort of imposition
1796,7264-92310-0014.flac,or some such place that the paper was in bad taste not only was there this negative power in the hands of the advertiser that of refusing the favor or patronage of his advertisements there was also a positive one though that only grew up later
1797,7264-92310-0007.flac,the proprietor was always at the choice of publishing matter which did not affect him and saving his fortune or refusing it and jeopardizing his fortune he chose the former course in the second place there was an even more serious development advertisement
1798,7264-92310-0008.flac,having become the stand by of the newspaper the large advertiser
1799,7264-92310-0000.flac,let us halt at this phase in the development of the thing to consider certain other changes which were on the point of appearance and why they were on the point of appearance in the first place if advertisement had come to be the stand by of a newspaper
1800,7264-92310-0006.flac,and fear friction in their own case he would prefer to retain his income persuade his readers to buy poison and remain free personally from touching the stuff he recommended for pay
1801,7264-92310-0001.flac,the capitalist owning the sheet would necessarily consider his revenue from advertisement before anything else he was indeed compelled to do so unless he had enormous revenues from other sources and ran his paper as a luxury costing a vast fortune a year
1802,7264-92310-0031.flac,no policy is attempted until it is ascertained that the newspaper owner is in favor of it few are proffered without first consulting his wishes many are directly ordered by him we are if we talk in terms of real things as men do in their private councils at westminster
1803,7264-92310-0013.flac,he was muddle headed about the distinction between a large circulation and a circulation small but appealing to the rich he would refuse advertisements of luxuries to a paper read by half the wealthier class if he had heard in the national liberal club
1804,7264-92310-0002.flac,for in this industry the rule is either very great profits or very great and rapid losses
1805,7264-92310-0030.flac,it was undreamt of but a few years ago it is already to day the capital fact of our whole political system a prime minister is made or deposed by the owner of a group of newspapers not by popular vote or by any other form of open authority
1806,7264-92310-0028.flac,it is the advent of the great newspaper owner as the true governing power in the political machinery of the state superior to the officials in the state nominating ministers and dismissing them imposing policies and in general usurping sovereignty
1807,7264-92310-0026.flac,there would seem to be for any independent press no possible economic basis because the public has been taught to expect for
1808,7264-92310-0011.flac,besides those of mere advarice effect exchange there are a million half conscious and subconscious motives at work as well the large advertisers still mainly paid for advertisement according to circulation
1809,7264-92310-0009.flac,could not but regard his giving of an advertisement as something of a favor there is always this psychological or if you will artistic element in exchange in pure economics exchanges exactly balanced by the respective advantages of the exchangers
1810,7264-92310-0017.flac,the same man who owned the daily times was a shareholder in jones soap or smith's pills the man who gambled and lost on the howl was at the same time gambling and winning on a bucket shop advertised in the howl
1811,7264-92310-0015.flac,the advertiser came to see that he could actually dictate policy and opinion and that he had also another most powerful and novel weapon in his hand which was the suppression of news
1812,7264-92310-0012.flac,he would not advertise in papers which he thought might by their publication of opinion ultimately hurt capitalism as a whole still less in those whose opinions might affect his own private fortune adversely stupid like all people given up to gain
1813,7264-92310-0024.flac,three it is economically supported by advertisers who can in part control it but these are of the same capitalist kind in motive and manner with the owners of the papers their power does not therefore clash in the mane with that of the owners
1814,7264-92310-0032.flac,mainly governed to day not even by the professional politicians nor even by those who pay them money but by whatever owner of a newspaper trust is for the moment the most unscrupulous and the most ambitious
1815,7264-92310-0029.flac,all this secretly and without responsibility it is the chief political event of our time and is the peculiar mark of this country to day its full development has come on us suddenly and taken us by surprise in the midst of a terrible war
1816,7264-92310-0016.flac,we must not exaggerate this element for one thing the power represented by the great capitalist press was a power equal with that of the great advertisers for another there was no clear cut distinction between the capitalism that ownd newspapers and the capitalism that advertised
1817,7264-92310-0003.flac,where a great daily paper is concerned he was compelled then to respect his advertisers as his pay masters to that extent therefore his power of giving true news and of printing sound opinion was limited even though his own inclinations should lean towards such news and such opinion
1818,7264-92310-0018.flac,there was no antagonism of class interest one against the other and what was more they were of the same kind and breed
1819,7264-92310-0019.flac,was exactly the same kind of man as he who bought a peerage out of a combine in music halls or cut his throat when his bluff in indian silver was called the type is the common modern type parliament is full of it and it runs newspapers only as one of its activities
1820,7264-92310-0010.flac,just as in pure dynamics you have the parallelogram of forces in the immense complexity of the real world material friction and a million other things affect the ideal parallelogram of forces and in economics other conscious passions
1821,7264-92310-0005.flac,but he certainly could not print an article against him nor even an article describing how they were made without losing a great part of his income directly and perhaps indirectly the whole of it from the annoyance cause to other advertisers who would note his independence
1822,7264-92316-0045.flac,but that small number knew very well that we were thus in reality governed by men responsible to no one and hidden from public blame
1823,7264-92316-0021.flac,the great dailies were thought grey not wicked only general and vague the free press in its beginnings did not attack as an enemy it only timidly claimed to be heard it regarded itself as a speciality it was humble and there went with it a mass of eccentric stuff
1824,7264-92316-0015.flac,had captured the whole field the first propagandis then did not stand up to the official press as equals they crept in as inferiors or rather as open eccentrics
1825,7264-92316-0026.flac,but i know that wherever i get hold of such an organ it will be very strongly colored with the opinion or even fanaticism of some minority the free press as a whole
1826,7264-92316-0027.flac,if you add it all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement against another does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live the official press to day gives you an absurdly false one everywhere
1827,7264-92316-0042.flac,unfortunately it could affect only very few men with the mass even of well educated and observant men the feeling created by the novel power of the great papers was little more than a vague ill ease
1828,7264-92316-0044.flac,dispose of cabinets nominate absurd ministers but the particular vivid concrete instances that specially move men to action were hidden from them only a small number of people were acquainted with such particular truts
1829,7264-92316-0007.flac,a generation ago and more great numbers of men were persuaded that a solution for the whole complex of social injustice was to be found in what they called nationalizing the means of production distribution and exchange
1830,7264-92316-0039.flac,but only a little later than this second motive of indignation against falsehood and acting with equal force though upon fewer men was the third motive of freedom of indignation against arbitrary power
1831,7264-92316-0002.flac,and there was an end of it great bodies of men who cared intensely for a definite creed found that expression for it was lacking
1832,7264-92316-0013.flac,these founders of the free press seem to say we may convert the mass to our views but for the moment we are admittedly a cliqu an exceptional body with the penalties attaching to such
1833,7264-92316-0018.flac,but i now know that these small socialist free papers were talking the plainest common sense when they specifically emphasized as capitalist the falsehoods and suppressions of their great contemporaries
1834,7264-92316-0043.flac,they had a general conception that the owner of a widely circulated popular newspaper could and did blackmail the professional politician make or unmake the professional politician by granting or refusing him the limelight
1835,7264-92316-0009.flac,this creed was held with passionate conviction by men of the highest ability in every country of europe and a socialist press began to arise which was everywhere free and soon in active opposition to the official press
1836,7264-92316-0035.flac,men owning the chief newspapers could be heard boasting of their power in public as an admitted thing and as this power was recognized and as it grew with time and experiment it bread a reaction
1837,7264-92316-0029.flac,because it came later than the official press of capitalism and was in its origins but a reaction against it b the second motive that of indignation against falsehood came to work much later than the motive of propaganda
1838,7264-92316-0040.flac,but it is intolerable that similar powers should reside in the hands of obscure nobodies about whom no illusion could possibly exist whose tyranny is not admitted or public at all who do not even take the risk of exposing their features and to whom no responsibility whatever attaches
1839,7264-92316-0017.flac,to papers like the daily telegraph or the times with the epitaph capitalist put after them in brackets i thought then it was the giving of an abnormal epithet to a normal thing
1840,7264-92316-0034.flac,but not a cabinet minister that could not pass an examination in the life vices vulnerability fortune investments and favors of the owner the change was rapidly admitted it came quickly but thoroughly at last like most rapid developments it exceeded itself
1841,7264-92316-0037.flac,to lie the sheer necessity of getting certain truths told which these powerful but hidden fellows refused to tell was a force working at high potential and almost compelling the production of free papers side by side with the big official ones
1842,7264-92316-0010.flac,again of a religious temper in their segregation conviction and enthusiasm there began to appear when the oppressor was mild the small papers defending the rights of oppressed nationalities
1843,7264-92316-0000.flac,the motive of propaganda which began to work much the earliest of the three concerned religions and also certain racial enthusiasms or political doctrines which by their sincerity and readiness for sacrifice had half the force of religions
1844,7264-92316-0008.flac,that is of course in plain english putting land houses and machinery and stores of food and clothing into the hands of the politicians for control in use and for distribution in consumption
1845,7264-92316-0022.flac,if one passes in review all the free press journals which owned their existence in england and france alone to this motive of propaganda one finds many side shows as it were beside the main motives of local or race patriotism religion or socialist conviction
1846,7264-92316-0014.flac,they said this although the whole life of france is at least as catholic as the life of great britain is plutocratic or the life of switzerland democratic and they said it because they arose after the capitalist press neutral in religion as in every vital thing
1847,7264-92316-0032.flac,but it was a sort of dual arrangement which yet modified the power of the vulgar owner i myself remember the state of affairs the editor who was a gentleman and dined out the proprietor who was a lord and nervous when he met a gentleman
1848,7264-92316-0012.flac,felt no particular animosity against the debets for instance his particular catholic enthusiasm recognized itself as exceptional and was content to accept the humble or at any rate inferior position which admitted eccentricity connotes later
1849,7264-92316-0020.flac,though however certain of the socialist free papers thus boldly took up a standpoint of moral equality with the others their attitude was exceptional
1850,7264-92316-0024.flac,we may take it then that propaganda was in order of time the first motive of the free press and the first cause of its production now from this fact arises a consideration of great importance to our subject
1851,7264-92316-0011.flac,religion then and cognate enthusiasms were the first breeders of the free press it is exceedingly important to recognize this because it has stamped the whole movement with a particular character to which i shall later refer when it come to its disabilities
1852,7264-92316-0019.flac,from the socialist point of view the leading fact about the insincerity of the great official papers is that this insincerity is capitalist just as from a catholic point of view the leading fact about it was and is that it is anti catholic
1853,7264-92316-0004.flac,there was nothing to distinguish a large daily paper owned by a jew from one owned by an ignostic or a catholic necessity of expression compelled the creation of a free press in connection with this one motive of religion men came across very little of this in england
1854,7264-92316-0023.flac,you have the single tax papers you have the tea total papers and really it is a wonder that you have not yet also had the iconoclasts and the diabolists producing papers the rationalist and the atheist propaganda i reckon among the religious
1855,7264-92316-0003.flac,the organs of opinion professed a genteel ignorance of that idea which was most widespread most intense and most formative
1856,7264-92316-0031.flac,there was more than this for long the owner of a newspaper had for the most part been content to regard it as a revenue producing thing the editor was supreme in matters of culture and opinion true the editor being revocable and poor could not pretend to full political power
1857,7264-92316-0028.flac,no one of them is in any sense general or really national the free press gives you the truth but only in disjointed sections for it is disperate and it is particularist it is marked with isolation and it is so marked because its origin lay in various and most diverse propaganda
1858,7264-92316-0005.flac,because england was for long virtually homogeneous in religion and that religion was not enthusiastic during the years in which the free press arose but such a free press and defence of religion the pioneer of all the free press arose in ireland and in france and elsewhere
1859,7264-92316-0001.flac,men found that the great papers in their final phase refused to talk about anything really important in religion they dared do nothing but repeat very discreetly the vaguest ethical platitudes they hardly dared do even that they took for granted a certain invertebrate common opinion
1860,7264-92316-0030.flac,men gradually came to notice that one thing after another of great public interest sometimes a vital public interest was deliberately suppressed in the principal great official papers and that positive falsehoods were increasingly suggested or stated
1861,7264-92316-0025.flac,i mean that the free press has had stamped upon it the character of dispirate particularism
1862,7264-92316-0033.flac,the editor became and now is a mere mouthpiece of the proprietor editors seceede each other rapidly of great papers to day the editor's name of the moment is hardly known
1863,7264-92316-0016.flac,for victorian england and third empire france falsely proclaimed the representative quality of the official press to the honor of the socialist movement the socialist free press was the first to stand up as an equal against the giants
1864,7264-92316-0036.flac,why should this or that vulgarian men began to say exercise and boast of the power to keep the people ignorant upon matters vital to us all to distort
1865,7264-92316-0038.flac,that is why you nearly always find the free press directed by men of intelligence and cultivation of exceptional intelligence and cultivation and that is where it contrasts most with its opponents c
1866,7264-92316-0006.flac,but it asserted the necessity of specially emphasizing its particular point of view in its own columns for religion affects all life
1867,7264-92316-0041.flac,the knowledge that this was so provided the third and perhaps the most powerful motive for the creation of a free press
1868,4397-15668-0016.flac,as if attracted by the ringing of their bells they were growing in a small nest like opening between the rock and the bushes and both the erythronium and the fridillaria were in full flower these were the first of the species i had seen
1869,4397-15668-0038.flac,has been transplanted to this wilderness where she blooms alone the lily of san pitch pitch is an old indian who i suppose pitched into the settlers and thus acquired fame enough to give name to the valley
1870,4397-15668-0032.flac,are two species of zagadanas fritillaria atropurpuria
1871,4397-15668-0039.flac,here i feel uneasy about the name of this lily for the compositors have a perverse trick of making me say all kinds of absurd things wholly unwarranted by plain copy and i fear that the lily of san pitch will appear in print as the widow of sa patch
1872,4397-15668-0019.flac,the fly catcher the walking firm et cetera i hardly know how the little bells i have been describing would be regarded by seekers of this class but every true flower lover who comes to consider these utalh lilies will surely be well rewarded however long the way
1873,4397-15668-0024.flac,nature takes the feet and teeth of her flocks into account and makes use of them to trim and cultivate and keep them in order as the bark and buds of the tree are tended by woodpeckers and linnets the ever green woods consist as far as i observed of two species
1874,4397-15668-0028.flac,lying thirty five miles to the south was in full sight also and the river jordan which links the two together may be traced in silvery gleams throughout its whole course
1875,4397-15668-0034.flac,for to it hundreds of them owe their lives during the famine years between eighteen fifty three and eighteen fifty eight great destitution prevailed especially in the southern settlements on account of drouht and grasshoppers
1876,4397-15668-0017.flac,and i need not try to tell the joy they made they were both lowly plants lowly as violets the tallest seldom exceeding six inches in height so that the most searching winds that sweep the mountains scarce reach low enough to shake their bells
1877,4397-15668-0021.flac,i found hundreds of them in full bloom within two feet of the snow in winter only the bulbs are alive sleeping deep beneath the ground like field mice in their nests then the snow flowers fall above them lilies over lilies
1878,4397-15668-0015.flac,on the upper side where the bushes were more open but a company composed of the two lilies i have mentioned were blooming on the lower side and though they were as yet out of sight i suddenly changed my mind and went down to meet them
1879,4397-15668-0036.flac,often curiously freckled like the petals of fritillaria atropurpurea they are fruit rather than flower good brown bread but down in the san pitch valley at gunnison i discovered a genuine lily happily named lily young
1880,4397-15668-0018.flac,the petals being strongly recurved like those of lilium superbum occasionally a specimen is met which has from two to five flowers hung in a loose pinnacle people oftentimes travel far to see curious plants like the carnivorous starlingtonia
1881,4397-15668-0004.flac,when the ice of the glacial period was laid like a mantle over every mountain and valley throughout all these immensely protracted periods in the throng of these majestic operations nature kept her flower children in mind she considered the lilies
1882,4397-15668-0010.flac,after carefully scanning the jagged towers and battlements with which it is roughened i determined to make it my way though it presented but a feeble advertisement of its floral wealth this apparent barrenness however made no great objection just then
1883,4397-15668-0029.flac,the grandest i had carried in many a day i reached the hotel on the lake about dusk with all my fresh riches and my first mountain ramble in utah was accomplished on my way back to the city the next day
1884,4397-15668-0009.flac,i will bathe in the high sky among cool wind waves from the snow from the more southerly of the two peaks a long ridge comes down bent like a bow one end in the hot plains the other in the snow of the summit
1885,4397-15668-0026.flac,snowy ice sculptured ranges bounded the horizon all around while the great lake eighty miles long and fifty miles wide lay fully revealed beneath a lily sky
1886,4397-15668-0030.flac,i shook my big handful of lilies in his face and shouted here are the true saints ancient and latter day enduring forever
1887,4397-15668-0022.flac,until the spring winds blow and these winter lilies wither in turn then the hiding erythronium and fridilarias rise again responsive to the first touches of the sun i notice the tracks of deer in many places among the lily gardens
1888,4397-15668-0025.flac,a spruce and a fir standing close together erect and arrowy in a thrifty compact growth but they are quite small save from six to twelve or fourteen inches in diameter and about forty feet in height among their giant relatives of the sierra
1889,4397-15668-0027.flac,and the wide prairie of water glowing in the gold and purple of evening presented all the colors that tint the lips of shells and the petals of lilies the most beautiful lake this side of the rocky mountains utah lake
1890,4397-15668-0007.flac,and a few weedy looking patches of spruce and fir the simplicity of their slopes preventing their real loftiness from being appreciated gray sagy plains circle around their bases and up to a height of a thousand feet or more their sides are tinged with purple
1891,4397-15668-0037.flac,she is a granddaughter of brigham young slender and graceful with lily white cheeks tinted with clear rose she was brought up in the old salt lake zyon house but by some strange chance
1892,4397-15668-0002.flac,nevertheless in the building and planting of this grand territory the lilies were not forgotten far back in the dim geologic ages when the sediments of the old seas were being gathered and outspread in smooth sheets like leaves of a book
1893,4397-15668-0001.flac,but you may not see a single true lily and only a very few liliaceous plants of any kind not even in the cool fresh glens of the mountains will you find these favorite flowers though some of these desert ranges almost rival the sierra in height
1894,4397-15668-0005.flac,and while planting the plains with sage and the hills with cedar she has covered at least one mountain with golden erytheroniums and fritillarias as its crowning glory as if willing to show what she could do in the lily line even here
1895,4397-15668-0013.flac,two liliaceous plants in particular erythronium grandiflorum and fritillaria pudica are marvellously beautiful and abundant
1896,4397-15668-0008.flac,and over all the smooth crown of snow while standing at their feet the other day shortly after my memorable excursion among the salt waves of the lake i said now i shall have another baptism
1897,4397-15668-0011.flac,i was animated by a mountaineer's eagerness to get my feet into the snow once more and my head into the clear sky after lying dormant all winter at the level of the sea but in every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks
1898,4397-15668-0003.flac,and when these sediments became dry land and were baked and crumbled into the sky as mountain ranges when the lava floods of the fire period were being lavishly poured forth from innumerable rifts and craters
1899,4397-15668-0031.flac,he said they are nice
1900,4397-15668-0020.flac,pushing on up the rugged slopes i found many delightful seclusions moist nooks at the foot of cliffs and lilies in every one of them not growing close together like daisies but well apart with plenty of room for their bells to swing free and ring
1901,4397-15668-0012.flac,i had not gone more than a mile from lake point ere i found the way profusely decked with flowers mostly compositai and purple luguminosae a hundred corolas or more to the square yard with a corresponding abundance of winged blossoms above them moths and butterflies
1902,4397-15668-0006.flac,looking southward from the south end of salt lake the two northernmost peaks of the oquir range are seen swelling calmly into the cool sky without any marked character excepting only their snow crowns
1903,4397-15668-0033.flac,and three or four handsome alliums one of these lilies the calicortus several species of which are well known in california as the mariposa tulips has received great consideration at the hands of the mormons
1904,4397-15668-0000.flac,you may walk the deserts of the great basin in the bloom time of the year all the way across from the snowy sierra to the snowy walsatch and your eyes will be filled with many a gay malva and poppy and abronia and cactus
1905,4397-15668-0023.flac,and at the height of about seven thousand feet i came upon the fresh trail of a flock of wild sheep showing that these fine mountaineers still flourish here above the range of mormon rifles in the planting of her wild gardens
1906,4397-15668-0014.flac,never before in all my walks have i met so glorious a throng of these fine showy liliaceous plants the whole mountain side was aglow with them from a height of fifty five hundred feet to the very edge of the snow
1907,4397-15668-0035.flac,and throughout one hungr winter in particular thousands of the people subsisted chiefly on the bulbs of the tulips called sego by the indians who taught them its use liliaceous women and girls are rare among the mormons
1908,4397-15678-0006.flac,and even full blown transcendentalists though you may go far to find them indians are seldom to be met with away from the sound excepting about the few outlying hop ranches to which they resort to great numbers during the picking season
1909,4397-15678-0018.flac,ox drivers and loggers in stiff gummy overalls back slanting dudes well tailored and shiny and fashions and bonnets of every feather and color bloomd gaily in the noisy throng and advertise london in paris
1910,4397-15678-0015.flac,putting on airs as some would say like boys in haste to be men they are already towns with all modern improvements first class in every particular as is said of hotels they have electric motors and lights
1911,4397-15678-0013.flac,seattle is also charmingly located about twenty miles down the sound from tacoma on eliot bay it is the terminus of the seattle lake shore and eastern railroad now in process of construction and calls itself the queen city of the sound

1990,298-126791-0055.flac,frances withdrew to seek her aunt musing deeply on the character an extreme sensibility of the new acquaintance chance had brought to the cottage the wounded officer followed her with his eyes as she moved with infantile grace through the door of his apartment and as she vanished from his view he observed

1993,298-126791-0001.flac,and doctor sitgreaves removed all further apprehensions by confidently pronouncing that he would be a well man within a fortnight

1995,298-126791-0022.flac,and possibly dreaming that these little feminine offices were performed for another her natural bloom was heightened by the insinuation of the surgeon nor was the lustre of her eye in any degree diminished the sound of the approaching footsteps of sitgreaves hastened her retreat down a private stairway to the side of her sister
1996,298-126791-0051.flac,that is a question the major can answer best but you know the redcoats are abroad and dunwoodie commands in the county these english must be looked to true said singleton slowly as if struck with the other's reasons but how is it that you are idle when there is work to do

1998,298-126791-0041.flac,her beautiful eyes sparkled with renovated brilliancy and her face was lighted with smiles so fascinating that frances who in compliance with her earnest entreaties had accompanied her to the sick chamber sat gazing on a countenance that possessed so wonderful variability
1999,298-126791-0038.flac,and having gained the room where the latter conducted her wept in silence on the shoulder of the observant and soothing girl until frances thought her tears exceeded the emotion natural to the occasion
2000,298-126791-0007.flac,softly my good friend softly said the youth falling back on his pillow and losing some of that collor which alarmed his companion i believe in extracting the ball you did for me all that is required i am free from pain and only weak i do assure you captain singleton said the surgeon with heat
2001,298-126791-0033.flac,still frances could with difficulty withdraw her truant eyes from the countenance of their visitor she was young and of a light and fragile form but of exquisite proportions her eyes were large full black piercing and at times a little wild her hair was luxuriant

2003,298-126791-0045.flac,but isabella the meeting has been too much for you you tremble isabella made no reply she stretched her hand toward the table which held the nourishment of the captain and the attentive frances comprehended her wishes in a moment a glass of water in some measure revived the sister who was enabled to say

2005,298-126791-0002.flac,he breakfasted in his own room and notwithstanding certain significant smiles of the man of science
2006,298-126791-0048.flac,his look was changed to the face of frances who startled by the earnestness of his expression arose and hastily inquired if he would have any assistance if you can pardon the rudeness said the wounded officer making a feeble effort to raise his body i would request to have captain lawton's company for a moment
2007,298-126791-0058.flac,the entrance of doctor sitgreaves who in some alarm noticed the increase of feverish symptoms in his patient enforced this mandate and the trooper withdrew to pay a visit of condolence to roanok who had been an equal sufferer with himself in their last night's somersault
2008,298-126791-0050.flac,the eye of the sister was now bent on the face of the trooper who made his salutations to the lady with ease blended with the frankness of a soldier his man has been here twice he said to inquire how we fared in the lazaretto and why not himself
2009,298-126791-0003.flac,and the latter advanced promptly and laid his fingers on the pulse of the youth beckoning to him to be silent while he muttered growing symptoms of a febrile pulse no no my dear george you must remain quiet and dumb though your eyes look better and your skin has even a moisture
2010,298-126791-0016.flac,from all the members of the family when he made his morning entrance but an invisible spirit presided over the comforts of the english colonel sarah had shrunk with consciousness from entering the room yet she knew the position of every glass and had with her own hands supplied the contents of every bowl that stood on his table
2011,298-126791-0028.flac,a brother wounded and a prisoner and perhaps a victim your father distressed his privacy interrupted and not improbably his estates torn from him on account of his loyalty to his king frances continued her walk in silence while facing the northern entrance to the vaile
2012,298-126791-0021.flac,her own room however afforded her but little relief and in passing through the long gallery that communicated with each of the chambers of the building she noticed the door of singleton's room to be open the wounded youth seemed sleeping and was alone
2013,298-126791-0064.flac,had we succeeded in getting a few good fires upon them in flank we should have sent these brave virginians to the right about ay in that in double quick time cried the colonel making the other leg follow its companion then it was necessary to rout the guides you know and the movement gave them the best possible opportunity to charge
2014,298-126791-0017.flac,at the time of our tale we were a divided people and sarah thought it was no more than her duty to cherish the institutions of that country to which she yet clung as the land of her forefathers but there were other and more cogent reasons for the silent preference she was giving to the englishman
2015,298-126791-0039.flac,the sobs of miss singleton for a time were violent and uncontrollable until with an evident exertion she yielded to a kind observation of her companion and succeeded in suppressing her tears raising her face to the eyes of frances she rose
2016,298-126791-0019.flac,conscious interest kept her tongue tied until her sister with the frankness of innocence had put the desired question to doctor sitgreaves colonel welmere said the operator gravely is in what i call a state of free will madame he is ill or he is well as he pleases
2017,298-126791-0066.flac,they were repulsed you saw in their attempt to drive us from the wood at least they would have been had they made an attack said the captain throwing the rest of his clothes within reach of the colonel

2019,298-126791-0011.flac,everything is as you left it but it glided about the room with the grace of a fairy and the tenderness of an angel
2020,298-126791-0008.flac,it is presumptuous in you to pretend to tell your medical attendant when you are free from pain if it be not to enable us to decide in such matters of what avail the lights of science for shame george for shame even that perverse fellow john lawton could not behave with more obstinacy
2021,298-126791-0053.flac,speak i beg without dread of my displeasure said frances returning the good humored smile of the trooper with the archness natural to her own sweet face the odors of your kitchen then cried lawton bluntly forbid my quitting the domains until i qualify myself to speak with more certainty concerning the fatness of the land
2022,298-126791-0060.flac,orders were accordingly given to be in readiness to rejoin the troop at the four corners as soon as his master had shared in the bounty of the approaching banquet
2023,298-126791-0047.flac,on the march isabella eagerly inquired her brother no dismounted and seemingly at rest was the reply the wondering dragoon turned his gaze on the countenance of his sister who sat with her eye bent on the carpet in unconscious absence but found no explanation
2024,298-126791-0054.flac,oh aunt jeanette is exerting herself to do credit to my father's hospitality said the laughing girl and i am a truant from her labors as i shall be a stranger to her favor unless i proffer my assistance
2025,298-126791-0065.flac,yes said the other sending the second slipper after the first and this major dunwoodie never overlooks an advantage i think if we had the thing to do over again continued the colonel raising himself on his feet we might alter the case very materially though the chief thing the rebels have now to boast of is my capture

2027,298-126791-0061.flac,and by his sympathy succeeded in restoring the colonel to his own good graces
2028,298-126791-0049.flac,frances hastened instantly to communicate his wish to that gentleman and impelled by an interest she could not control she returned again to her seat by the side of miss singleton lawton said the youth impatiently as the trooper entered hear you from the major
2029,298-126791-0040.flac,more composed than her previous agitation had given reason to expect isabella found her brother looking better and in less danger than her sensitive imagination had led her to suppose her spirits rose in proportion from despondency she passed to something like gaiety
2030,298-126791-0004.flac,nay my dear sitgreaves said the youth taking his hand you see there is no fever about me look is there any of jack lawton's hoar frost on my tongue no indeed said the surgeon clapping a spoon in the mouth of the other forcing it open and looking down his throat as if disposed to visit the interior in person
2031,298-126791-0042.flac,impelled by a charm that was beyond her control the youth had thrown an earnest look at frances as soon as his sister raised herself from his arms and perhaps it was the first glance at the lovely lineaments of our heroine
2032,298-126791-0043.flac,when the gazer turned his eyes from the view in disappointment he seemed bewildered rubbed his forehead like a man awaking from a dream and mused where is dunwoodie isabella he said the excellent fellow is never weary of kind actions after a day of such service as that of yesterday
2033,298-126791-0014.flac,the angel i saw may be a daughter a sister or a niece but never an hon hush george hush your talking has brought your pulse up again you must observe quiet and prepare for a meeting with your own sister who will be here within an hour what isabella and who sent for her
2034,298-126791-0067.flac,true true cried the colonel with animation had i been there to have improved that advantage we might have turned the table on the yankees saying which he displayed still greater animation in completing his toilet and he was soon prepared to make his appearance fully restored to his own good opinion and fairly persuaded that his capture was owing to casualties absolutely beyond the control of man
2035,298-126791-0023.flac,the sisters then sought the fresh air on the piazza and as they pursued their walk arm in arm the following dialogue took place there is something disagreeable about this surgeon of dunwoodie said sarah that causes me to wish him away most heartily
2036,298-126791-0018.flac,it is true he wanted the personal excellence of peyton dunwoodie but his pretensions were far from contemptible sarah had moved about the house during the morning casting frequent and longing glances at the door of welmeare's apartment anxious to learn the condition of his wounds and yet ashamed to inquire
2037,298-126791-0030.flac,at length a single horse chaise was seen making its way carefully among the stones which lay scattered over the country road that wound through the valley and approached the cottage
2038,298-126791-0056.flac,a good motherly lady but as to love that is a matter of taste a few years younger with deference to her prudence and experience would accord better with my fancy she must be under twenty said the other quickly it depends on the way you count if you begin at the heel of life well
2039,298-126791-0034.flac,and as it was without the powder it was then the fashion to wear it fell in raven blackness a few of its locks had fallen on her cheek giving its chilling whiteness by the contrast a more deadly character
2040,298-126791-0046.flac,doubtless it is his duty twas said above a royal party was moving on the river though i passed the troops but two miles from this spot the latter part of the sentence was hardly audible and it was spoken more in the manner of a soliloquy than as if for the ears of her companions
2041,298-126791-0012.flac,as he inquired with a brevity that would have honored lieutenant mason had it petticoats george i saw nothing but its heavenly eyes its bloom its majestic step its grace replied the young man with rather more ardor than his surgeon thought consistent with his debilitated condition
2042,298-126791-0037.flac,the feeling was communicated to all the spectators and they dispersed in pursuit of their usual avocations isabella yielded to the gentle influence of frances without resistance
2043,298-126791-0062.flac,wharton knew that their misfortune as they both termed their defeat was owing to the other's rashness but he forbore to speak of anything except the unfortunate accident which had deprived the english of their leader and to which he good naturedly ascribed their subsequent discomfiture
2044,298-126791-0031.flac,the color of frances changed as the vehicle gradually drew nearer and when she was enabled to see a female form in it by the side of a black in livery her limbs shook with an agitation that compelled her to lean on sarah for support in a few minutes the travelers approached the gate
2045,298-126791-0015.flac,the major considerate dunwoodie murmured the exhausted youth sinking again on his pillow where the commands of his attendant compelled him to remain silent even captain lawton had been received with many and courteous inquiries after the state of his health
2046,298-126791-0000.flac,the morning found them all restored in some measure to their former ease of body with the exception of the youthful captain of dragoons who had been so deeply regretted by dunwoodie the wound of this officer was severe though the surgeon persevered in saying that it was without danger
2047,298-126790-0017.flac,but then i have left my wages for three years past in the hands of harvey and how am i to get them my brothers told me again and again to ask for my money but i always thought accounts between relations were easily settled were you related then to berch asked miss peyton observing her to pause
2048,298-126790-0021.flac,the surgeon drew up and employed himself in whistling a low air as he looked over some vials on a table but the housekeeper turning to him with an inclination of the head continued i suppose sir a woman has no dower in her husband's property unless they be actually married
2049,298-126790-0027.flac,but i suppose his time had come and when that happens it matters but little what doctor's stuff we take let me set you right in that particular interrupted the surgeon we must all die it is true but it has permitted us to use the lights of science in arresting dangers as they occur until
2050,298-126790-0015.flac,replied twas the troubles of the times and the loss of property that brought him down he wasted from day to day and all my care and anxiety were lost for now harvey is no better than a beggar and who is there to pay me for what i have done
2051,298-126790-0034.flac,for my part i am clear for doctoring though harvey says i am killing myself with medicines
2052,298-126790-0005.flac,startled the prudent surgeon and warned him of a trite saying in the corps that captain lawton always slept with one eye open this group had assembled in one of the parlors as the sun made its appearance over the eastern hill dispersing the columns of fog which had enveloped the lowland
2053,298-126790-0037.flac,and as such was highly pleased with what he said
2054,298-126790-0016.flac,god will reward you for all the good you have done said miss peyton mildly yes interrupted the spinster hastily and with an air of reverence that was instantly succeeded by an expression that denoted more of worldly care
2055,298-126790-0009.flac,katy is he gone no ma'am replied the disturbed damsel with great bitterness he is not yet gone but he may go as soon as he pleases now for the worst is done
2056,298-126790-0022.flac,it was a maxim with doctor sitgreaves that no species of knowledge was to be despised and consequently he was an empiric in everything but his profession at first indignation at the irony of his comrade kept him silent but suddenly changing his purpose
2057,298-126790-0010.flac,and those he has honour none of the best i can tell you how exclaimed the other astonished could any one have the heart to plunder a man in such distress hearts repeated katy catching her breath men like them have no bowels at all plunder and distress indeed
2058,298-126790-0029.flac,who administered to the case no one yet said the housekeeper with quickness i expect he has made his last will and testament the surgeon disregarded the smile of the ladies and pursued his inquiries it is doubtless wise to be prepared for death but under whose care was the sick man during his indisposition
2059,298-126790-0035.flac,therein you show your sense said the surgeon approaching the spinster who sat holding the palms of her hands on the soles of her feet to the genial heat of a fine fire making the most of comfort amid all her troubles
2060,298-126790-0001.flac,but frequently through a dread of future depredations from the commiseration of their neighbours also additional duties had drawn the ladies from their pillows at an hour somewhat earlier than usual and captain lawton
2061,298-126790-0039.flac,in the absence of more enlightened counsellors the experience of a discreet matron is frequently of great efficacy in checking the progress of disease under such circumstances madame it is dreadful to have to contend with ignorance and obstinacy
2062,298-126790-0019.flac,piercing eyes lowering at her through his thick brows in silence perhaps this gentleman knows he seems to take an interest in my story madame said the trooper bowing very low both you and the tail are extremely interesting katy smiled involuntarily
2063,298-126790-0026.flac,and fearful the conversation would cease he inquired with an appearance of great interest you think it was age and debility that removed the old gentleman at last and the troublesome times trouble is a heavy pull down to a sick bed
2064,298-126790-0043.flac,i tell harvey his conduct is often condemnable and last night he made my words good but the opinions of such unbelievers is not very consequential yet it is dreadful to think how he behaves at times now when he threw away the needle
2065,298-126790-0008.flac,that seemed so overwhelming a nearer view of the disturbed features of the visitor confirmed miss peyton in her belief and with the shock that gentle feelings ever experienced at a sudden and endless separation from even the meanest of their associates she said hastily
2066,298-126790-0012.flac,besides what might have been in the deerskin purse but harvey is little better now than a beggar and a beggar miss jeannette is the most awfully despisable of all earthly creatures
2067,298-126790-0033.flac,doctor sitgreaves does not mean a regular soldier but a regular physician madame said the trooper oh cried the maiden again correcting herself for the best of all reasons there was none to be had so i took care of him myself
2068,298-126790-0011.flac,why ma'am there were in the iron pot in plain sight fifty four guineas of gold besides what lay underneath which i couldn't count without handling and i didn't like to touch it for they say that another's gold is apt to stick so judging from that in sight there wasn't less than two hundred guineas
2069,298-126790-0041.flac,indeed i can easily comprehend the mortification you must have felt in having one so self willed to deal with returned the surgeon glancing his eyes reproachfully at his comrade but you should rise superior to such opinions and pity the ignorance by which they are engendered
2070,298-126790-0002.flac,notwithstanding the sufferings of his body had risen in compliance with a rule from which he never departed of sleeping but six hours at a time this was one of the few points in which the care of the human frame was involved on which the trooper and the surgeon of horse were ever known to agree
2071,298-126790-0042.flac,the housekeeper hesitated a moment at a loss to comprehend all that the surgeon expressed yet she felt it was both complimentary and kind therefore suppressing her natural flow of language a little she replied
2072,298-126790-0040.flac,harvey is as obstinate about such things as a dumb beast one would think the care i took of his bed ridden father might learn him better than to despise good nursing but some day he may know what it is to want a careful woman in his house though now i am sure he is too despisable himself to have a house
2073,298-126790-0020.flac,but my humble knowledge is limited to the setting of a squadron in the field and using it when there i beg leave to refer you to doctor archibald sitgreaves a gentleman of universal attainments and unbounded philanthropy the very milk of human sympathies and a mortal foe to all indiscriminate cutting
2074,298-126790-0024.flac,to this part of his speech then she directed her reply i did think he only waited the death of the old gentleman before he married said the housekeeper looking on the carpet but now he is nothing more than despisable or what's the same thing a peddler without housepack or money
2075,298-126790-0032.flac,i'm sure harvey has suffered enough already from having so much concerns with the wrigg'lars replied the housekeeper he has lost his all and made himself a vagabond through the land and i have reason to rue the day i ever crossed the threshold of his house
2076,298-126790-0031.flac,i doctored him mostly with yarbs said the housekeeper smiling as if conscious of error with simples returned the surgeon they are safer in the hands of the unlettered than more powerful remedies but why had you no regular attendant
2077,298-126790-0007.flac,and was seen making hasty steps towards the locusts there was that in the air of the housekeeper which bespoke distress of an unusual nature and the kind hearted mistress of the locusts opened the door of the room with the benevolent intention of soothing a grief
2078,298-126790-0044.flac,what said the surgeon interrupting her does he effect to despise the needle but it is my lot to meet with men daily who are equally perverse and who show a still more culpable disrespect for the information that flows from the lights of science
2079,298-126790-0025.flac,it might be hard for a man to get a wife at all in such a predicary don't you think it would miss peyton i seldom trouble myself with such things said the lady gravely during this dialogue captain lawton had been studying the countenance and manner of the housekeeper with a most ludicrous gravity
2080,298-126790-0004.flac,tolerated the interruptions with a very ill grace and once for an instant he ventured to steal softly to the bed of his obstinate comrade and was near succeeding in obtaining a touch of his pulse when a terrible oath sworn by the trooper in a dream
2081,298-126790-0014.flac,he died about two hours and ten minutes before the cock crowed as near as we can say she was interrupted by the physician who approaching inquired with much interest the nature of the disorder glancing her eye over the figure of this new acquaintance katy instinctively adjusted her dress
2082,298-126790-0006.flac,miss peyton was looking from a window in the direction of the tenement of the peddler and was expressing a kind anxiety after the welfare of the sick man when the person of katy suddenly emerged from the dense covering of an earthly cloud whose mists were scattering before the cheering rays of the sun
2083,298-126790-0023.flac,he answered the applicant with a good natured smile i judge not if death has anticipated your nuptials i'm fearful you have no remedy against his stern decrees to katy this sounded well although she understood nothing of its meaning but death and nuptials
2084,298-126790-0030.flac,under mine answered katy with an air of a little importance and care thrown away i may well call it for harvey is quite too despisable to be any sort of compensation at present the mutual ignorance of each other's meaning made very little interruption to the dialogue
2085,298-126790-0028.flac,we can die secundum artum cried the trooper to this observation the physician did not deign to reply but deeming it necessary to his professional dignity that the conversation should continue he added perhaps in this instance judicious treatment might have prolonged the life of the patient
2086,298-126790-0018.flac,why returned the housekeeper hesitating a little i thought we were as good as so i wonder if i have no claim on the house and garden though they say now it is harveys it will surely be confiscated turning to lawton who had been sitting in one posture with his
2087,298-126790-0036.flac,you appear to be a sensible discreet woman and some who have had opportunities of acquiring more correct views might envy you your respect for knowledge and the lights of science although the housekeeper did not altogether comprehend the other's meaning she knew he used a compliment
2088,298-126790-0013.flac,the countenance of katy changed from the natural expression of concern to the set form of melancholy as she answered he is happily removed from the cares of the world the chinking of the money made him get out of his bed and the poor soul found the shock too great for him
2089,298-126790-0003.flac,the doctor had watched during the night by the side of the bed of captain singleton without once closing his eyes occasionally he would pay a visit to the wounded englishman who being more hurt in the spirit than in the flesh
2090,298-126790-0038.flac,it was always said of me that i wanted nothing but opportunity to make quite a physician myself so long as before i came to live with harvey's father they called me the petticoat doctor more true than civil i dare say returned the surgeon losing sight of the woman's character in his admiration of her respect for the healing art
2091,298-126790-0000.flac,the family at the locusts had slept or watched through all the disturbances at the cottage of birch in perfect ignorance of their occurrence the attacks of the skinners were always made with so much privacy as to exclude the sufferers
2092,2289-152258-0016.flac,in a cave on munt hera near mecca he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious meditation he declared that while praying in his cave he often had visions of god and heaven

2096,2289-152258-0012.flac,kadijah then engaged him as the manager of her business and he served her well and faithfully she thought a great deal of him
2097,2289-152258-0021.flac,soon afterwards he began to preach to the people he spoke in the market and other public places
2098,2289-152258-0011.flac,are you willing to take charge of my caravans and give your whole time and service to me mohammed was delighted
2099,2289-152258-0009.flac,as quickly as possible he went to the house of kadijah for he was well pleased at the thought of being employed in so important a service
2100,2289-152258-0028.flac,that mohammed fled from mecca this event is very important in the mohammedan history it is called the flight of the prophet or the hejira

2104,2289-152258-0006.flac,and sold there the goods carried by the camels
2105,2289-152258-0040.flac,and this title has been born ever since by the religious chief of the mohammedans in modern times the sultans or rulers of turkey
2106,2289-152258-0004.flac,and he soon became a skilful camel driver mohammed was very faithful and honest in all his work he always spoke the truth and never broke a promise i have given my promise he would say and i must keep it
2107,2289-152258-0033.flac,that the coffin of mohammed rests somewhere between heaven and earth suspended in the air but this fable was invented by enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion
2108,2289-152258-0025.flac,people came from distant parts of arabia and from neighboring countries to hear him one day six of the chief men of medina
2109,2289-152258-0029.flac,the remainder of his life a splendid church was built for him in medina it was called a mosque and all the mohammedan churches or places of worship
2110,2289-152258-0038.flac,but has become dark from being wept upon and touched by so many millions of pilgrims it really is reddish brown in color before the time of mohammed the ka'ba was a pagan temple
2111,2289-152258-0026.flac,about this time mohammed's uncle and wife died and he had then hardly any friends in mecca he therefore resolved to leave that city and go to medina numbers of the people there believed his doctrines

2121,2289-152258-0005.flac,that people gave him the name of el amin which means the truthful at this time he was only sixteen years of age but the rich traders had so much confidence in him that they gave him important business to attend to and trusted him with large sums of money

2148,2289-152253-0025.flac,here i will perish in the flames he cried rather than surrender to my enemies
2149,2289-152253-0017.flac,were not safe without high and strong walls attila tried to take orleans but soon after he began to attack the walls he saw a great army at a distance coming towards the city
2150,2289-152253-0005.flac,but he was young and full of spirit and very soon he remembered only what had been said to him about his becoming a great and famous conqueror and began to prepare for war he gathered together the best men
2151,2289-152253-0024.flac,when attila reached his camp he had all his baggage and waggons gathered in a great heap he intended to set fire to it and jump into the flames if the romans should come there to attack him
2152,2289-152253-0012.flac,this made peace but the peace did not last long in a few years attila appeared at the head of an army of seven hundred thousand men with this great force he marched across germany and into gaul
2153,2289-152253-0009.flac,the roman emperor theodosius had to ask for terms of peace attil agreed that there should be peace but soon afterwards he found out that theodosius had formed a plaw to murder him
2154,2289-152253-0027.flac,and they had no army strong enough to send against him rome would have been again destroyed if it had not been for pope leo
2155,2289-152253-0010.flac,he was so enraged at this that he again began war
2156,2289-152253-0023.flac,and attila himself fled to his camp it was the first time he had ever been defeated thorismond the conqueror was lifted upon his shield on the battle field and hailed as king of the visigoths
2157,2289-152253-0026.flac,very soon however he was again on the war path this time he invaded italy
2158,2289-152253-0006.flac,from the various tribes of his people and trained them into a great army of good soldiers two about this time one of the king's shepherds while taking care of cattle in the fields
2159,2289-152253-0022.flac,when his father was killed and now he led them on to fight they were all eager to have revenge for the death of their king so they fought like lions and swept across the plain with great fury the huns were soon beaten on every side
2160,2289-152253-0014.flac,attila and his terrible huns marched through gaul until they came to the city of orleans here the people bravely resisted the invaders they shut their gates and defended themselves in every way they could
2161,2289-152253-0029.flac,they enclosed his body in three coffins one of gold one of silver and one of iron
2162,2289-152253-0003.flac,one day shortly after he became king attila went to the cave to get his fortune told wise man said he look into the future and tell me what is before me in the path of life the hermit thought for a few moments and then said
2163,2289-152253-0018.flac,the army which attila saw was an army of three hundred thousand romans and visigoths it was led by a roman general
2164,2289-152254-0009.flac,after ruling several years valentinian had just been murdered by a roman noble named maximus who had at once made himself emperor when the messenger entered the room where genseric was he said great king
2165,2289-152254-0015.flac,but since then rome had become again grand and wealthy so there was plenty for genseric and his vandals to carry away they spent fourteen days in the work of plunder they sacked the temples
2166,2289-152254-0012.flac,i shall set out for rome immediately i shall protect udoxia and her friends genseric then got ready a fleet and a great army and sailed across the mediterranean
2167,2289-152254-0008.flac,he built great fleets and sailed over the mediterranean capturing trading vessels for many years he plundered towns along the coasts
2168,2289-152254-0022.flac,but genseric did not wait for the roman fleet to come to attack him in his capital when he got word that it was in the bay of carthagena he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single day burned or sank nearly all the roman ships
2169,2289-152254-0023.flac,after this the vandals became more than ever the terror of the mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it every year their ships went round the coasts from asia minor to spain attacking and plundering cities on their way
2170,2289-152254-0026.flac,the brother of emperor leo's wife basilicus sailed with his ships to africa and landed the army not far from carthage genseric asked for a truce for five days to consider terms of peace and the truce was granted
2171,2289-152254-0003.flac,he also sent a letter to genseric inviting him to come to africa with an army genseric was greatly delighted to receive the invitation from boniface he had long wanted to attack rome and take from her some of the rich countries she had conquered
2172,2289-152254-0014.flac,it was only forty five years since alaric had been there
2173,2289-152254-0017.flac,some years after the capture of rome by genseric there was a roman emperor named majorian he was a good ruler and a brave man the vandals still continued to attack and plunder cities in italy
2174,2289-152254-0020.flac,as he went along before sailing with his army for carthage he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people the vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was generally believed
2175,2289-152254-0028.flac,in among the roman ships towing behind them large boats filled with material that would easily burn these boats were set on fire and floated against the roman vessels which also were soon on fire the flames quickly spread
2176,2289-152254-0000.flac,when he was but twenty one years of age he was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very ordinary person like most of the vandals he was a cruel and cunning man but he had great ability in many ways
2177,2289-152254-0024.flac,and carrying off prisoners all the efforts of the romans failed to put a stop to these ravages the emperor leo who ruled over the eastern division of the empire fitted out a great fleet at constantinople
2178,2289-152254-0004.flac,and marched into other parts of the coast and captured towns and cities by this time boniface had learned all about the wicked plod of ateus he now regretted having invited the vandals to africa and tried to induce them to return to spain
2179,2289-152254-0002.flac,and that he was going to make war against rome at the same time he wrote secretly to count boniface and told him that if he came to rome the empress would put him to death boniface believed this story
2180,2289-152254-0021.flac,and entertained him hospitably not knowing that he was the emperor majorian of course peace was not made the emperor left carthage after having got as much information as he could
2181,2289-152254-0010.flac,i bring you a message from the empress eudoxia she begs your help she and her two beautiful daughters are in danger in rome she wishes you to protect them against maximus she invites you to come with an army to rome and take the city
2182,2289-152254-0005.flac,but genseric sternly refused never he said shall i go back to spain until i am master of africa then cried boniface i will drive you back soon afterwr there was a battle between the romans and vandals and the romans were defeated
2183,2289-152254-0016.flac,and public buildings and private houses
2184,2289-152254-0025.flac,to make another attempt to suppress the pirates there were more than a thousand ships in this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men
2185,2289-152254-0011.flac,she and her friends will help you as much as they can with a cry of joy genseric sprang to his feet and exclaimed tell the empress that i accept her invitation i shall set out for rome immediately
2186,2289-152254-0027.flac,but the cunning vandal was not thinking of peace he only wanted time to carry out a plan he had made to destroy the roman fleet one dark night during the truce he filled the largest of his ships
2187,2289-152254-0013.flac,to the mouth of tiber when the emperor maximus heard that the vandals were coming he prepared to flee from the city and he advised the senate to do the same the people were so angry at this
2188,2289-152254-0029.flac,and in a very short time a great part of the roman fleet was destroyed basilichus fled with as many ships as he could save and return to constantinople this was the last attempt of the romans to conquer the vandals
2189,2289-152254-0019.flac,but he first marched his men across the alps through gaul and down to the seapoard of carthagena in spain where his fleet was stationed he took this route because he expected to add to his forces
2190,2289-152254-0018.flac,and other countries belonging to rome and majorian resolved to punish them so he got together a great army and built a fleet of three hundred ships to carry his troops to carthrage
2191,2289-152254-0006.flac,they were also defeated in several other battles at last they had to flee for safety to two or three towns which the vandals had not yet taken one of these towns was hippo genseric captured this town
2192,2289-152254-0001.flac,but a plot was formed against him
2193,2289-152254-0007.flac,destroyed valuable property a great many of the natives of africa joined the army of genseric they had for a long time been ill treated by the romans and were glad to see them defeated
2194,2289-152257-0013.flac,and nothing was known of the power of steam for moving machinery the ships or galleys were sailing vessels and when there was no wind they could make no progress except by rowing when belisarius reached africa
2195,2289-152257-0022.flac,for a long time the grandest church structure in the world the great temple still exist in all its beauty and grandeur
2196,2289-152257-0017.flac,after conquering the vandals justinian resolved to conquer italy which was then held by the ostrogophs a large army was got together and put under the command of belisarius and narsis who immediately set out for italy
2197,2289-152257-0004.flac,and trudged along the valley in high hope feeling certain that he would reach the end of his journey in safety
2198,2289-152257-0024.flac,for a long time the roman laws had been difficult to understand there was a vast number of them and different writers differed widely as to what the laws really were and what they meant justinian employed a great lawyer named
2199,2289-152257-0027.flac,and a hard worker he often worked or studied all day and all night without eating or sleeping
2200,2289-152257-0015.flac,and preferred to be under the government of the romans about ten miles from carthage he met a large army led by the brother of gelimer a battle immediately took place and the vandals were utterly defeated
2201,2289-152257-0016.flac,gelimer gave himself up to belisarius who took him to constantinople justinian set apart an estate for him to live upon and the conquered king passed the rest of his life in peaceful retirement
2202,2289-152257-0023.flac,the work for which he is most celebrated was the improving and collecting of the laws he made many excellent new laws and reformed many of the old laws so that he became famous as one of the greatest of the world's legislators
2203,2289-152257-0012.flac,that were carried on a fleet of six hundred ships it took this fleet three months to make the voyage from constantinople to africa the same voyage may now be made in a very few days but in the time of belisarius there were no steam ships
2204,2289-152257-0001.flac,but he was determined to go even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live on fruits that he could gather by the way he was a bright clever boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village but was now eager to go out into the world
2205,2289-152257-0021.flac,vitigus retired to ravenna and belisarius quickly followed and made such an assault on the city that it was compelled to surrender the ostrogoth army was captured
2206,2289-152257-0006.flac,and gave him the best education that could be had in the city
2207,2289-152257-0007.flac,richly dressed he was well liked at the emperor's court and was respected by everybody on account of his learning two one day a great change came for both uncle and nephew the emperor died
2208,2289-152257-0026.flac,justinian also did a great deal of good by establishing a number of manufacturers in constantinople it was he who first brought silk worms into europe to the last year of his life justinian was strong and active
2209,2289-152257-0011.flac,he gained wonderful victories for justinian and conquered some of the old roman provinces that had been lost for many years the victories of these two generals largely helped to make the reign of justinian remarkable in history
2210,2289-152257-0010.flac,he was fortunate enough however to have two great generals to lead his armies one of them was named belisarius and the other narsis belisarius was one of the greatest soldiers that ever lived
2211,2289-152257-0019.flac,but in a few months vitiges king of the goths appeared with an army before the gates and challenged belisarius and narses to come out and fight the roman generals however
2212,2289-152257-0008.flac,in ruling the empire justinus agreed to this proposal for he was now old and in feeble health and not able himself to attend to the important affairs of government
2213,2289-152257-0003.flac,commander of the imperial guard which attended the emperor the poor shepherd boy had heard of the success of his uncle and this was the reason why he resolved to set out for the big city so he started down the mountain
2214,2289-152257-0025.flac,tribonian to collect and simplify the principal laws the collection which he made was called the code of justinian it still exists and is the model according to which most of the countries of europe have made their laws
2215,2289-152257-0018.flac,when they arrived there they marched straight to rome and after some fighting
2216,2289-152257-0002.flac,to seek his fortune some years before this boy's uncle who was named justin had gone to constantinople and joined the roman army he was so brave and so good a soldier that he soon came to be
2217,2289-152257-0009.flac,justinian reigned for nearly forty years and did so many important things that he was afterwards called justinian the great he had many wars during his reign but he himself did not take part in them
2218,2289-152257-0005.flac,and to cross rivers and high hills but at last one afternoon in midsummer he walked through the main gate of constantinople proud and happy that he had accomplished his purpose he had no trouble in finding his uncle justin
2219,2289-152257-0014.flac,he left five men as a guard in each vessel and with the body of his army he marched for some days along the coast the people received him in a friendly way for they had grown tired of the rule of the vandals
2220,2289-152257-0000.flac,in the time of clovis the country now called bulgaria was inhabited by goths one day a poor shepherd boy about sixteen years of age left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of constantinople which was many miles away
2221,2289-152257-0020.flac,laid siege to the city thinking that he would compel the romans to surrender but instead of having any thought of surrender belisarius was preparing his men for fight and when they were ready he attacked vitigus and defeated him
2222,1081-125237-0056.flac,tromp succeeded by expert seamanship in holding off the enemy and conducting his convoy with small loss into safety
2223,1081-125237-0042.flac,all of them being captured or burnt while blake with the main force off the north coast of scotland destroyed the dutch fishing fleet and their convoy after these first blows against the enemy's commerce good fortune continued to attend the english
2224,1081-125237-0091.flac,the treaty ratified and signed was sent back to london only one article aroused opposition
2225,1081-125237-0105.flac,all the secret instructions they had received from holland and the act of exclusion meanwhile the estates of holland themselves frightened at the clamor which had been aroused began to show signs of defection
2226,1081-125237-0032.flac,but popular feeling on both sides was now aroused
2227,1081-125237-0034.flac,all of the advantages were on the side of their enemies the dutch merchant fleets covered the seas and the welfare of the land depended on commerce the english had little to lose commercially
2228,1081-125237-0065.flac,and their insistence now on the full satisfaction of all the english demands made a continuation of hostilities inevitable tromp after successfully bringing te two large convoys of merchantmen encountered june twelfth
2229,1081-125237-0036.flac,it had been largely increased by the parliament after sixteen forty eight and its generals blake pen and ayscue had already acquired much valuable experience in their encounters with the royalist squadron under prince rupert
2230,1081-125237-0025.flac,who in pursuance of economy had reduced the fleet to seventy five ships it was resolved therefore on february twenty second
2231,1081-125237-0050.flac,but they were deceived in thinking that the struggle in the channel was over for the winter the deserters at the kentish knock were punished
2232,1081-125237-0097.flac,to the act of exclusion came upon the estates like a thunderbolt the sudden demand caused something like consternation and the members asked to be allowed to consider the matter with their principles before taking so momentous a decision three days were granted
2233,1081-125237-0068.flac,the english now instituted a blockade of the dutch coast which had the effect of reducing to desperate straits a land whose welfare and prosperity depended wholly on commerce amsterdam was ruined in these circumstances direct negotiation was perforce attempted
2234,1081-125237-0083.flac,not till the dutch envoys had demanded their passports did the protector give way so far as to say he would be content to have the exclusion guaranteed by a secret article what followed forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of diplomacy
2235,1081-125237-0026.flac,the council of state on hearing of this began also to make ready for eventualities negotiations were still proceeding between the two countries when martin tromp the victor of the battle of the downs
2236,1081-125237-0080.flac,was perfectly aware that it would be useless to present such proposals to the states general not only would they indignantly reject them but he had not the slightest hope of getting any single province even holland to allow a foreign power to interfere with their internal affairs
2237,1081-125237-0102.flac,but for some five weeks the existence of the act was unknown to the states general and during that period
2238,1081-125237-0059.flac,destroyed a british squadron off leghorn march twenty third in both countries there was a peace party
2239,1081-125237-0041.flac,he left ayscue with a small squadron to guard the mouth of the thames tromp meanwhile had put to sea at the head of nearly a hundred ships ayscue succeeded in intercepting a fleet of dutch merchantmen near calais
2240,1081-125237-0022.flac,they further demanded that the dutch commanders should acknowledge england's sovereignty by striking flag and sail and by firing a salute whenever any of their squadrons met english ships in the narrow seas it was these last two questions
2241,1081-125237-0051.flac,full of resentment though he was at the bad treatment he had received tromp was too good a patriot to refuse at the end of november the old admiral at the head of one hundred warships put to sea for the purpose of conveying some four hundred fifty merchantmen through the straits
2242,1081-125237-0104.flac,all the other provinces strongly protested against the action of the estates of holland and of the council pensionary de witt attempted to defend himself and the estates by vague statements avoiding the main issue but insisting that nothing illegal had been done his efforts were in vain
2243,1081-125237-0035.flac,was superior in almost all other respects the stuarts had devoted great attention to the fleet and would have done more but for lack of means charles much abused ship money was employed by him for the creation of the first english professional navy
2244,1081-125237-0081.flac,and to bid them to treat with harsh ingratitude the infant heir of a family to which the dutch people owed so deep a debt there was nothing for it but to prepare for a vigorous resumption of the war strong efforts were therefore made at de witt's instigation
2245,1081-125237-0040.flac,early in july sixteen fifty two blake at the head of sixty ships set sail for the north to intercept the dutch baltic commerce and to destroy their fishing fleet off the north of scotland
2246,1081-125237-0048.flac,and as the orange partisans were everywhere clamorously active the admiral was suspect in his place cornelis witte de wit was appointed a capable sailor but disliked in the fleet as much as tromp was beloved de wit affected a junction with de royter
2247,1081-125237-0098.flac,but as it was essential to prevent publicity it was settled that only the burgomaster should be consulted again under oath of secrecy at the meeting on may first
2248,1081-125237-0111.flac,and the risk of a renewal of the war no further action was taken and the protector professed himself satisfied with a guarantee of such doubtful validity it is impossible to withhold admiration from de witt's marvellous diplomatic dexterity
2249,1081-125237-0112.flac,and from the skill and courage with which he achieved his end in the face of obstacles and difficulties that seemed insurmountable but for the course of double dealing in chicanery by which he triumphed the only defence that can be offered is that the council pensionary
2250,1081-125237-0037.flac,and in long cruises to the west indies for the purpose of forcing the english colonies to acknowledge parliamentary rule the crews therefore were well trained and the ships were larger stronger and better armed than those of the dutch
2251,1081-125237-0069.flac,four envoys were sent representing the three maritine provinces at first it seemed impossible that any common ground of agreement could be found cromwell was obsessed with the idea of a politico religious union between the two republics which would have meant the extinction of the dutch independence
2252,1081-125237-0074.flac,the states though much perplexed to find a successor to martin tromp were so far from being discouraged that great energy was shown in reorganizing the fleet
2253,1081-125237-0079.flac,article twelve stipulated that the prince of orange should not at any time hold any of the offices or dignities which had been held by his ancestors or be appointed to any military command
2254,1081-125237-0029.flac,tromp declared that he had given orders to strike the flag but that blake again fired before there was time to carry them out be this as it may the two fleets were soon engaged in a regular fight and the english being reinforced tromp withdrew at nightfall
2255,1081-125237-0060.flac,and was averse to war in the dutch republic the states party especially in holland the chief sufferer by the war was anxious for a cessation of hostilities and it found its leader in the youthful john de wit
2256,1081-125237-0088.flac,the council pensionary first set to work to have the treaty from which the exclusion article had been cut out ratified rapidly by the states general
2257,1081-125237-0101.flac,and overruled their protest the act was declared to have been passed and was on may fifth sent to van berveninga and newport with instructions not to deliver it until circumstances compelled them to do so
2258,1081-125237-0021.flac,the english government however meant the dutch complaints by raking up the long list of grievances that had stirred up a bitter feeling of popular hatred against the united provinces in england and by demanding reparation
2259,1081-125237-0090.flac,and such was his persuasive skill that he accomplished the unprecedented feat of getting this diliatory body to accept the conditions of peace almost without discussion
2260,1081-125237-0043.flac,tromp was prevented from following blake by strong northerly winds he then turned upon ayscue whose small force he must have overwhelmed but for a sudden change to a southerly gale the dutch admiral now sailed northwards and july twenty fifth
2261,1081-125237-0044.flac,found the english fleet off the shetlands a violent storm arose from the force of which blake was protected while the dutch vessels were scattered far and wide on the following day out of ninety nine ships tromp could only collect thirty five
2262,1081-125237-0093.flac,or commander of military or naval forces
2263,1081-125237-0075.flac,meanwhile negotiations had been slowly dragging on the accession of cromwell to supreme power in december sixteen fifty three with the title of lord protector
2264,1081-125237-0103.flac,early in june a bribe induced one of de witt's clerks to betray the secret to count william frederick the news soon spread and loud was the outcry of the orange partisans and of the two princesses who at once addressed a remonstrance to the states general
2265,1081-125237-0057.flac,meanwhile both nations had been getting sick of the war the dutch were suffering terribly from the serious interference with their commerce in carrying trade and from the destruction of the important fisheries industry
2266,1081-125237-0110.flac,while the clerk was laboriously deciphering the despatch the envoys read between the lines of de witt's letter and without a moment's delay went to whitehall and placed the act in cromwell's hands the states general had thus no alternative between acceptance of the faetea comple
2267,1081-125237-0089.flac,the estates adjourned for a recess on april twenty first sixteen fifty four on the following day he presented the treaty to the states general
2268,1081-125237-0071.flac,but in order to gain breathing space for the efforts of the negotiators one thing was essential the breaking of the blockade the admiralties made a supreme effort to refit and reinforce their fleet but it lay in two portions eighty five sail under tromp in the mass
2269,1081-125237-0100.flac,de witt succeeded after an angry debate in securing a majority for the act five towns however obstinately refused their assent and claimed that it could not be passed without it but de witt had made up his mind to risk illegality
2270,1081-125237-0049.flac,and with joint forces they attacked blake on october eighth near the shoal known as the kentish knock the english fleet was considerably more powerful than the dutch and the desertion of de wit by some twenty ships decided the issue the dutch had to return home with some loss
2271,1081-125237-0077.flac,at last cromwell formulated his proposals in twenty seven articles the demands were those of the victor and were severe all the old disputes were to be settled in favor of england an annual sum was to be paid for the right of fishing
2272,1081-125237-0067.flac,tromp was obliged to retreat having lost twenty ships he complained bitterly as did his vice admirals deruyter and de wit to the board of admiralty of the inferiority of the vessels of his fleet as compared with those of the adversary
2273,1081-125237-0038.flac,the position of england lying as it did athwart the routes by which the dutch merchant fleets must sail was a great advantage even more important was the advantage of having a central control
2274,1081-125237-0031.flac,adrian pau himself left hastily for london jon de whitt being appointed to act as his deputy during his absence pau's strenuous efforts however to maintain peace were all in vain despite the strong leanings of cromwell towards a peaceful solution
2275,1081-125237-0047.flac,the ill success of tromp though he was in no way to blame for it caused considerable alarm and discontent in holland his enemies of the states party in that province took advantage of it to suspend the gallant old seaman from his command he was an orangist
2276,1081-125237-0095.flac,the cleverness and skill now shown by the council pensionary were truly extraordinary a summons was sent out to the estates to meet on april twenty eighth without any reason being assigned the members on assembly were sworn to secrecy
2277,1081-125237-0045.flac,and to meet and convoy back the home coming ships
2278,1081-125237-0092.flac,the so called temperament clause but cromwell had insisted upon it by this article
2279,1081-125237-0082.flac,to increase the fleet and secure the active co operation of denmark and france both friendly to the states but cromwell really wanted peace and showed himself ready to yield on certain minor points but he continued to insist on the exclusion of the prince of orange
2280,1081-125237-0108.flac,this was agreed to and on june seventh the document was duly forwarded to london by the council pensionary
2281,1081-125237-0114.flac,there is however every reason to believe that de witt was prompted to take the risks he did by purely patriotic motives and not through spite against the house of orange
2282,1081-125237-0024.flac,not merely by privateers but by an english squadron under eiccue in the west indies had caused intense indignation and alarm in holland and especially in amsterdam pressure was brought to bear on the states general and the admiralties
2283,1081-125237-0084.flac,he was able to reach the private ear of cromwell and to enter into clandestine negotiations with him the council pensionary knew well the hopelessness of any attempt to get the assent of the states general to the proposed exclusion even in a secret article
2284,1081-125237-0073.flac,the old hero fell mortally wounded at the very beginning of what proved to be an unequal fight
2285,1081-125237-0096.flac,and then the official letter from london was read to them
2286,1081-125237-0053.flac,while many english prizes were captured this state of things was however not to last long towards the end of february sixteen fifty three blake put to sea with nearly eighty ships and on the twenty fifth of portland met tromp at the head of a force nearly equal to his own in number
2287,1081-125237-0066.flac,near the gabard the english fleet under monk and dean each fleet numbered about one hundred sail but the dutch ships were inferior in size solidity and weight of metal for two days the fight was obstinately and fiercely contested
2288,1081-125237-0030.flac,to the french coast having lost two ships great was the anger aroused in england where the dutch were universally regarded as the aggressors in the netherlands where the peace party was strong many were disposed to blame tromp despite his protests
2289,1081-125237-0070.flac,una republica which nothing but sheer conquest and dire necessity would ever induce the dutch people to accept accordingly the war went on though the envoys did not leave london hoping still that some better terms might be offered
2290,1081-125237-0085.flac,of the state of public feeling on this point with the result that the protector gave the envoy to understand that he would be satisfied if the estates of holland alone would affirm a declaration that the prince should never be appointed statholder or captain general whether this concession was offered by cromwell proprio motu
2291,1081-125237-0055.flac,had lasted for two whole days when tromp found that his powder had run out and that on the third day more than half his fleet were unable to continue the struggle but inspiring his subordinates de ruyter evertzen and flerizun with his own indomitable courage
2292,1081-125237-0020.flac,who having been given letters of marqu to prey upon french commerce
2293,1081-125237-0052.flac,stormy weather compelled him to send the convoy with an escort into shelter but he himself with sixty ships set out to seek the english fleet which lay in the downs after some manoeuvering the two fleets met on december tenth off dungeoness
2294,1081-125237-0107.flac,his efforts to prevent the resolution of the states general from taking immediate effect proving unavailing he put forward the suggestion that on the account of its importance the despatch should be sent to the envoys in cipher
2295,1081-125237-0028.flac,it came suddenly through a misunderstanding the dutch admiral while cruising pastdover met on may twenty ninth fifteen english ships under blake
2296,1081-125237-0086.flac,in any case the council pensionary being convinced of the necessity of peace resolved to secure it by playing a very deep and dangerous game not only must the whole affair be kept absolutely from the cognizance of the states general
2297,1081-125237-0062.flac,thus early did the new council pensionary initiate a form of diplomacy in which he was to prove himself an adapt this first effort was not a success the parliament published the letter with the title humble supplication of the states of holland
2298,1081-125237-0106.flac,they went so far as to pass a vote of thanks to the envoys for not having delivered the act to cromwell de witt's position appeared hopeless
2299,1081-125237-0033.flac,if humiliating terms were submitted to stiffened their attitude the result was that the envoys left london on june thirtieth sixteen fifty two and war was declared the dutch statesmen who sought to avoid hostilities were right
2300,1081-125237-0027.flac,now lieutenant admiral of holland was sent to sea with fifty ships and instructions to protect dutch merchantmen from interference and to see that the states suffered no affront nothing was actually said about the striking of the flag
2301,1081-125237-0061.flac,had been appointed council pensionary cromwell took pains to let the estates of holland know his favourable feelings towards them by sending over in february a private emissary
2302,1081-125237-0078.flac,compensation to be made for the massacre of amboyna and the officials responsible for it punished the number of warships in english waters was to be limited the flag had to be struck when english ships were met and the right of search to be permitted these demands
2303,1081-125237-0076.flac,for the new ruler of england had always professed himself an appointment of the war which had shattered his fantastic dream of a union between the two republics many conferences took place but the protector's attitude and intentions were ambiguous and difficult to divine
2304,1081-125237-0094.flac,addressed to the estates of holland not at the moment in session
2305,1081-125237-0046.flac,ayscue had previously sailed up the channel with forty men of war and five fire ships for a similar purpose the two fleets met on august sixteenth and despite his inferiority of force de ruyter forced ayscue to withdraw into plymouth and was able to bring his convoy home to safety
2306,1081-125237-0023.flac,the right of search and the striking of the flag that were to be the real causes of the outbreak of a war that was desired by neither of the two governments but popular feeling and the course of events was too strong for them the news of the seizure of their vessels
2307,1081-125237-0064.flac,with the support of the army of dictatorial powers
2308,1081-125237-0115.flac,not merely by the orange partisans but by popular opinion generally in the united provinces
2309,1081-125237-0099.flac,that the act should be placed in his hands within two days after the ratification of the treaty was peremptory and threatening unless he received the act he would consider the treaty as not binding upon him using all his powers of advocacy
2310,1081-125237-0063.flac,he induced the states general by a bare majority four provinces to three to send a conciliatory letter the date of which april thirtieth sixteen fifty three coincided with cromwell's forcible dissolution of the rump parliament and the assumption by him
2311,1081-125237-0087.flac,but also de witt was fully aware that the ascent of the estates of holland to the proposed exclusion article would only be obtained with the greatest difficulty he was to prove himself a very past master in the art of diplomatic chicanery and intrigue
2312,1081-125237-0054.flac,and he had moreover been at sea without replenishment of stores ever since the fight at dungeoness while the english had come straight from port the fight
2313,1081-125237-0058.flac,while the english on their side were shut out from the baltic where the king of denmark as the ally of the united provinces had closed the sound and from the mediterranean where admiral van galen
2314,1081-125237-0072.flac,monk with about one hundred ships lay between them to prevent their junction on august four tromp sailed out and after a rear guard action off katwik out maneuvered the english commander and joined de wit he now turned and with superior numbers attacked monk off sheveninge
2315,1081-125237-0039.flac,whereas in the netherlands there were five distinct boards of admiralty to some extent jealous of each other and now lacking the supreme direction of an admiral geniral the war began by a series of english successes and of dutch misfortunes
2316,1081-125237-0109.flac,informing them that the estates of holland assented to the request made by the states general and that they were to send back the secret correspondence and also the act if it were still undelivered the result answered to his expectations
2317,1081-125237-0113.flac,really believed that peace was an absolute necessity for his country and that peace could only be maintained at the cost of the act of exclusion
2318,1081-125237-0006.flac,and saint john and strickland greeted with loud cries of regicides and many abusive epithets remembering the fate of dorislar were in fear of their lives
2319,1081-125237-0010.flac,foremost among them prince edward son of the queen of bohemia the parliament threatened to recall the envoys but consented that they should remain on the undertaking of the estates of holland to protect them from further attacks and to punish the offenders

2336,1040-133433-0053.flac,wendy said it with a smile she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane asked one evening it was like this wendy said
2337,1040-133433-0057.flac,he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth he was a little boy and she was grown up she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty
2338,1040-133433-0029.flac,who is tinker bell oh peter she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he was right for fairies don't live long
2339,1040-133433-0014.flac,very soon i don't want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her passionately i don't want to be a man oh wendy's mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard peter said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard
2340,1040-133433-0049.flac,you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying
2341,1040-133433-0027.flac,she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times but new adventures had crowded out the old ones from his mind who is captain hook
2342,1040-133433-0065.flac,for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter was afraid don't turn up the light he cried she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy she was not a little girl heartbroken about him
2343,1040-133433-0033.flac,peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains
2344,1040-133433-0056.flac,wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow then the window blew open as of old
2345,1040-133433-0035.flac,than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys wendy was grown up you need not be sorry for her she was one of the kind that likes to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls
2346,1040-133433-0063.flac,she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass i can't come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly i'll soon teach you again oh peter don't waste the fairy dust on me
2347,1040-133433-0068.flac,i am old peter i am ever so much more than twenty i grew up long ago you promised not to i couldn't help it
2348,1040-133433-0006.flac,but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers
2349,1040-133433-0051.flac,yes which did you like best of all i think i liked the home under the ground best of all
2350,1040-133433-0024.flac,but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor
2351,1040-133433-0062.flac,peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you of course that is why i have come he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
2352,1040-133433-0041.flac,she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself once a week jane's nurse had her evening off
2353,1040-133433-0009.flac,mind you i am not sure that we have a drawing room but we pretend we have and it's all the same hoop la he went off dancing through the house and they all cried hoop la and danced after him searching for the drawing room and i forget whether they found it
2354,1040-133433-0032.flac,perhaps he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying
2355,1040-133433-0050.flac,yes that was it says jane with a big breath and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon
2356,1040-133433-0064.flac,what is it he cried shrinking
2357,1040-133433-0019.flac,tink called out from somewhere round the corner it doesn't matter peter said oh peter you know it matters
2358,1040-133433-0060.flac,john is not here now she gasped is michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at jane
2359,1040-133433-0073.flac,yes i know i came back from my mother he explained to take care to the neverland yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bedpost crowing gloriously
2360,1040-133433-0010.flac,but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him
2361,1040-133433-0066.flac,she was a grown woman smiling at it all
2362,1040-133433-0030.flac,but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter
2363,1040-133433-0003.flac,that you don't do things by halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them the first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing do you think we should be too much of a handful sir because if so we can go away
2364,1040-133433-0044.flac,that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy ah me how time flies does it fly asked the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl
2365,1040-133433-0043.flac,i don't think i see anything to night says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation yes you do says jane
2366,1040-133433-0076.flac,it was already her easiest way of moving about wendy rushed to the window no no she cried it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning
2367,1040-133433-0080.flac,and every spring cleaning time except when he forgets peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland where she tells him stories about himself to which he listens eagerly when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peter's mother in turn
2368,1040-133433-0022.flac,i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones you won't forget me peter will you before spring cleaning time comes of course peter promised and then he flew away he took missus darling's kiss with him
2369,1040-133433-0008.flac,it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in the drawing room if they fitted in we'll fit in sir they assured him then follow the leader he cried gaily
2370,1040-133433-0071.flac,and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane
2371,1040-133433-0075.flac,he does so need a mother jane said yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i good bye said peter to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him
2372,1040-133433-0061.flac,that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her peter looked hullo was it a new one yes boy or girl girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
2373,1040-133433-0000.flac,chapter seventeen when wendy grew up i hope you want to know what became of the other boys they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and wen they had counted five hundred they went up
2374,1040-133433-0078.flac,our last glimpse of her shows her at the window
2375,1040-133433-0013.flac,would you send me to school he inquired craftily yes and then to an office i suppose so
2376,1040-133433-0042.flac,and then it was wendy's part to put jane to bed that was the time for stories it was jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own thus making a tent
2377,1040-133433-0036.flac,all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them you may see the twins and nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella
2378,1040-133433-0055.flac,jane said ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake lucky you said jane and then one night came the tragedy it was the spring of the year
2379,1040-133433-0048.flac,they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow
2380,1040-133433-0018.flac,i shall have tink tink can't go a twentieth part of the way around she reminded him a little tartly
2381,1040-133433-0038.flac,and always had an odd inquiring look
2382,1040-133433-0077.flac,if only i could go with you wendy sighed you see you can't fly said jane of course in the end wendy let them fly away together
2383,1040-133433-0023.flac,the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily funny but she seemed satisfied of course all the boys went to school
2384,1040-133433-0047.flac,or perhaps wendy admits she does see something i do believe she says that it is this nursery i do believe it is says jane go on
2385,1040-133433-0072.flac,boy she said why are you crying peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed hullo he said hullo said jane my name is peter pan he told her
2386,1040-133433-0037.flac,you see that judge and a wig coming out at the iron door that used to be toodles the bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children
2387,1040-133433-0004.flac,father wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him he knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it we could lie doubled up said nibbs i always cut their hair myself said wendy
2388,1040-133433-0054.flac,trying to imitate peter's crow no it wasn't jane said gravely
2389,1040-133433-0012.flac,that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject no about me peter no missus darling came to the window
2390,1040-133433-0079.flac,as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago
2391,1040-133433-0028.flac,when she spoke of the arch enemy don't you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said
2392,1040-133433-0067.flac,then she turned up the light and peter saw he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply what is it he cried again she had to tell him
2393,1040-133433-0039.flac,when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place
2394,1040-133433-0020.flac,may i mummy certainly not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he does so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had asked her from politeness merely
2395,1040-133433-0058.flac,a big woman hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the night gown in which he had seen her first hullo peter
2396,1040-133433-0002.flac,but they forgot about him of course missus darling said at once that she would have them but mister darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he considered six a rather large number i must say he said to wendy
2397,1040-133433-0025.flac,in time they could not even fly after their hats want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed michael believed longer than the other boys
2398,1040-133433-0045.flac,why can't you fly now mother because i am grown up dearest when people grow up they forget the way why do they forget the way because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless
2399,1040-133433-0011.flac,that was what she did hullo wendy good bye he said oh dear are you going away yes you don't feel peter she said falteringly
2400,1040-133433-0034.flac,and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her
2401,1040-133433-0040.flac,who was no longer fond of stairs missus darling was now dead and forgotten there were only two beds in the nursery now janes and her nurses and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away
2402,1040-133433-0001.flac,they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression they stood in a row in front of missus darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them
2403,1040-133433-0052.flac,what was the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing yes but alas he forgot all about me
2404,1040-133433-0074.flac,while jane and her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy she's my mother peter explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look on her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him
2405,1040-133433-0031.flac,but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops next year he did not come for her she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came
2406,1040-133433-0021.flac,long in coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again
2407,1040-133433-0059.flac,she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible something inside her is crying woman woman let go of me hollo where is john he asked suddenly missing the third bed
2408,1040-133433-0017.flac,because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies they live in nests on the tops of trees and the mouve ones are boys and the white ones are girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are
2409,1040-133433-0015.flac,and missus darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her keep back lady
2410,1040-133433-0026.flac,though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from the leaves and berries in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself
2411,1040-133433-0046.flac,it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly what is gay and innocent and heartless
2412,1040-133433-0007.flac,i don't think he is a cypher toodles cried instantly do you think he is a cypher curly no i don't do you think he is a cypher slightly rather not twin what do you think
2413,1040-133433-0016.flac,but where are you going to live with tink an the house we built for wendy the fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights how lovely cried wendy so longingly that missus darling tightened her grip i thought all the fairies were dead missus darling said
2414,1040-133433-0069.flac,no you're not yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby no she's not
2415,1040-133433-0005.flac,george missus darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavorable light then he burst into tears and the truth came out he was as glad to have them as she was he said
2416,2952-408-0001.flac,for a long time he wandered about helplessly and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night when he perceived on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun one of those little hermitages called
2417,2952-408-0028.flac,since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverence sir
2418,2952-408-0011.flac,all then left the house except the priest who went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp tomyo was burning
2419,2952-408-0009.flac,then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the adjoining room having been told of the priest's kind promises came to thank him after which the master of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell
2420,2952-408-0021.flac,the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village answered muso i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment
2421,2952-408-0012.flac,the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village
2422,2952-408-0029.flac,help me by your prayers i entreat you so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant
2423,2952-408-0022.flac,and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject
2424,2952-408-0000.flac,jigininki once when muso kokushi
2425,2952-408-0004.flac,but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man carrying a lighted lantern entered the room respectfully saluted him and said
2426,2952-408-0018.flac,and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been broken heretofore some great misfortune has followed whenever it is obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause
2427,2952-408-0020.flac,what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time muso then inquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked
2428,2952-408-0007.flac,but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death when i came for though i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me i could have performed the service before your departure
2429,2952-408-0013.flac,but when the hush of the night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak
2430,2952-408-0014.flac,he saw that shape lift the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginning at the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body
2431,2952-408-0023.flac,for it was evident that his kind host supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived
2432,2952-408-0025.flac,you need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter said muso you directed me to the village yonder where i was very kindly treated and i thank you for that favour i can give no man shelter the recluse made answer
2433,2952-408-0017.flac,all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible but the law of our village as i told you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place
2434,2952-408-0006.flac,strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village
2435,2952-408-0016.flac,and looked about the room no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverend sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night
2436,2952-408-0026.flac,so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rights only as a matter of business
2437,2952-408-0024.flac,and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed
2438,2952-408-0008.flac,as it is i shall perform the service after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone
2439,2952-408-0005.flac,the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village
2440,2952-408-0027.flac,i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and because of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of ajikininki
2441,2952-408-0010.flac,by the rule of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honourable body while we are unable to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning
2442,2952-408-0019.flac,then muso told of the dim and awful shape that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed
2443,2952-408-0003.flac,this the old man harshly refused but he directed muso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining where lodging and food could be obtained muso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages
2444,2952-408-0015.flac,turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered
2445,2952-408-0002.flac,which are built for solitary priests it seemed to be in ruinous condition but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest from whom he begged the favor of a knight's lodging
2446,2952-407-0016.flac,for the same reason that sister helen made a little man of wax and nail it
2447,2952-407-0021.flac,while the pair were travelling together kajiwaro one day found himself in great straits for want of money and numegae remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it
2448,2952-407-0022.flac,crying out at the same time for three hundred pieces of gold a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping
2449,2952-407-0003.flac,which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and hide it that she might thereafter treasure it always but the chance did not come and she became very unhappy felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life
2450,2952-407-0008.flac,but the bell proved to be a good bell and it bravely withstood their assaults nevertheless the people were not easily discouraged day after day at all hours they continued to ring the bell furiously caring nothing whatever for the protests of the priests
2451,2952-407-0002.flac,but she had not the money necessary whenever she went to the temple she saw her mirror lying in the courtyard behind a railing among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together she knew it by the shochikuba in relief on the back of it those three fortunate emblems of pine bamboo and plum flour
2452,2952-407-0010.flac,or bell of mugen now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied though not described by the verb
2453,2952-407-0000.flac,even to day in the courts of certain japanese temples you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose the largest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the jodo sect at hakata in kushu
2454,2952-407-0006.flac,of course everybody heard of the matter and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt and because of this public exposure of her secret fault the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry and as she could not bear the shame she drowned herself
2455,2952-407-0018.flac,the soles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed and will allow him no rest until he returns of his own accord to put himself at your mercy that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazoraru
2456,2952-407-0013.flac,for example you cannot afford to build a buddhist temple but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple
2457,2952-407-0025.flac,became great and many people followed the example of umegae thereby hoping to emulate her luck
2458,2952-407-0023.flac,afterwards a song was made about umegae's basin of bronze and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day umega no chozuwachitateite
2459,2952-407-0012.flac,to compare to liken but the esoteric meaning is to substitute an imagination one object or action for another so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result
2460,2952-407-0026.flac,as it deserves to be answered take therefore this jar so saying she put the jar into his hands and disappeared into his house the happy man rushed to tell his wife the good news he sat down in front of her the covered jar which was heavy
2461,2952-407-0007.flac,after having written a farewell letter containing these words when i am dead it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell but to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it great wealth will be given by the ghost of me
2462,2952-407-0024.flac,if by striking upon the wash basin of umegae i could make honourable money come to me
2463,2952-407-0014.flac,you cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy one volumes of the buddhist texts but you can make a revolving library containing them turn round by pushing it like a windlass
2464,2952-407-0001.flac,who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for bell metal but afterwards she much regretted her mirror she remembered things that her mother had told her about it and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her mother but to her mother's mother and grandmother and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected
2465,2952-407-0009.flac,so the ringing became an affliction and the priests could not endure it and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp the swamp was deep and swallowed it up and that was the end of the bell
2466,2952-407-0015.flac,so much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazoraru the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples but for present purposes the following will serve if you should make a little man of straw
2467,2952-407-0027.flac,and they opened it together and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with
2468,2952-407-0020.flac,but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble one of these persons was a woman called umegae
2469,2952-407-0011.flac,the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith
2470,2952-407-0019.flac,after the bell had been rolled into the swamp there was of course no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it
2471,2952-407-0005.flac,evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving she had not presented her offering with all her heart and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to the mirror kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace
2472,2952-407-0017.flac,that would illustrate one signification of nazoraru or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large maxa on each of them
2473,2952-407-0004.flac,a saying mystically expressed by the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody
2474,2952-410-0052.flac,at the mention of that name a murmur of admiration filled the courtroom for there were many present who remembered it and kwairyo immediately found himself among friends instead of judges friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness
2475,2952-410-0035.flac,and there he is behind that tree hiding behind that tree see him the fat coward in the same moment the head of the aruji followed by the other four heads sprang at kwairyo
2476,2952-410-0055.flac,though brave the highwayman was startled he dropped the garment and sprang back then he cried out you
2477,2952-410-0050.flac,perhaps you once belonged to the samurai class
2478,2952-410-0031.flac,to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing
2479,2952-410-0030.flac,presently the head of the aruji stopped eating and said ah that travelling priest who came to night how fat all his body is when we shall have eaten him our bellies will be well filled i was foolish to talk to him as i did
2480,2952-410-0036.flac,but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree and with that tree he struck the heads as they came knocking them from him with tremendous blows four of them fled away but the head of the aruji though battered again and again desperately continued to bound at the priest
2481,2952-410-0053.flac,when kwairyo left suwa he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world as for the head he took it with him jocosely insisting that he intended it for a miyage and now it only remains to tell what became of the head
2482,2952-410-0058.flac,take the thing said kwairyo i was not joking
2483,2952-410-0054.flac,a day or two after leaving suwa kwairyo met with a robber who stopped him in a lonesome place and bade him strip kwairyo at once removed his koromo and offered it to the robber who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve
2484,2952-410-0034.flac,since my body has been moved to rejoin it is not possible then i must die and all through the work of that priest
2485,2952-410-0042.flac,seized the priest and took him to jail for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who in the moment of being killed had caught the murderer's sleeve in his teeth as the kwairyo he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him
2486,2952-410-0038.flac,but its teeth still held the sleeve and for all his great strength kwairyo could not force open the jaws with the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house and there caught sight of the other four rokurokubi squatting together
2487,2952-410-0040.flac,and kwairyo knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all folled with blood and foam and clay and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself
2488,2952-410-0047.flac,the old man turned it round and round carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters he called the attention of his colleagues to these and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon
2489,2952-410-0043.flac,so after having passed a night in prison he was brought before the magistrates of the district then he was ordered to explain how he a priest had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people
2490,2952-410-0033.flac,he has taken the body of our aruji and i do not know where he has put it at this announcement the head of the aruji distinctly visible in the moonlight assumed a frightful aspect its eyes opened monstrously its hair stood up bristling at its teeth gnashed
2491,2952-410-0045.flac,but the magistrates did not laugh they judged him to be a hardened criminal and his story and insult to their intelligence therefore without further questioning they decided to order his immediate execution all of them except one
2492,2952-410-0039.flac,with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies but when they perceived him at the back door all screamed the priest the priest and fled through the other doorway out into the woods eastward the sky was brightening day was about to dawn
2493,2952-410-0046.flac,a very old man this aged officer had made no remark during the trial but after having heard the opinion of his colleagues he rose up and said let us first examine the head carefully for this i think has not yet been done
2494,2952-410-0056.flac,kwairyo answered i shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist but i must tell you that this is not the head of a man it is a goblin's head so if you buy it and have any trouble in consequence please to remember that you were not deceived by me
2495,2952-410-0044.flac,kwairyo laughed long and loudly at these questions and then he said siras i did not fasten the head to my sleeve it fastened itself there much against my will and i have not committed any crime for this is not the head of a man it is the head of a goblin
2496,2952-410-0059.flac,and he then became afraid that the spirit of the rokuro kubi might give him trouble so he made up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had come and to bury it with its body he found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of kai but nobody was there
2497,2952-410-0049.flac,there are the characters you can see for yourselves that they have not been painted moreover it is well known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the province of kai from very ancient time but you sir he exclaimed turning to kwairyo
2498,2952-410-0037.flac,and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe kwairyo however as quickly gripped the head by its topknot and repeatedly struck it it did not release its hold but uttered a long moan and thereafter ceased to struggle it was dead
2499,2952-410-0032.flac,another head the head of a young woman immediately rose up and flitted to the house lightly as a bat after a few minutes it came back and cried out huskily in a tone of great alarm that travelling priest is not in the house he is gone but that is not the worst of the matter
2500,2952-410-0051.flac,before becoming a priest i long followed the profession of arms and in those days i never feared man or devil my name then was isoga he dazaimon taketsura of kyushu there may be some among you who remember it
2501,2952-410-0060.flac,and he could not discover the body therefore he buried the head by itself in the grove behind the cottage and he had a tombstone set up over the grave and he caused a segaki service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the rokuro kubi
2502,2952-410-0057.flac,what a nice priest you are exclaimed the robber you kill men and jest about it but i am really in earnest here is my robe and here is the money and let me have the head what is the use of joking
2503,2952-410-0041.flac,after which he gathered together his few belongings and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey right on he journeyed until he came to suwa
2504,2952-410-0048.flac,on the contrary the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem then said the elder i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth this is the head of a rokurokubi
2505,2952-410-0022.flac,the night was beautiful there was no cloud in the sky there was no wind and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of foliage and glittered on the dews of the garden
2506,2952-410-0010.flac,and i must assure you sir that it is very dangerous to sleep here therefore although my house is only a wretched thatched hut let me beg of you to come home with me at once in the way of food i have nothing to offer you but there is a roof at least and you can sleep under it without risk
2507,2952-410-0008.flac,as for lonesome places i like them they are suitable for meditation i am accustomed to sleeping in the open air and i have learned never to be anxious about my life
2508,2952-410-0013.flac,and they must have been taught by some one well acquainted with the rules of propriety then turning to his host the aruji or housemaster as the others called him kwairyo said
2509,2952-410-0004.flac,he had always welcomed discomfort and even a bare rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow his body was iron and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow
2510,2952-410-0014.flac,from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household i imagine that you have not always been a wood cutter perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes smiling the woodcutter answered sir you are not mistaken
2511,2952-410-0021.flac,then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sutras by the light of a paper lantern until a late hour he continued to read and pray
2512,2952-410-0012.flac,slippery roots for the foot to rest upon sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock but at last kwairyo found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead and he saw before him a small thatched cottage
2513,2952-410-0002.flac,as in other years he had laughed at peril so now also he scorned danger
2514,2952-410-0027.flac,and presently die now if these be rokuro kubi they mean me no good so i shall be justified in following the instructions of the book he seized the body of the aruji by the feet pulled it to the window and pushed it out
2515,2952-410-0026.flac,and remove the body to another place the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck and the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved it will strike itself upon the floor three times bouncing like a ball and will pant as in great fear

2640,2691-156745-0041.flac,and some in their eagerness forgot to roll down their sleeves before they began to talk one triumphantly repeated to each newcomer the motherly advice which she gave the young couple when she first
2641,2691-156745-0003.flac,i would rush off alone among the wild flowers to get away from the torturing sympathy even there i met those who would look at me with great serious eyes shake their heads and mournfully say you poor little mite
2642,2691-156745-0033.flac,when we did not find our sisters and aimlessly followed others to the little shop where a friendly appearing elderly man was cutting slices of meat and handing them to customers
2643,2691-156745-0006.flac,intense excitement and indignation prevailed at the fort after captain fallon and other members of his party gave their account of the condition found at the mountain camps and of interviews had with keseberg whom they now called cannibal
2644,2691-156745-0030.flac,she tossed the bundle from her head sprang into the water snatched francis as she rose to the surface and restored her to us without a word before we had recovered sufficiently to speak she was gone
2645,2691-156745-0025.flac,was where night overtook us often we trudged to the rancheriya beyond the pond made by the adobe moulders who had built the houses and walls surrounding the fort there the indian mothers were good to us

2648,2691-156745-0000.flac,orphans keseberg and his accusers sensational accounts of the tragedy at donner lake property sold and guardian appointed kindly indians grandpa
2649,2691-156745-0015.flac,and blood curdling editorials increased public sentiment against keseberg stamping him with e mark of cain and closing the door of every home against him
2650,2691-156745-0043.flac,and how finally he himself had carried to the bereaved daughter the last accounts from donner camp
2651,8609-283227-0041.flac,i want if you will allow me to show you the principle upon which he acted with regard to church rates certainly i beg your pardon for interrupting you the pharisees demanded a tribute which it is allowed was for the support of the temple and its worship
2652,8609-283227-0054.flac,as i hope you will allow in some imperfect measure god is worshipped and the truth is preached in it most willingly would i pay the money i object simply because the rate is compulsory and therein you have our lord's example to the contrary
2653,8609-283227-0067.flac,and cost him nothing i need not say he never became a churchman or that i never expected he would all his memories of a religious childhood all the sources of the influences which had refined and elevated him were surrounded with other associations
2654,8609-283227-0042.flac,our lord did not refuse to acknowledge their authority notwithstanding the many ways in which they had degraded the religious observances of the jewish church he acknowledged himself a child of the church but said that as a child he ought to have been left to contribute as he pleased
2655,8609-283227-0038.flac,my dear sir i do not like writing letters especially on subjects of importance there are thousand chances of misunderstanding whereas in a personal interview there is a possibility of controversy being hallowed by communion
2656,8609-283227-0025.flac,i stretched out my hand but the broker was before me without another word he pocketed the money jumped into his cart with his man and drove off leaving the churchwarden and the parson standing at the door of the dissenting minister with his mahogany table on the path between them now mister brownrigg i said
2657,8609-283227-0066.flac,and many a time ere his death we consulted together about things that befel once he came to me about a legal difficulty in connection with the deed of trust of his chapel and although i could not help him myself i directed him to such help as was thorough
2658,8609-283227-0063.flac,i only say that in separating from us you are in effect and by your conduct saying to us do not preach for you follow not with us i will not be guilty of the same towards you your fathers did the church no end of good by leaving it
2659,8609-283227-0047.flac,may i hope that you will do me the credit to believe that if i saw clearly that they were the same thing i would not hesitate a moment to follow our lord's example i believe it perfectly therefore however we may defer we are in reality at no strife
2660,8609-283227-0057.flac,i am relieved to speak my mind knowing he would have us speak our minds to each other but i do not want to proselatize if you change your mind you will probably do so on different grounds from any i give you
2661,8609-283227-0010.flac,but of extreme vews as i heard upon insignificant points and moved by a great dislike to national churches and episcopacy this i say is what i had made out about him from what i had heard
2662,8609-283227-0039.flac,to missus templeton for not inviting her with you
2663,8609-283227-0002.flac,i had so far recovered that i was able to rise about noon and go into my study though i was very weak and had not yet been out when one morning missus pearson came into the room and said please sir
2664,8609-283227-0023.flac,before such a thing should have happened i feel so disgraced i am ashamed to look mister templeton in the face carry the table into the house again directly it's my property now interposed the broker ive bought it of the churchwarden and paid for it
2665,8609-283227-0036.flac,the gist of the letter lay in these words i confess it perplexes me to understand how to reconcile your christian and friendly behaviour to one who most of your brethren would consider as much beneath their notice as inferior to them in social position
2666,8609-283227-0064.flac,but it is time to unite now once more followed a silence if people could only meet and look each other in the face said mister templeton at length they might find there was not such a gulf between them as they had fancied and so we parted
2667,8609-283227-0051.flac,i will yield the point when you can show me the same ground for believing the church of england the national church appointed such by god that i can show you and you know already for receiving the jewish church as the appointment of god
2668,8609-283227-0045.flac,or what came to the same thing make a servant of his father namely a fish in the sea of galilee
2669,8609-283227-0018.flac,which stood at the door breathless with haste i was yet able to call out put that table down directly at the same moment mister brownrigg appeared from within the door
2670,8609-283227-0069.flac,i am sure that his feelings were moderated even changed towards her and though this may seem of no consequence to one who loves the church more than the brotherhood it does not seem of little consequence to me who loves the church because of the brotherhood of which it is the type and the restorer
2671,8609-283227-0001.flac,been said about the election of a colleague so little seemed to fall to the duty of the churchwarden that i regarded the neglect as a trifle and was remisse in setting it right i had therefore to suffer as was just indeed mister brownrigg was not the man to have power in his hands unchecked
2672,8609-283227-0005.flac,to my churchwarden we must call a vestry before long and have this look to now my predecessor had left everything of the kind to his churchwardens and the inhabitants from their side had likewise left the whole affair to the churchwardens but mister brownrigg
2673,8609-283227-0070.flac,it was long before another church rate was levied in marshmellows and when the circumstance did take place no one dreamed of calling on mister templeton for his share in it but having heard of it he called himself upon the churchwarden mister brownrigg still and offered the money cheerfully
2674,8609-283227-0003.flac,confident there must be a good reason for it and so told missus pearson to show him in oh sir i know you would be vexed if you hadn't been told he exclaimed and i am sure you will not be angry with me for troubling you what is the matter tom i said
2675,8609-283227-0017.flac,but such was the commotion in my mind that i had become quite unconscious of illness or even feebleness hurrying on in more terror than i can well express lest i should be too late i reached mister templeton's house just as a small mahogany table was being hoisted into a spring cart
2676,8609-283227-0011.flac,and my reader will very probably be inclined to ask but why with principles such as yours should you have only heresay to go upon why did you not make the honest man's acquaintance in such a small place men should not keep each other at arm's length
2677,8609-283227-0061.flac,are there not countless modes of saying the truth you have some of them i hope i have some
2678,8609-283227-0022.flac,his face had lengthened considerably by this time and its rubicunt hue declined i did not think you would stand upon ceremony about it sir
2679,8609-283227-0007.flac,he did during my illness with the notion of pleasing me by the discovery that the repairs had been already effected according to my mind nor did any one of my congregation throw the least difficulty in the churchwarden's way and now i must refer to another circumstance in the history of my parish
2680,8609-283227-0026.flac,lend me a hand to carry this table in again he yielded not graciously that could not be expected but in silence oh sir interposed young tom who had stood by during the dispute let me take it you're not able to lift it
2681,8609-283227-0048.flac,but is there not this difference that our lord was as you say a child of the jewish church which was induitably established by god now if i cannot conscientiously belong to the so called english church why should i have to pay church rate or tribute
2682,8609-283227-0055.flac,a silence followed for i had to deal with an honest man who was thinking i resumed a thousand difficulties will no doubt come up to be considered in the matter do not suppose i am anxious to convince you i believe that our father our elder brother
2683,8609-283227-0033.flac,mister brownrigg i spoke in heat when i came up to you and i am sure i did you wrong i am certain you had no improper motive in not making me acquainted with your proceedings you meant no harm to me but you did very wrong towards mister templeton i will try to show you that when i am well again
2684,8609-283227-0046.flac,it is wrong to compel and wrong to refuse the payment of a church rate i do not say equally wrong it is much worse to compel than to refuse you are very generous returned mister templeton
2685,8609-283227-0059.flac,don't you regard me as an interloper now one who has no right to speak because he does not belong to the church god forbid i answered if a word of mine would make you leave my parish to morrow i dare not say it
2686,8609-283227-0030.flac,glancing first at the table then at me and then at mister brownrigg as if begging someone to tell him what to say but i did not leave him a moment in this perplexity mister templeton i said quitting the table and holding out my hand
2687,8609-283227-0068.flac,than those of the church and her forms the church was his grandmother not his mother and he had not made any acquaintance with her till comparatively late in life but while i do not say that his intellectual objections to the church were less strong than they had been
2688,8609-283227-0027.flac,and so mister brownrigg and i blundered into the little parlour with our burden not a great one
2689,8609-283227-0031.flac,that you should have been annoyed like this i have mister templeton interrupted me i assure you it was a matter of conscience with me he said on no other ground i know it i know it i said interrupting him in my turn
2690,8609-283227-0037.flac,with your remaining the minister of a church in which such enormities as you employed your private influence to counteract in my case are not only possible but certainly lawful and recognized by most of its members as likewise expedient to this i replied
2691,8609-283227-0020.flac,now i said carry it back into the house why sir interposed mister brownrigg it's all right yes i said as right as the devil would have it
2692,8609-283227-0012.flac,and any reader who says so will say right all i have to suggest for myself is simply a certain shyness for which i cannot entirely account but which was partly made up of fear to intrude or of being supposed to arrogate to myself the right of making advances
2693,8609-283227-0019.flac,i think he had not heard me you see i'm prompt mister walton he said but bless my soul how ill you look without answering him for i was more angry with him than i ought to have been i repeated put that table down i tell you they did so
2694,8609-283227-0058.flac,and i haven't been to a university like you but i'm no fool either i hope don't be offended at my question wouldn't you be glad to see me out of your parish now i began to speak but he went on
2695,8609-283227-0021.flac,i'm not so sure of that i believe i had the right to be chairman at the vestry meaning but instead of even letting me know you took advantage of my illness to hurry on matters to this shameful and wicked excess i did the poor man wrong in this for i believe he had hurried things really to please me
2696,8609-283227-0049.flac,shall i tell you the argument the english church might then use the church might say then you are a stranger and no child therefore like the kings of the earth we may take tribute of you so you see it would come to this that dissenters alone should be compelled to pay church rates
2697,8609-283227-0004.flac,which were necessary and must be done before another winter i confess i was rather pleased for i wanted my people to feel that the church was their property and that it was their privilege if they could regard it as a blessing to have the church to keep it in decent order and repair
2698,8609-283227-0040.flac,how you could belong to a church with authorizes things of which you yourself so heartily disapprove and i answer you i returned that just to such a church our lord belonged i do not quite understand you our lord belong to the jewish church
2699,8609-283227-0056.flac,and the spirit that proceedeth from them is teaching you as i believe i too am being taught by the same why then should i be anxious to convince you of anything will you not in his good time come to see what he would have you see
2700,8609-283227-0015.flac,had on this very day been visited by the churchwarden accompanied by a broker from the neighbouring town of adishead and at the very time when i was hearing of the fact was suffering distraint of his goods the porcen head of the churchwarden was not on his shoulders by accident nor without significance
2701,8609-283227-0043.flac,to the support of its ordinances and not to be compelled after such a fashion there i have you exclaimed mister templeton
2702,8609-283227-0024.flac,but i tell you the whole affair is illegal and if you carry away the table i shall see what the law will do for me i assure you i will prosecute you myself you take up that money or i will it will go to pay counsel i give you my word if you do not take it to quench strife
2703,8609-283227-0014.flac,mister templeton then had refused as a point of conscience to pay the church rate when the collector went round to demand it had been summoned before a magistrate in consequence had suffered a default and proceedings being pushed from the first in all the pride of mister brownrigg's legality
2704,8609-283227-0009.flac,amongst whom were the families of two or three farmers of substance while the village and its neighbourhood contributed a portion of the poorest of their inhabitants a year or two before i came their minister died and they had chosen another a very worthy man of considerable erudition
2705,8609-283227-0065.flac,now i do not write all this for the sake of the church rate question i write it to commemorate the spirit in which mister templeton met me for it is of consequence that two men who love their master should recognize each that the other does so and thereupon if not before
2706,8609-283227-0034.flac,but but you mustn't talk more now said doctor duncan so i shook hands with mister brownrigg and we parted i fear from what i know of my churchwarden that he went home with the conviction that he had done perfectly right
2707,8609-283227-0006.flac,who i must say had taken more pains than might have been expected of him to make himself acquainted with the legalities of his office did not fail to call a vestry to which as usual no one had responded whereupon he imposed a rate according to his own unaided judgment this i believe
2708,8609-283227-0060.flac,i do not want to incur the rebuke of our lord for surely the words forbid him not involved some rebuke would it not be a fearful thing that one soul because if a deed of mine should receive a less portion of elevation or comfort in his journey towards his home
2709,8609-283227-0035.flac,and amongst them by mister templeton and here i may as well sketch the result of that strange introduction to the dissenting minister
2710,8609-283227-0053.flac,having received from it a thousand influences for good if in no other way yet through your fathers to find it no great hardship and not very unreasonable to pay a trifle to keep in repair one of the tabernacles in which our forefathers worshipped together
2711,8609-283227-0008.flac,there was a little chapel down a lane leading from the main street of the village in which there was service three times every sunday
2712,8609-283227-0062.flac,who will not hear me preach to them in the name and love of god mister templeton speak that you do know and testify that you have seen you and i will help each other in proportion as we serve the master
2713,8609-283227-0050.flac,we both laughed at this pushing of the argument to illegitimate conclusions then i resumed but the real argument is that not for such faults should we separate from each other not for such faults or any faults so long as it is the repository of the truth should you separate from the church
2714,8609-283227-0029.flac,but when we entered he rose he was a man of middle size about forty with short black hair and overhanging bushy eyebrows his mouth indicated great firmness not unmingled with sweetness and even with humour he smiled as he rose but looked embarrassed
2715,8609-283227-0016.flac,but i did not wait to understand all this now it was enough for me that tom bore witness to the fact that at that moment proceedings were thus driven to extremity i rang the bell for my boots and to the open mouthed dismay of missus pearson left the vicarage leaning on tom's arm
2716,8609-283227-0032.flac,i beg your pardon and i have done my best to make amends for it offences must come you know mister templeton but i trust i have not incurred the woe that follows upon them by means of whom they come for i knew nothing of it and indeed was too ill
2717,8609-283227-0013.flac,partly of a dread lest we should not be able to get on together and so the attempt should result in something unpleasantly awkward i dare say likewise that the natural shelliness of the english had something to do with it at all events i had not made his acquaintance
2718,8609-283227-0044.flac,i grant it it is entirely wrong a very unchristian proceeding but our lord did not therefore desert the church as you would have me do he paid the money lest he should offend and not having it of his own he had to ask his father for it
2719,8609-283227-0052.flac,that would involve a long argument upon which though i have little doubt upon the matter myself i cannot say i am prepared to enter at this moment meantime i would just ask you whether you are not sufficiently a child of the church of england
2720,8609-283227-0000.flac,he and another farmer his neighbour had been so often re elected churchwardens that at last they seemed to have gained a prescriptive right to the office and the form of election fell into disuse
2721,8609-283227-0028.flac,mister templeton sat in a windsor chair in the middle of the room evidently the table had been carried away from before him leaving his position uncovered the floor was strewed with the books which had laidn upon it he sat reading an old folio as if nothing had happened
2722,8609-262281-0017.flac,are you going to the meeting this afternoon of course not said constance my time now belongs to you but i think mamma wishes you to go with us she said something about it does she i should very much like to go
2723,8609-262281-0020.flac,not very early answered constance hitherto i have risen at seven summer and winter dressing and reading take me just an hour for the other hour i find plenty of occupation we do not breakfast until nine on account of tom and charley i shall rise at six now
2724,8609-262281-0026.flac,but then good resolutions were forgotten and idleness followed not only idleness temper also
2725,8609-262281-0002.flac,preparing their lessons fanny came running in her hair an curl papers some bread and butter in her hand carrey has not finished her breakfast miss channing quoth she she was lazy this morning i think some one else was lazy also said constance gently drawing the child to her
2726,8609-262281-0010.flac,i was in such a passion constance wondered where she should begin there was so much to do so much to alter in so many ways to set to work abruptly would never answer it must be commenced gradually almost imperceptibly little by little caroline
2727,8609-262281-0005.flac,be so kind as to take the papers out of miss fanny's hair and let it be done in the future martha before she comes to me gently as the words were spoken there was no mistaking that the tone was one of authority and not to be trifled with
2728,8609-262281-0022.flac,not at all answered lady augusta i never chaperone two children to a crowded meeting people might say they took up the room of grown up persons you will let me go not caroline miss channing pleaded fanny with her mother
2729,8609-262281-0030.flac,if that anticipated living would fall in which seems very far away in the clouds and you were wholly mine we might have caroline with us for a time laughed mister yorke constance laughed too do not be impatient
2730,8609-262281-0016.flac,caroline burst into tears i should do better if mamma were not so cross with me miss channing i always do anything that william yorke asks me and i will do anything for you constance kissed her then will you begin by rising early and being ready for me at seven
2731,8609-262281-0014.flac,annabel is fond of talking nonsense but she is a good loving child at heart
2732,8609-262281-0018.flac,lady augusta came in and proffered the invitation to constance to accompany them constance then spoke of giving the children the extra two hours from seven to nine it was really necessary she said if she was to do her duty by them
2733,8609-262281-0003.flac,why did you come down half dressed my dear i am quite dressed responded fanny my frocks on and so is my pinafore and these said constance touching the curl papers oh martha got up late and said she had no time to take them out
2734,8609-262281-0037.flac,think of all that is at stake renewed health exertion happiness arthur
2735,8609-262281-0031.flac,or it will seem to be further off still it will come william they had been speaking in an undertone standing together at a window apart from the rest mister channing was lying on his sofa underneath the other window and now spoke to mister yorke
2736,8609-262281-0033.flac,i have heard so his complaint was rheumatism very much as i fancy the same sort of rheumatism that afflicts you he told me he came to europe with very little hope he feared his complaint had become chronic and incurable
2737,8609-262281-0012.flac,would you undertake to get up and be ready for me asked constance caroline drew a long face she did not speak my dear you are fifteen well responded caroline
2738,8609-262281-0039.flac,doctor lamb said the cost was so trifling as scarcely to be credited continued mister yorke in a tone of remonstrance arthur don't you care to help to save him i would move heaven and earth to save my father impulsively spoke arthur
2739,8609-262281-0001.flac,constance would willingly have commenced the daily routine at an earlier hour lady augusta freely confess that to come earlier would be useless for she could not get her daughters up strictly speaking lady augusta did not personally try to get them up
2740,8609-262281-0034.flac,but he has been restored in a wonderful manner and is in sound health again and what remedies did he use eagerly asked mister channing a three months residence at some medicinal springs in germany nothing else when i say nothing else of course i must imply that he was under medical treatment there
2741,8609-262281-0036.flac,the channings themselves were silent they could not see the way at all clear when mister yorke was leaving he beckoned constance and arthur into the hall
2742,8609-262281-0041.flac,did you think i was lost i was seduced into joining your missionary meeting people and have had to stop late at the office to make up for it
2743,8609-262281-0008.flac,it is not for that i wish to go said caroline i think meetings where there's nothing but talk or the dullest thing in the world if i were to listen it would send me to sleep then why do you wish so much to attend this one because i shall wear my new dress
2744,8609-262281-0000.flac,chapter sixteen much to alter at the same moment constance channing was traversing the boundaries on her way to lady augusta yorke's where she had some days since commenced her duties it took her scarcely two minutes to get there for the houses were almost within view of each other
2745,8609-262281-0042.flac,fresh hope seems to arise daily that those german baths would restore him to health they cured doctor lamb i say hamish that the money must be found for it somehow added mister yorke found of course it shall be found cried gay hamish
2746,8609-262281-0023.flac,no said caroline sharply miss channing will fix upon me i shall obey lady augusta
2747,8609-262281-0015.flac,i have so much to teach you caroline to your mind and heart as well as to your intellect that i feel the hours is at present arranged will be insufficient for me my dear when you grow up to womanhood i am sure you will wish to be loving and loved
2748,8609-262281-0025.flac,you must not be disappointed if in that case i give the privilege to caroline as being the elder of the two but i will make it up to you in some other way alas for poor caroline's resolution for a short time an hour or so she did strive to do her best
2749,8609-262281-0028.flac,which she had not learnt in the day how shall you get on with them constance the reverend william yorke inquired of her that same evening have the weeds destroyed the good seed not quite destroyed it replied constance though she sighed sadly as she spoke
2750,8609-262281-0032.flac,replied mister channing i think it is possible that his experience in another line may be of service to you continued mister yorke
2751,8609-262281-0035.flac,it is the very thing you see sir that has been ordered for you ay sighed mister channing feeling how very faint appeared to be the hope that he should have the opportunity of trying it i was mentioning your case to him observed mister yorke
2752,8609-262281-0027.flac,she even forgot herself so far as to be insolent fanny was taken to the meeting you saw her in the carriage when lady augusta drove to mister galloway's office and persuaded hamish to join them caroline was left at home in a state of open rebellion with the lessons to learn
2753,8609-262281-0024.flac,it will be only right to do so suppose we are both good and merited equally suggested fanny
2754,8609-262281-0013.flac,deficient in many ways caroline in goodness in thoughtfulness and in other desirable qualities and greatly so in education annabel who is a year younger than you is twice as advanced annabel says you worry her into learning
2755,8609-262281-0006.flac,martha withdrew with the child and just then caroline came in full of eagerness miss channing mamma says she shall take one of us to the missionary meeting whichever you choose to fix upon mind you fix upon me
2756,8609-262281-0009.flac,i have not had it on yet
2757,8609-262281-0021.flac,and come here at seven very well said lady augusta i suppose this will only apply to the summer months one of the girls shall go with us to day whichever deserves it best you are not leaving one of them at home to make room for me i hope lady augusta
2758,8609-262281-0019.flac,you will never put up with our scrambling breakfast miss channing the boys are so unruly and i do not get up to it half my time
2759,8609-262281-0011.flac,in what way miss channing did i not request you to have that exercise written out i know said caroline with some contrition i intended to write it out this morning before you came but somehow i lay in bed
2760,8609-262281-0029.flac,there is so much ill to undo caroline is the worst the weeds with her have had long time to get ahead i think perhaps if i could keep her wholly with me for a twelvemonth or so watching over her constantly a great deal might be effected
2761,8609-262281-0004.flac,constance rang the bell martha who was the only maid kept except the cook appeared in answer to it lady augusta was wont to say that she had too much expense with her boys to keep many servants and the argument was a true one
2762,8609-262281-0043.flac,i intend to be a chief contributor to it myself but his joking words an careless manner jarred at that moment upon the spirit both of arthur and constance channing why
2763,8609-262281-0038.flac,arthur did not feel hopeful indeed his heart sank within him the whole time that they were talking hamish and his difficulties were the dark shadow though he could not tell this to mister yorke were mister channing to go abroad and the arrest of hamish to follow upon it
2764,8609-262281-0007.flac,some of the anecdotes are beautiful who told you they were asked caroline mister yorke replied constance a pretty blush rising to her cheek he knows the lecturer well you would be pleased to hear them
2765,8609-262281-0040.flac,stung by the implied reproof i should not care what labour it cost me to procure the money so that i succeeded we all would said constance you must know we would william from hamish downwards
2766,7402-59171-0022.flac,by a hurried alteration of atmosphere in this manner comedy as well as tragedy must create some kind of illusion and the destruction of the illusion even for the sake of a joke may mean the destruction of laughter
2767,7402-59171-0042.flac,because it is from an orthodox point of view geniality in the wrong place it is like a grin in church a laugh at a marriage service
2768,7402-59171-0014.flac,he sees men and women too frequently in the refracting shallows of theories he is a doctrinaire and his characters are often comic statements of his doctrines rather than the reflections of men and women
2769,7402-59171-0023.flac,the proportion of unreality is not overwhelming it has been enormously exaggerated after all if the character of the newspaper man and the doctor's dilemma is machine made
2770,7402-59171-0005.flac,seems like life in ruins are filled at times with a wild lust to denounce and belittle him he has been called more names than any other man of letters alive
2771,7402-59171-0048.flac,it may be said of mister shaw that in his politics as in his plays he has sought utopia along the path of disillusion as other men have sought it along the path of idealism
2772,7402-59171-0006.flac,when all the other names have been exhausted and we are about to become inarticulate we even denounce him as a bore but this is only the billings gate of our exasperation mister shaw is not a bore
2773,7402-59171-0021.flac,because into an atmosphere of more or less naturalistic comedy they simply introduce a farcical exaggeration of mister shaw's opinion of the incompetence and impudence of journalists mister shaw's comedies are repeatedly injured
2774,7402-59171-0046.flac,a great number of people thought he must be a pro german the fact is in war time more than at any other time people dread the vision of the saturist and the sceptic
2775,7402-59171-0018.flac,admirably true both to human nature and to mister shaw's view of the human nature of artist but when he goes on with his last breath to utter his artistic creed i believe in michael angelo vilaskes and rembrandt in the might of design
2776,7402-59171-0019.flac,the redemption of all things by beauty everlasting and the message of art that has made these hands blesed amen amen these sentences are no more natural or naturalistic
2777,7402-59171-0030.flac,a few only of these latter types are given us by moliere
2778,7402-59171-0034.flac,is an offering at a shrine the true things it contains however make it worth reading
2779,7402-59171-0025.flac,it is much more necessary that we should recognize that amid all his falsifications doctrinal and jocular he has a genuine comic sense of character most french critics
2780,7402-59171-0045.flac,though his attitude to the war was as anti prussian
2781,7402-59171-0047.flac,this is not to disparage mister shaw's contributions to the discussion of politics that contribution has been brilliant challenging and humane and not more wayward than the contribution of the partisan
2782,7402-59171-0007.flac,whatever else he may be he has succeeded in the mere business of interesting us beyond any other writer of his time
2783,7402-59171-0035.flac,for instance what many critics have failed to see that in his dramatic work mister shaw is less a wit than a humorist in shaw's work we find few studied jests few epigrams even
2784,7402-59171-0012.flac,he is in the line of all those tramps and stage irishmen who have gone through life with so fine a swagger of words this only means that in his life he is an artist
2785,7402-59171-0029.flac,molier depicts the miser the jealousman the missenthrope the hypocrite where a shaw depicts the bourgeois the rebel the capitalist the workman the socialist the doctor
2786,7402-59171-0040.flac,he has done this sometimes with all the exuberance of mirth sometimes with all the bitterness of a saturist even his bitterness is never venomous however he is genial beyond the majority of inveterate controversialist and propagandist
2787,7402-59171-0002.flac,he has gone about like a pickpocket of illusions from the world of literature to the world of morals and from the world of morals to the world of politics and everywhere he has gone an innumerable growl has followed him
2788,7402-59171-0017.flac,rather when he is presenting a queer fizzing mixture of human nature and his opinions about it this may be sometimes actually a virtue in his comedy certainly from the time of aristophanes onwards
2789,7402-59171-0004.flac,because he has always been able to laugh at his disciples as unfeelingly as at anybody else he has courted unpopularity as other men have courted popularity he has refused to assume the vacuous countenance either of an idol
2790,7402-59171-0032.flac,is intended as a biography and general criticism of mister shaw as well as a comparison between his work and molieres it contains it must be confessed a great deal that is not new to english readers
2791,7402-59171-0036.flac,moliere anticipated mister shaw in outraging the sentiment for instance which has gathered round the family moliere and shaw as he puts it with quaint seriousness appear to be unaware of what a father is what a father is worth
2792,7402-59171-0038.flac,is his own he has studied with his own eyes the swollen bellied pretences of preachers and poets and rich men and lovers and politicians and he has derided them as they have never been derided on the english stage before
2793,7402-59171-0016.flac,one is bound to contradict him mister shaw often thinks he is presenting true human nature when he is merely presenting his opinions about human nature the human nature of soldiers of artists of women or
2794,7402-59171-0003.flac,not that he has not had his disciples men and women who believe that what mister shaw says on any conceivable subject is far more important than what the times or the manchester guardian says he has never found the church however
2795,7402-59171-0000.flac,mister shaw came for a short time recently to be regarded less as an author than as an incident in the european war in the opinion of many people it seemed as if the allies were fighting against a combination composed of germany
2796,7402-59171-0015.flac,he observes in one of the many passages in which he justifies himself the audience thinks it is being made fun of in reality i am simply a very careful writer of natural history
2797,7402-59171-0043.flac,that he was not intensely serious in all that he wrote about the war but his seriousness is essentially the seriousness of in the higher sense of the word the comic artist of the disillusionist
2798,7402-59171-0008.flac,probably he was doomed to be a figure just as doctor johnson was if he had not told us legends about himself
2799,7402-59171-0013.flac,until we realize that he is an artist not only in the invention of his own life but in the observation of the lives of other people his broad bent is as wonderful a figure as his george bernard shaw not that his portraiture is always faithful
2800,7402-59171-0027.flac,moliere has never drawn a doctor more comically the doctor than paramor nor more characteristic figures of women than those in the same play the philanderer the character drawing is admirable
2801,7402-59171-0011.flac,my business would immediately begin to fall off you blame me for having declared myself to be the most remarkable man of my time but the claim is an arguable one why should i not say it when i believe that it is true
2802,7402-59171-0039.flac,he has dirided them with both an artistic and a moral energy he has brought them all into a palace of truth where they have revealed themselves with an unaccustomed and startling frankness
2803,7402-59171-0009.flac,in search of a ghost with its beard on fire his critics often accuse him in regard to the invention of the shaw myth of having designed a poster rather than painted a portrait
2804,7402-59171-0001.flac,and he does express an opinion on everything without making a multitude of people shake their fists in impotent anger his life at least his public life
2805,7402-59171-0028.flac,and the characterization in moliere in shaw's plays the characters are less representative of vices or passions than those of moliere and more representative of class profession or sect
2806,7402-59171-0044.flac,he sees current history from the absolutely opposite point of view say to the lyric poet
2807,7402-59171-0031.flac,of farce and so forth is a suggestive contribution to criticism i am not sure that the comparison would not have been more effectively put in a chapter than a book
2808,7402-59171-0033.flac,mister shaw is made an idol in spite of himself
2809,7402-59171-0020.flac,without any admixture of humanity repeating mister shaw's opinion of the nature of the creed of artist there is a similar falsification in the same play in the characterization of the newspaper man who is present at dubidat's death
2810,7402-59171-0026.flac,declare that bernard shaw does depict characters
2811,7402-59171-0024.flac,the much more important character of bby the soothing and incompetent doctor is a creation of the true comic genius nine people out of ten harp on mister shaw's errors
2812,7402-59171-0041.flac,he does not hesitate to wound and he does not hesitate to misunderstand but he is free from malice the geniality of his comedy on the other hand is often more offensive than malice
2813,7402-59171-0037.flac,the defense of mister shaw however does not depend on any real or imaginary resemblance of his plays to moliers his joy and his misery before the ludicrous spectacle of human life are his own and his expression of them
2814,7402-59171-0010.flac,stop advertising myself on the contrary i must do it more than ever look at pear soap there is a solid house if you like but every wall is still plastered with their advertisements if i were to give up advertising
2815,7402-90848-0009.flac,good bye bobo cried the assembled courtiers who were almost beside themselves with laughter at the simpleton and his errand don't fail to bring back the lost half hour so bobo rode over the hills and far away
2816,7402-90848-0013.flac,answer me you silly have you seen a lost temper anywhere it's about the size of a large melon and has sharp little points on bobo's answering no this dreadful person uttered so perfectly awful a screech of rage
2817,7402-90848-0014.flac,that bobo's horse took fright and ran away with him and it was all that bobo could do to rain him in three miles farther down the road still farther along bobo came to ziz the capital city of the kingdom of the seven brooks and was taken before the king himself
2818,7402-90848-0010.flac,it was very dignified and wore tortoise shell glasses but bobo had to answer no and the old man wandered on again another day the simpleton encountered a tall dark fierce kind of fellow
2819,7402-90848-0012.flac,i'm looking for something i lost myself i've lost my temper
2820,7402-90848-0000.flac,once upon a time there was an old widow woman who had three sons the first two were clever enough but the third bobo by name was little better than a silly simpleton all his mother's scoldings and beatings
2821,7402-90848-0048.flac,on the steps of one of the cottages sat an old woman all alone and weeping with all her might what is the matter my good woman said the king
2822,7402-90848-0040.flac,as for the missing daughter she is the kitchen maid in princess zenza's palace who is known as tilda so bobo thanked father time and at noon
2823,7402-90848-0045.flac,in a word the greatest nobleman in all fairyland
2824,7402-90848-0042.flac,when they got to the seashore the white horse hesitated not an instant but set foot upon the water which bore him up as if it had been not water but earth itself
2825,7402-90848-0029.flac,a youth mounted on a splendid black horse dashed at lighting speed out of the castle and disappeared in the wood an old man with a white beard accompanied by eleven young men whom bobo judged from their expressions to be brothers
2826,7402-90848-0016.flac,and he continued his way on foot three long years passed and bobo grew into a handsome lad but remained a simpleton still finally after he had wandered all about fairyland he came to the edge of the sea
2827,7402-90848-0030.flac,stood by the gate to see the horseman ride away plucking up courage bobo came forward fell on his knee before the old man and told his story truly you should thank the storm fairies said the old man
2828,7402-90848-0005.flac,instead of laughing little tilda would find him a glass of warm milk hang his coat by the fire to dry and tell him not to be such a simpleton again thus after a while
2829,7402-90848-0038.flac,and when bobo had drunk it he was no longer a simpleton and being no longer a simpleton he remembered the man who had lost his reputation the man who had lost his temper and the king whose daughter had been stolen by the fairies
2830,7402-90848-0044.flac,the joy of the monarch knew no bounds and bobo the one time simpleton became on the spot lord bobo of the sapphire hills marquis of the mountains of the moon prince of the valley of golden apples
2831,7402-90848-0004.flac,everybody except little tilda the kitchen maid when poor bobo used to return from some wild goose chase tired out mud stained and often enough wet to the skin
2832,7402-90848-0062.flac,when the rejoicings were over
2833,7402-90848-0023.flac,so bobo sat down on a stone by the foot of the tree and put on the wooden shoes which fitted him very nicely now these shoes were magic shoes and bobo had hardly stepped into them before they turned his feet inland
2834,7402-90848-0060.flac,for the dragon had blown up the lost temper had finished him only one fragment of him a tiny bit of a claw was ever found
2835,7402-90848-0032.flac,they ride for an hour round the whole wide world seven o'clock has just ridden forth yes you shall have the lost half hour but you must look after my son's horses for the space of a whole year to this
2836,7402-90848-0007.flac,shall we send bobo in search of the lost half hour said the princess to the courtiers yes yes cried the courtiers bobo shall look for the lost half hour i'll give him a horse said one
2837,7402-90848-0034.flac,he took such good care of the great black horses of the hours of the night and the white horses of the hours of the day that they were never more proud and strong nor their coats smoother and more gleaming when the year was up bobo again sought out father time
2838,7402-90848-0053.flac,and so it proved in spite of his mad dash bobo who had spurred on ahead arrived exactly half an hour late the monstrous dragon with tilda in his claws
2839,7402-90848-0006.flac,one pleasant midsummer morning when bobo had been nearly a year at the castle princess zenza overslept half an hour and did not come down to breakfast at the usual time when she did get up she found her court waiting for her in the castle gardens
2840,7402-90848-0031.flac,for had you not been wrecked upon this island never would you have discovered the lost half hour i am father time himself and these are my twelve sons the hours every day one after the other
2841,7402-90848-0052.flac,quick quick cried the king and bobo in the same breath let us hurry to the castle we may save her yet but they knew in their hearts that they were too late and that poor tilda had given herself to the dragon
2842,7402-90848-0049.flac,evil days have fallen upon our unhappy kingdom three days ago a terrible dragon alighted in the gardens of the palace and sent word to princess zenza that if within three days she did not provide him with someone brave enough to go home with him and cook his meals
2843,7402-90848-0019.flac,and was wrecked upon a mysterious island of rocks that shone in the night like wet matches a great wave swept the decks and bobo was borne away from his companions and carried toward the shining land
2844,7402-90848-0061.flac,the grand cross of the order of the black cat was conferred upon bobo by princess zenza who also asked his pardon for having treated him so shabbily this bobo gave readily
2845,7402-90848-0015.flac,here the poor old king took out a great green handkerchief and wiped his eyes she was stolen by the fairies on midsummer eve fifteen years ago find her worthy bobo and an immense reward will be yours
2846,7402-90848-0003.flac,now he would be sent to find a white craws feather or a spray of yellow blue bells now he was ordered to look for a square wheel or a glass of dry water everybody laughed at him and made fun of him that is
2847,7402-90848-0055.flac,as for the sun itself turning round like a cart wheel and hissing like ten thousand rockets it rolled back along the sky to the east the hands of the clocks which marked half past two wored back to two o'clock in a twinkling
2848,7402-90848-0058.flac,angered by the sight of bobo and his drawn sword he roared angrily but continued to approach bobo struck at him with his sword the blade broke upon his steely scales the dragon roared again now
2849,7402-90848-0051.flac,that we are mourning at two o'clock she is to be carried off by the dragon it is almost two now alas alas hardly were the words out of her mouth when the town bell struck twice solemnly and sadly
2850,7402-90848-0050.flac,and keep his cavern tidy he would burn our fields with his fiery breath yet who i ask you would be housekeeper for a dragon
2851,7402-90848-0039.flac,tell the first said father time that his reputation has been broken into a thousand pieces which have been picked up by his neighbors and carried home if he can persuade his neighbors to give them up
2852,7402-90848-0057.flac,the dragon was advancing toward her bobo ran down into the field and stood beside tilda ready to defend her to the end the dragon came nearer and nearer suddenly
2853,7402-90848-0024.flac,so bobo obediently let the shoes guide him at corners the shoes always turned in the right direction and if bobo forgot and blundered on the wrong way the shoes swiftly began to pinch his toes
2854,7402-90848-0036.flac,don't try to peek at it or open the box until the right time has come if you do the half hour will fly away and disappear forever farewell bobo said h kind young twelve o'clock who had been the simpleton's good friend
2855,7402-90848-0037.flac,i too have a gift for thee drink this cup of water to the last drop and the youth handed the simpleton a silver cup full to the brim of clear shining water now this water was the water of wisdom
2856,7402-90848-0043.flac,bobo with great goodness of heart took along this extraordinary object in the hope of finding its angry possessor farther on the lad encountered tilda's father the unhappy king and delivered his message
2857,7402-90848-0001.flac,and she smacked the poor lad soundly a dozen times a day did him no good whatever now it came to pass that one morning princess zenza the ruler of the land happened to pass by the cottage and heard bobo being given a terrible tongue lashing
2858,7402-90848-0026.flac,and as that day was drawing to a close turrets of a magnificent castle rose far away over the leaves of the forest bobo arrived at twilight
2859,7402-90848-0027.flac,he found himself in a beautiful garden lying between the castle walls and the rising slopes of a great mountain strange to say not a living creature was to be seen and though there were lights in the castle
2860,7402-90848-0035.flac,you have served faithfully and well said father time here is your reward and with these words he placed in bobo's hands a small square casket made of ebony the half hour lies inside
2861,7402-90848-0025.flac,for two days bobo walked inland toward the great mountain a warm wind blew the clouds and rain away the sun shone sweet and clear on the morning of the third day the simpleton entered a wood of tall silent trees
2862,7402-90848-0054.flac,things should be exactly as they were half an hour before he opened the cover of the ebony box something like a winged white flame escaped from it and flew hissing through the air to the sun
2863,7402-90848-0021.flac,looking about bobo found himself on a lovely island whose heart was a high mountain mass hidden in the fog still sweeping in from the sea there was not a house a road or a path to be seen
2864,7402-90848-0041.flac,twelve o'clock placed him behind him on the white charger and hurried away so fast they flew that bobo who was holding the ebony casket close against his heart was in great danger of falling off
2865,7402-90848-0018.flac,so bobo went aboard the ship and sailed out upon the dark sea for two days the weather was warm and clear but on the third day there came a dreadful storm and on the third night the vessel was driven far off her course into the unknown ocean
2866,7402-90848-0047.flac,and the breastplates of the armed men shining in the sun after a week of almost constant progress for the king was so anxious to see his beloved daughter that he would hardly give the cavalcade time to rest
2867,7402-90848-0017.flac,bobo asked the sailors if they had seen a lost half hour no said the sailors but we are going to the isles of iron suppose you go with us the lost half hour may be there
2868,7402-90848-0008.flac,when he returned the good kitchen maid said little for she feared lest some misadventure overtake the poor simpleton but when the chief cook wasn't looking she tucked ta fresh currant bun into bobo's pocket
2869,7402-90848-0002.flac,curious as to the cause of all the noise the princess drew rein and summoned bobo's mother to come near on hearing her story it occurred to the princess that so silly a lad might amuse her
2870,7402-90848-0022.flac,in which were a pair of wooden shoes above the shoes was a card saying simply
2871,7402-90848-0028.flac,there was not even a warder at the gate suddenly a great booming bell struck seven o'clock bobo began to hear voices and sounds and then before the humming of the bell had died away
2872,7402-90848-0020.flac,though pounded and battered by the foaming waves the simpleton at length managed to reach the beach and took refuge in a crevice of the cliff during the stormy night when the dawn broke all sign of the ship had disappeared
2873,7402-90848-0033.flac,bobo willingly agreed so twelve o'clock who was the youngest of the hours took him to the stables and showed him the little room in the turret that he was to have
2874,7402-90848-0059.flac,just as the dragon's mouth was its widest bobo who had been searching his pockets desperately hurled into it the lost temper there was a perfectly terrific bang as if a million balloons had blown up all at once
2875,7402-90848-0046.flac,all in splendid silks and soldiers in shining armor the delighted king rode off to claim his missing daughter from princess zenza so on they rode the harnesses jingling the bridle bells ringing
2876,7402-90848-0011.flac,who answered his polite question with a scream of rage a half hour he roared no i haven't seen your half hour i wouldn't tell you if i had what's more i don't want to see it
2877,7402-90848-0056.flac,and sure enough there was brave little tilda standing alone in a great field waiting for the dragon to come and take her away lumbering heavily along like a monstrous turtle and snorting blue smoke
2878,8747-293952-0090.flac,luckily alice was out of the way having gone to pay a visit but she was expected back momentarily and miss berengaria wished to get rid of julius before the girl returned she might be able to conceal her real feelings but
2879,8747-293952-0058.flac,i will no longer be bound to you i never loved you but i have always tried to see the best side of you but you have no good side you are a mean cowardly serpent and if bernard is alive i shall do my best to defend him
2880,8747-293952-0010.flac,he was naturally very pleased and was very attentive a complete rest is what you need he said to miss randolph
2881,8747-293952-0104.flac,i can vouch for his honesty he said but he talks too much he must hold his tongue here said the old dame severely and shaking her trowl at the boy where are his clothes i have none but what's on cried jerry
2882,8747-293952-0029.flac,why did you accept me then what else could i do it was sir simon's wish that we should marry and owing to my circumstances i had no choice in the matter during his life i was merely a puppet
2883,8747-293952-0087.flac,on durham and on alice malleson for this last reason he was introducing him into the house if bernard were alive as julius began to suspect he would come to one of these three people and then jerry would at once become aware of the fact
2884,8747-293952-0086.flac,i'm fly said master moon and began whistling julius looked at him with satisfaction he intended that the boy should remain in the neighborhood so as to keep watch on conniston
2885,8747-293952-0097.flac,it is not to lord conniston's credit but i must know the reason said the old dame sharply if you want me to take the lad into my service jerry in answer to a look of beryl's began to weep ostentatiously
2886,8747-293952-0024.flac,poor bernard's death has shaken me it is just as well he did die though i have been saying that said payne but i must take my leave i will come and see you again miss randolph and remember what i told you
2887,8747-293952-0028.flac,if we ever do marry said julius gloomily so far as i am concerned i should like to break the engagement julius we were never suited to one another beryl's vanity was hurt
2888,8747-293952-0065.flac,and then it depends upon him whether he is hanged or prefers to live abroad on a portion of his money the lesser portion i know the price of your silence said lucy vehemently you will want the hall and a large income
2889,8747-293952-0102.flac,yes sweet lady don't talk like that child call me ma'am
2890,8747-293952-0036.flac,there is always a chance that he may have escaped i sincerely trust not ah you always hated bernard on the contrary i speak for his good
2891,8747-293952-0000.flac,things went very smoothly at gore hall after durham had established lucy as its mistress during the absence of bernard the girl herself firmly believed that her cousin was dead and assumed deep mourning
2892,8747-293952-0023.flac,in schoolboy phrase a sneak i am just going mister beryl are you ill lucy asked beryl with affection i have an attack of nerves she replied pettishly
2893,8747-293952-0026.flac,why do you think bernard is innocent he asked because if he is guilty his action gives the lie to his whole life julius she replied raising herself on her elbow i can't believe he killed my uncle
2894,8747-293952-0092.flac,he is a lad i wish you to help said beryl blandly last time we met miss plantagenet you mentioned that you wanted a page not exactly a page said the old dame rubbing her nose
2895,8747-293952-0004.flac,knowing that she had married walter gore and although there was a flaw in the circumstances upon which she built her claim yet she trusted to her own cleverness to conceal this from the too clever lawyer but apart from this
2896,8747-293952-0085.flac,and dull said jerry putting his hands in his pockets lord what a bore stopping with her will be but i can nip over and see victoria when i like and keep an eye on lord conniston as i told you
2897,8747-293952-0073.flac,i am free now free she said stretching her hands oh what an escape i have had from that wicked man he has shown his hand too plainly i will put mister durham on his guard and
2898,8747-293952-0021.flac,but he could not always control it and was a kind hearted boy he is innocent i am sure how are you sure my dear lucy asked a third voice and she looked up to see julius standing in the doorway
2899,8747-293952-0070.flac,but you go too fast you can't yet prove that bernard lives i go to do so sneered julius and bowed himself ironically out of the room leaving lucy furious both with him and with herself
2900,8747-293952-0067.flac,you can tell him the whole of this conversation snarled beryl i am not afraid of durham if bernard is alive he'll have to pay up or be hanged he is innocent
2901,8747-293952-0027.flac,sir simon is not your uncle said beryl jealously you are only a distant relative perhaps my marriage with you may make me a nearer one
2902,8747-293952-0095.flac,i lived with grandmother at cove castle that's lord conniston's place said miss berengaria more perplexed than ever what were you doing there i lived with grandmother my name is jerry moon
2903,8747-293952-0037.flac,what's the use of his coming to life when he must suffer for his crime
2904,8747-293952-0016.flac,alice has such a tender heart doctor payne was doubtful so far as he saw miss malleson was remarkably cheerful under her sorrow she is philosophic miss randolph
2905,8747-293952-0008.flac,she had hitherto done no one could have been meeker and although miss randolph did not like or trust the woman she had no fault to find with her in any way lucy suffered severely from the shock of sir simon's tragic death
2906,8747-293952-0046.flac,the boy told me himself he will tell you if you like to see him i don't want to see him lord conniston is too kind a man to behave in that way he was fond of bernard
2907,8747-293952-0025.flac,rest in cheerful company miss malleson's for choice he departed smiling and they heard him gallop off when the sound of the horse's hoofs died away
2908,8747-293952-0018.flac,poor alice i wish bernard had lived
2909,8747-293952-0041.flac,this boy is a grandson of lord conniston's housekeeper missus moon at cove castle said lucy with some color in her face i know do you know lord conniston asked julius suspiciously i have met him once
2910,8747-293952-0099.flac,you should always hold your tongue said miss berengaria angrily you had no right to tell what lord conniston wished kept secret it was only a freak on his part he left the army at my request
2911,8747-293952-0045.flac,miss plantagenet wants a page i found this lad in london selling matches he was a messenger boy at a tobacconist called taberley and lord conniston got him turned out of the situation
2912,8747-293952-0061.flac,you take a high tone he said sneeringly but remember that if bernard is dead the money goes to charities so much the better you do not get it nor you either
2913,8747-293952-0054.flac,and then asked lucy starting up and facing beryl
2914,8747-293952-0005.flac,the fact that he suspected someone of passing himself off as bernard startled her and opened an abyss at her feet on leaving the office she judged it best to lower her crest for the moment and to wait patiently to see what would transpire
2915,8747-293952-0014.flac,i never saw a more attached couple did you ever meet him once at miss plantagenet's you know i am great friends with the old lady i often visit her not professionally for she is as healthy as a trout in a pond
2916,8747-293952-0032.flac,no bernard and i are like brother and sister but he is dead
2917,8747-293952-0093.flac,a sure sign she was perplexed merely a boy to see after the fowls and to wait about the house when necessary i love fowls said jerry sweetly and looking as innocent as a babe and dogs and things like that
2918,8747-293952-0062.flac,you will have to turn out of this luxurious home and live on the pittance sir simon left you would i be better off if i married you i think you would i have not much money now but i will have some
2919,8747-293952-0011.flac,and i will give you a tonic naturally you suffer from the terrible circumstances of sir simon's death he thought a moment
2920,8747-293952-0060.flac,i give you back your ring here it is she wrenched it from her finger now leave the house mister beryl i am mistress here julius looked at the ring which she had thrown at his feet and laughed
2921,8747-293952-0050.flac,lucy if you can find out from lord conniston or durham that bernard is alive let me know and i'll see what i can do to help him how can you help him when you believe him guilty i might help him to escape
2922,8747-293952-0007.flac,for one failure as it was she came back to the hall and behaved herself much better than she had ever done before she was respectful to lucy and did not display her impatience of commands that
2923,8747-293952-0053.flac,they will find it difficult to prove that sneered beryl with a white face i believe the fellow is alive after all
2924,8747-293952-0069.flac,whichever it is joy of a spit fire and an honest woman said miss randolph wrathfully for the reference to conniston touched her nearly
2925,8747-293952-0003.flac,she saw that she had gone too far and had given durham an inkling as to the possibility of michael having masqueraded as bernard
2926,8747-293952-0084.flac,you know nothing about such things corrected the respectable mister beryl severely i know a jolly sight more than you think said the urchin under his breath and producing a cigarette julius took it from him
2927,8747-293952-0020.flac,i do not believe he was
2928,8747-293952-0076.flac,he laughed and looked at the small boy trotting beside him i'm equal to both the boy was a handsome innocent looking little fellow rather undersized
2929,8747-293952-0103.flac,mister beryl such a kind gentleman ma'am said you would help me i will so long as you are honest jerry thrust his tongue in his cheek but julius answered
2930,8747-293952-0022.flac,he came forward forgive me if i heard a few words of your conversation but i have just come in doctor payne i hope i see you well quite well said the doctor who did not like beryl thinking him
2931,8747-293952-0013.flac,probably but she bears up wonderfully but that she is in mourning one would hardly guess she has sustained such a loss was she very much attached to mister gore yes
2932,8747-293952-0031.flac,you told sir simon about bernard being in love with alice that the poor boy might be disinherited beryl did not deny the charge i believe you are in love with bernard yourself he said
2933,8747-293952-0042.flac,he seems to be a most delightful fellow what a delightful speech for a lady said beryl conniston is a scamp i heard he enlisted in the lancers it shows how brave he is every man worth calling a man
2934,8747-293952-0039.flac,i am not hard hearted snapped beryl i always do good
2935,8747-293952-0072.flac,for conniston was one of those irresistible men who appeal to women lucy thought but it matters little what she thought all she knew was that her engagement to julius which had always weighed on her conscience was at an end
2936,8747-293952-0074.flac,here she blushed and lord conniston julius walking towards the bower was also angry with himself as lucy thought he had shown his hand too clearly
2937,8747-293952-0043.flac,should go to the front perhaps you would like me to go sneered julius you would never have the pluck said lucy quickly all your ends in life are gained by cunning
2938,8747-293952-0035.flac,mister durham requires proof of the death rejoined lucy sharply and until then he is bound to administer the estate according to the will as bernard's body has not been found
2939,8747-293952-0096.flac,his lordship got me a situation at a tobacconists said the child like moon and then he got me turned off why that's not like lord conniston
2940,8747-293952-0017.flac,i think however if you would have her over to see you it would do both her and yourself good i shall write a note to her to day said lucy i am very fond of her and we get on very well together
2941,8747-293952-0051.flac,i don't want to see him hanged he won't be hanged if lord conniston and mister durham can save him ah julius started to his feet then he is alive
2942,8747-293952-0049.flac,and i believe bernard may be alive after all in which case you would give him up to the police no said julius with an emotion which did him credit i should never betray him
2943,8747-293952-0019.flac,rising to take his leave if he was guilty ah said lucy raising herself with animation from the sofa upon which she was lying if he was guilty
2944,8747-293952-0030.flac,although you swore for an hour
2945,8747-293952-0055.flac,ah you would make him pay money to save himself i have a right to a portion of the estate you have not said miss randolph clenching her fists and all her languor gone bernard is the owner of gore hall
2946,8747-293952-0078.flac,but his mind had not yet had time to work on his face and the mask of his childhood for he was only thirteen concealed his evil nature successfully in a few years when his passions worked their way through the mask his face
2947,8747-293952-0047.flac,and that makes him perfect in your eyes said beryl looking savage see here lucy conniston has left the army so you see he is not so brave as you think
2948,8747-293952-0082.flac,they think i'm a kind of holy bill and i let em think so it pays jerry you are a young scamp of the worst the boy chuckled as though he had received a compliment i like doing things he explained frankly it's fun
2949,8747-293952-0109.flac,then he took his leave and the old lady watched him go
2950,8747-293952-0034.flac,he must know that bernard is dead seeing that the coat and hat were found on the banks of the river no man could have lived in the cold an the fog yet if durham was sure he would not hold the estate against bernard's coming
2951,8747-293952-0105.flac,the kind gentleman got them for me ma'am you are a better christian than i thought said miss berengaria looking at beryl well you can stay here boy go to the kitchen and tell the servants to give you something to eat
2952,8747-293952-0089.flac,and but for the sake of alice she would have refused to let him enter the bower as it was and with great diplomacy so great that it deceived even the astute beryl she asked him to come into the house
2953,8747-293952-0091.flac,alice being so young and impulsive might show her dislike too plainly and put beryl on his guard who is this you have here asked miss plantagenet putting on her spectacles and surveying jerry with admiration what a pretty lad
2954,8747-293952-0071.flac,she was angry with herself because she felt that in speaking of conniston she had colored and as a matter of fact she greatly admired the young lord even though they had only met once
2955,8747-293952-0079.flac,would be wrinkled and sinful his mind would have marked plainly its signet on the smooth surface but at present he looked charmingly innocent although he already knew much more about life than was good for him
2956,8747-293952-0080.flac,julius in order that the lad might make an impression on miss plantagenet had dressed him in a new suit and pleased with himself for much of the boy remained in this precocious criminal  young jerry trotted along smiling
2957,8747-293952-0108.flac,i must see that he doesn't swear or smoke or indulge in any of those wicked things i hope he will do your recommendation credit mister beryl i hope he will said julius and felt a strong inclination
2958,8747-293952-0002.flac,but now that she tasted the sweets of power she was not disposed to allow julius to treat her as he chose missus gilroy came back from her visit to the lawyer
2959,8747-293952-0056.flac,and of all the property and of the title also
2960,8747-293952-0106.flac,jerry grinned and duck towards the door good bye jerry said beryl kindly don't forget me if i do may i be oh no kind lady i mean ma'am i won't swear
2961,8747-293952-0101.flac,but turned the conversation defiantly
2962,8747-293952-0038.flac,you have no grounds for saying that said julius pale with rage i don't need grounds retorted the genuine woman bernard always was a kind hearted as you were and are the reverse
2963,8747-293952-0033.flac,lucy sat up on the sofa and pushed the loose hair back from her forehead why do you say that she asked sharply julius stared at the fire i can't understand durham's attitude he said evasively
2964,8747-293952-0100.flac,at your request said julius looking at her directly forearmed as she was miss berengaria with the consciousness of bernard's secret flushed through her withered skin
2965,8747-293952-0066.flac,all i can get rejoined beryl quietly and you have refused to share my fortune with me yes i will have nothing to do with you and remember that if i catch you plotting i will tell mister durham
2966,8747-293952-0107.flac,i never did having been to sunday school yes ma'am i am going and jerry in answer to an imperative wave of his new mistress's hand disappeared miss berengaria turned to beryl
2967,8747-293952-0063.flac,a great deal some day by blackmailing bernard said lucy indignantly julius picked up the ring and slipped it into his waistcoat pocket calmly we don't know that bernard is alive
2968,8747-293952-0075.flac,it would have been better he considered to have held my tongue i should have done so had she not goaded me into speech she will tell durham and that interfering conniston and put them on their guard well
2969,8747-293952-0094.flac,you seem a nice lad who is he mister beryl a poor boy who sold matches in london but i didn't always pipe jerry shifting from one leg to the other and feigned embarrassment and playing his part perfectly
2970,8747-293952-0040.flac,not always for instance i am down here to get a small boy a post with miss plantagenet as a page that is very good of you said lucy scornfully ah you see i can do a kind action
2971,8747-293952-0006.flac,missus gilroy was a well educated woman and very astute therefore she hoped to gain her ends by craft if not by force so far she had failed but she did not intend to abandon her claim
2972,8747-293952-0057.flac,his name will be cleared and then you will throw me over and try to become lady gore i throw you over now said lucy losing her temper and coloring hotly how dare you speak to me like this julius
2973,8747-293952-0059.flac,from your snares but lucy don't speak to me
2974,8747-293952-0001.flac,and felt his loss deeply it was her outspoken affection that provoked a quarrel between her and julius and which led to the breaking of their engagement lucy had a high temper which had been kept in subjection during the life of sir simon
2975,8747-293952-0044.flac,lucy if you talk to me like that began beryl and then restrained himself with an effort it is no use our quarrelling let me show you that i am not so careless of others or so hard hearted as i seem to be
2976,8747-293952-0098.flac,i saw his lordship dressed as a soldier he snuffled and i told mister beryl his lordship was so angry that he got me turned off saying i was ungrateful
2977,6925-80680-0058.flac,and strutted up and down in them admiring herself in the mirrors that lined the room
2978,6925-80680-0005.flac,mind you declare that the king is right it certainly was a jackal but if we say so the king will probably not keep his word about going away and we shall get into trouble so we had better take his side to this the other agreed
2979,6925-80680-0070.flac,then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry ameer ali
2980,6925-80680-0002.flac,if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen i say it was a tiger cried the king don't contradict me nonsense snapped the queen it was a jackal and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said at last very well
2981,6925-80680-0022.flac,amer ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back and so with a heavy heart he made his salutation and bade the old woman farewell but when he had gone a little way she called after him if ever you are in trouble or danger
2982,6925-80680-0019.flac,and on reaching the spot he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head
2983,6925-80680-0003.flac,we'll call the guard and ask and if it was a jackal i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away and if it was a tiger then you shall go and i will marry a new wife as you like answered the queen there isn't any doubt which it was
2984,6925-80680-0038.flac,but ameer ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck
2985,6925-80680-0034.flac,but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth if ever a man strayed into witchland the ogresses used to eat him up and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper
2986,6925-80680-0007.flac,and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood
2987,6925-80680-0027.flac,soon after this on a dark and stormy night when the river roared beneath the palace walls the sound of a woman weeping and wailing was heard above the storm the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter but the servant falling on his knees in terror
2988,6925-80680-0061.flac,and then she declared to her father that unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die again the king sent for ameer ali and ordered him to get a necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month or be put to a cruel death
2989,6925-80680-0021.flac,and as they drew near it ameer ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on at the sight of a stranger she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut and much as he wished to see her again
2990,6925-80680-0046.flac,or she would die of shame so the king sent for ameer ali
2991,6925-80680-0044.flac,that was the parrot's name how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel think snapped the parrot who was cross because they hadn't given him his bath that morning i think she looks like a washerwoman's daughter with one shoe on and the other off
2992,6925-80680-0041.flac,ameer ali himself was astonished for he had slipped the anklet into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since the king was delighted at its beauty and having praised and rewarded ameer ali he gave the anklet to his daughter a proud and spoiled princess
2993,6925-80680-0014.flac,very few ever came near them and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living but she and the wise farmer always counselled him to wait until
2994,6925-80680-0060.flac,she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up poor princess she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill
2995,6925-80680-0076.flac,well hasten then said the king i have no time to waste your majesty said the farmer has now lived and administered justice long in this city
2996,6925-80680-0000.flac,one hot night in hindustan a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice and they hoped they were going to sleep but they never did presently they became more broad awake than ever
2997,6925-80680-0077.flac,whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up
2998,6925-80680-0075.flac,who thought that they had as good a chance as any one else to gain both the throne and the princess as soon as the king was seated he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer
2999,6925-80680-0039.flac,and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness ameer ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an anklet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot
3000,6925-80680-0025.flac,the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more
3001,6925-80680-0032.flac,whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard
3002,6925-80680-0052.flac,and hold it over the cauldron and every drop of blood that falls from it into the water will become a jewel next you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet and the one at my feet stands at my head and place the severed foot against the wound and it will heal
3003,6925-80680-0063.flac,once more the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted
3004,6925-80680-0008.flac,and started home again now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back so she stayed quite still for a long time listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps
3005,6925-80680-0064.flac,and her head her words turned ameer ali pale with horror but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before and at last he consented to do as she bade him
3006,6925-80680-0043.flac,walking grandly about with her treasure tied round her ankle she heard the starling say to the parrot
3007,6925-80680-0023.flac,come to where you now stand and cry fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me now and i will listen to you the prince thanked her and continued his journey but he thought little of the old woman's saying and much of the lovely damsel
3008,6925-80680-0059.flac,and never recovered his temper until after lunch she's got all her beauty at one end of her now if she had a few of those fine gewgaus round her neck and wrists she would look better but now to my mind
3009,6925-80680-0069.flac,how do you think our princess is looking now very fine no doubt grumbled the parrot but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only she ought to have a husband why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things
3010,6925-80680-0053.flac,and i shall become quite well again as before at first
3011,6925-80680-0004.flac,so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them but whilst the dispute was going on the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other
3012,6925-80680-0055.flac,and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems his heart took courage very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron and he quickly changed the wands placed the severed foot against the wound and immediately the two parts became one as before
3013,6925-80680-0010.flac,but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions there was no sign of any human being then her spirit gave way and she began to cry it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest
3014,6925-80680-0071.flac,so the king sent for ameer ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honour of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne on hearing this speech
3015,6925-80680-0042.flac,now in the women's apartments in the palace there hung two cages in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling and these two birds could talk as well as human beings they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was
3016,6925-80680-0009.flac,but heard none after a while she grew nervous for she was all alone and put her head out of the palanquin and looked about her day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir
3017,6925-80680-0057.flac,but three rare and beautiful anklets and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts and the next day the vain princess put two anklets on each foot
3018,6925-80680-0079.flac,to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger the king turned first red and then pale there is continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne where
3019,6925-80680-0062.flac,and again ameer ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me
3020,6925-80680-0035.flac,in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue so when ameer ali questioned her she replied ah kind sir it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows help me to get him down and i will bless you for ever
3021,6925-80680-0013.flac,years passed without a sign from the king his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care though the queen still lived with the farmer and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong handsome and healthy youth out in the forest they seemed far from the world
3022,6925-80680-0024.flac,shortly afterwards he arrived at a city and as he was now in great straits
3023,6925-80680-0001.flac,at the sound of a howl outside the palace listen to that tiger remarked the king tiger replied the queen how should there be a tiger inside the city it was only a jackal i tell you it was a tiger said the king and i tell you that you were dreaming
3024,6925-80680-0050.flac,then there appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten what is the matter she asked in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb
3025,6925-80680-0020.flac,the old woman's face brightened she showed him where to seek the water and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim she led the way without a word and he followed in a short while they came to a hut in the forest
3026,6925-80680-0018.flac,presently as he made his way through a thicket he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner so he fired a pellet at it from his galail but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter at the same instant he heard a great clamour from beyond the thicket
3027,6925-80680-0048.flac,and inquired of every one where the finest jewels were to be got but though he sought night and day he never found one to compare with the anklet at last only a week remained and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the fairy of the forest
3028,6925-80680-0049.flac,therefore away he went and after a day's travelling he reached the cottage in the forest and standing where he had stood when the old woman called to him he cried fairy of the forest fairy of the forest help me help me
3029,6925-80680-0051.flac,then he told her his story and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart and then turning to him she said
3030,6925-80680-0012.flac,and when she had told her story the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on and in the farm a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named ameer ali
3031,6925-80680-0033.flac,or of the roaring river as for ghosts and witches they had never troubled him so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman what ails you he said now the woman was not really a woman at all
3032,6925-80680-0036.flac,ameer ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager
3033,6925-80680-0081.flac,then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up ameer ali and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside at the sight of her the king was filled with shame and self reproach and wished he could have lived his life over again
3034,6925-80680-0045.flac,why doesn't she wear two of them instead of going about with one leg adorned and the other empty when the princess heard this she burst into tears and sending for her father
3035,6925-80680-0040.flac,and as the storm had by this time passed over he made his way back to the palace when he had finished his story he took the anklet out of his pocket and handed it to the king who like everyone else was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it indeed
3036,6925-80680-0085.flac,she smiles at him and says is it the tiger then or the jackal
3037,6925-80680-0074.flac,so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighboring countries proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and heir to the throne should present himself at the palace when the day came all the court were gathered together and a great crowd assembled of men young and old
3038,6925-80680-0080.flac,growing pale as he listened in prison replied the farmer if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals i will explain clear the court commanded the king and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace now
3039,6925-80680-0006.flac,the king made no remark but sent for a palanquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it bidding the four bearers of the palanquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her in spite of her tears she was forced to obey
3040,6925-80680-0030.flac,but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water inch by inch and foot by foot he fought his way across now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy now narrowly escaping
3041,6925-80680-0083.flac,there is only one person i will marry said he and this time the maiden did not run away but agreed to be his wife so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily as for the old woman whose pitcher ameer ali had broken
3042,6925-80680-0078.flac,no your majesty answered the farmer i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered to day to try and claim your daughter and kingdom every city has sent them and they wait hungry and eager but do not o king mistake or pretend again
3043,6925-80680-0065.flac,from her severed hands and head there fell into the cauldron bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds
3044,6925-80680-0016.flac,a big brass pot to hold water a few pieces of silver
3045,6925-80680-0084.flac,she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl she gladly returned to fairyland the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife any more if he even looks as if he does not agree with her
3046,6925-80680-0072.flac,ameer ali bowed low and answered that he had done and would do the king all the service that lay in his power save only this one thing the king who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man flew into a passion and the princess was more furious still
3047,6925-80680-0047.flac,or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment poor ameer ali was greatly troubled at the king's command but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans he left the palace at once
3048,6925-80680-0015.flac,at last when he was eighteen years of age they had not the heart to forbid him any longer
3049,6925-80680-0031.flac,being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream at length he emerged panting and dripping wet on the other side close by the bank stood a gallows and on the gallows hung the body of some evil doer
3050,6925-80680-0066.flac,then the head and hands were joined on to the body and left neither sign nor scar full of gratitude ameer ali tried to speak to her but she ran into the house and would not come back and he was forced to leave her
3051,6925-80680-0056.flac,then the maiden opened her eyes sprang to her feet and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut and would not come out or speak to him any more
3052,6925-80680-0011.flac,where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbors as it was hot weather the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house but was awakened by the sound of weeping he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could and into the forest towards the place the sound came from
3053,6925-80680-0028.flac,begged that he might not be sent on such an errand particularly on a night so wild when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad indeed so frightened was he that the king who was very kind hearted bade another to go in his stead
3054,6925-80680-0026.flac,and promised that he should enter his body guard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous this is just what ameer ali wanted and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish
3055,6925-80680-0073.flac,ameer ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find and ordered to be kept there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death meanwhile the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay
3056,6925-80680-0082.flac,and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death my day is past said he and he gave up his crown to his son ameer ali who went once more and called to the forest fairy to provide him with a queen to share his throne
3057,6925-80680-0037.flac,and bent so that the old woman could clamber on to his back which she did very nimbly then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck
3058,6925-80680-0054.flac,at length she persuaded him to do her bidding he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off she lay as one lifeless but he held the severed foot over the cauldron and as drops of blood fell from it
3059,6925-80680-0067.flac,when on the day appointed ameer ali produced a necklace and bracelets each more beautiful and priceless than the last the king's astonishment knew no bounds and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy
3060,6925-80680-0017.flac,many a weary mile he tramped day after day until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred and he stepped joyfully into it like one who goes to meet an old friend
3061,6925-80680-0029.flac,but each one showed the same strange fear then ameer ali stepped forward this is my duty your majesty he said i will go the king nodded and off he went the night was as dark as pitch
3062,6925-80680-0068.flac,the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say
3063,7517-100442-0010.flac,there is only one profession to follow the profession of bookstall clerk to be behind a bookstall is indeed to see life the fascination of it struck me suddenly
3064,7517-100442-0003.flac,and lordly people like you and me with a pint of cherry gin is not this to follow the king of trades some day i shall open a grocer's shop and you will find me in my spare evenings
3065,7517-100442-0000.flac,at the bookstall i have often longed to be a grocer to be surrounded by so many interesting things sardines bottled raspberries
3066,7517-100442-0030.flac,one of our greatest soldiers i thought of these things last monday and definitely renounced the idea of becoming a grocer and as i wandered round the bookstall thinking
3067,7517-100442-0009.flac,i perceive now that i was over hasty in deciding to become a grocer that is rather for one's old age while one is young and interested in persons rather than in things
3068,7517-100442-0033.flac,that an interesting article might be extracted from it so i bought the book unfortunately enough i left it in the train before i had time to master it i shall be at the bookstall next monday
3069,7517-100442-0018.flac,the day can never be dull to the bookstall clerk i imagine him assigning in his mind the right paper to each customer this man will ask for golfing wrong
3070,7517-100442-0014.flac,with among others a middle aged woman as soon as we left liverpool street she produced a bag of shrimps grasped each individual in turn firmly by the head and tail
3071,7517-100442-0002.flac,at one moment to walk up a ladder in search of nutmeg at the next to dive under a counter in pursuit of cinnamon to serve little girls
3072,7517-100442-0029.flac,of major general clement bulger c b even then the man behind the bookstall is not found wanting if he is wrong the first time he never fails to recover with his second bulger sir
3073,7517-100442-0023.flac,rather overdoing the part after which he would hand over the winning post and the animal's friend to the pursuing detective in a sort of holy awe what a life
3074,7517-100442-0032.flac,such as have guided men along the path of truth since the beginning of the world from what ho she bumps to ichdin and more the thought occurred to me
3075,7517-100442-0001.flac,biscuits with sugar on the top preserved ginger hams brawn under glass everything in fact that makes life worth living
3076,7517-100442-0028.flac,and even when one of those subtler characters draws near about whom it is impossible to say immediately whether they require a fountain pen with case or the life and letters
3077,7517-100442-0022.flac,and they would be very rare his faith in human nature would begin to ooze away until all at once he would tell himself excitedly that the man was obviously an escaped criminal in disguise
3078,7517-100442-0012.flac,yes and he would know who bought all his papers and books and pamphlets and to know this is to know something about the people in the world
3079,7517-100442-0025.flac,he understands by now the type of man who wants to read up a few good jokes to tell them down at old robinson's where he is going for the week end our bookstall clerk doesn't wait to be asked
3080,7517-100442-0006.flac,but no currents this evening i beg you yes to be a grocer is to live well but after all it is not to see life a grocer
3081,7517-100442-0034.flac,and i shall have to buy another copy that will be all right you shan't miss it but i am wondering now what the bookstall clerk will make of me a man who keeps on buying proverbs and maxims
3082,7517-100442-0015.flac,and ate him when she had finished she emptied the enns out of the window wiped her hands and settled down comfortably to her paper what paper you'll never guess
3083,7517-100442-0031.flac,i came across a little book sixpence in cloth a shilling in leather called proverbs and maxims it contained some thousands of the best thoughts in all languages
3084,7517-100442-0017.flac,conceive the holy joy of the bookstall clerk as she and her bag of shrimps yes he could have told at once they were shrimps approached and asked for the morning post
3085,7517-100442-0005.flac,we grocers only put the currants out for show and so that we may run our fingers through them luxuriously when business is slack i have a good line in shortbreads madam if i can find the box
3086,7517-100442-0019.flac,he wants cage birds that one over there wants the motor ah well the auto car that's near enough soon he would begin to know the different types he would learn to distinguish
3087,7517-100442-0027.flac,who is always losing his india rubber umbrella ring half way across the station he can see him and he hastens to get a new card out in readiness or we would let you have seven for sixpence sir
3088,7517-100442-0011.flac,last monday and wondered who bought the tie clips the answer came to me just as i got into my train ask the man behind the bookstall he would know
3089,7517-100442-0008.flac,and to sell a man potted lobster is not to have our fingers on his pulse potted lobster does not define a man all customers are alike to the grocer provided their money is good
3090,7517-100442-0026.flac,as soon as this gentleman approaches he whips out the book dusts it and places it before the racontour he recognizes also at a glance the sort of silly ass
3091,7517-100442-0016.flac,i shall have to tell you the morning post now doesn't that give you the woman the shrimps alone no the paper alone no but the two together
3092,7517-100442-0020.flac,between the patrons of the dancing times and of the vote the era and the athenaeum delightful surprises would overwhelm him at intervals as when
3093,7517-100442-0013.flac,you cannot tell a man by the lobster he eads but you can tell something about him by the literature he reads for instance i once occupied a carriage on an eastern line
3094,7517-100442-0021.flac,a read letter day in all the great stations a gentleman in a check waistcoat makes the double purchase of homer's penny stories and the spectator on those occasions
3095,7517-100442-0007.flac,in as far as it is possible to a man who sells both scented soap and pilchards would become narrow we do not come into contact with the outside world much save through the medium of potted lobster
3096,7517-100442-0004.flac,apron behind the counter look out for the currents in the window as you come in i have an idea for something artistic in the way of patterns there but as you love me do not offer to buy any
3097,7517-100442-0024.flac,but he has other things than papers to sell he knows who buys those little sixpenny books of funny stories a problem which has often puzzled us others
3098,7517-100437-0027.flac,and recommended it to kenneth graham but perhaps i am wrong here for i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance nor as i have already lamented am i financially interested in its sale
3099,7517-100437-0000.flac,a household book once on a time i discovered samuel butler not the other two but the one who wrote the way of all flesh the second best novel in the english language
3100,7517-100437-0021.flac,whether it is well known or not it is the amazing truth that none of those hundreds had heard of the wind in the willows until i told them about it
3101,7517-100437-0019.flac,my answer to the question whether i had anything to say would be well my lord if i might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving mister justice darling
3102,7517-100437-0025.flac,none the less that your thanks were due for instance you may have noticed a couple of casual references to it as if it were a classic known to all in a famous novel
3103,7517-100437-0033.flac,but i must give you one word of warning when you sit down to it don't be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgment on my taste
3104,7517-100437-0012.flac,but when i ask you if you have read my book you will profess surprise and say that you have never heard of it is it as good as so and so and such and such you will ask
3105,7517-100437-0006.flac,but i dare not risk it the thought of your scorn at my previous ignorance of the world famous tillier your amused contempt because i have only just succeeded
3106,7517-100437-0029.flac,that it is what i call a household book by a household book i mean a book which everybody in the household loves and quotes continually ever afterwards a book which is read aloud
3107,7517-100437-0011.flac,of a well known writer when i tell you his name you will say oh yes i love his books and you will mention so and so and its equally famous sequel such and such
3108,7517-100437-0014.flac,i shall be quite content with your gratitude well the writer of my book is kenneth graham you have heard of him good i thought so the books you have read
3109,7517-100437-0032.flac,when he wrote it i hope this will please jones were his final words as he laid down his pen well of course you will order the book at once
3110,7517-100437-0013.flac,hardly believing that this could be possible much better i shall reply and there if these things were arranged properly would be another ten per cent in my pocket but believe me
3111,7517-100437-0034.flac,still less on the genius of kenneth graham you are merely sitting in judgment on yourself you may be worthy i do not know
3112,7517-100437-0009.flac,who has not read it in french or as i did in american let us pass on to another book for i am going to speak of another discovery
3113,7517-100437-0004.flac,who wrote in the early part of last century a book called
3114,7517-100437-0005.flac,my uncle benjamin i read it in the translation eager as i am to be lyrical about it i shall refrain i think that i am probably safer with tillier than with butler
3115,7517-100437-0026.flac,published last year it was i who introduced that novelist to it six months before indeed i feel sometimes that it was i who wrote the wind in the willows
3116,7517-100437-0008.flac,who has not heard of claudetillier
3117,7517-100437-0003.flac,in two glowing articles not unnaturally the world remained unmoved it knew all about samuel butler last week i discovered a frenchman
3118,7517-100437-0022.flac,some of them had never heard of kenneth graham well one did not have to meet them again and it takes all sorts to make a world but most of them were in your position
3119,7517-100437-0002.flac,well i discovered him just as voltaire discovered habacuk or your little boy discovered shakespeare the other day and i committed my discovery to the world
3120,7517-100437-0015.flac,are the golden age and dream days am i not right thank you but the book you have not read my book
3121,7517-100437-0024.flac,for their gratitude no doubt they also spread the good news in their turn and it is just possible that it reached you in this way but it was to me
3122,7517-100437-0010.flac,of a book which should be a classic but is not of a book of which nobody has heard unless through me it was published some twelve years ago the last published book
3123,7517-100437-0031.flac,who really appreciate it at its true value and that the others are scarcely worthy of it it is obvious you persuade yourself that the author was thinking of you
3124,7517-100437-0020.flac,would probably pretend that he had read it but he wouldn't deceive me for one cannot recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering
3125,7517-100437-0016.flac,the wind in the willows am i not right again ah i was afraid so the reason why i knew you had not read it is the reason why i call it my book
3126,7517-100437-0017.flac,for the last ten or twelve years i have been recommending it usually i speak about it at my first meeting with a stranger it is my opening remark just as yours is something futile about the weather
3127,7517-100437-0023.flac,great admirers of the author and his two earlier famous books but ignorant thereafter i had their promise before they left me and waited confidently
3128,7517-100437-0007.flac,in borrowing the classic upon which you were brought up this is too much for me let us say no more about it
3129,7517-100437-0028.flac,an explanation which suspicious strangers require from me sometimes i shall not describe the book for no description would help it but i shall just say this
3130,7517-100437-0018.flac,if i don't get it in at the beginning i squeeze it in at the end the stranger has got to have it some time should i ever find myself in the dock and one never knows
3131,7517-100437-0001.flac,i say the second best so that if you remind me of tom jones or the mayor of casterbridge or any other that you fancy i can say that of course that one is the best
3132,7517-100437-0030.flac,to every new guest and is regarded as the touchstone of his worth but it is a book which makes you feel that though everybody in the house loves it it is only you
3133,7517-100429-0025.flac,yet if our hostess were to see us marching out with an umbrella how odd she would think us where are you off to she would ask and we could only answer lamely
3134,7517-100429-0028.flac,what will happen then aldenham may know but we his guests do not some think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and the kitchen garden but for myself
3135,7517-100429-0006.flac,when the pond began to fill to strangers this may seem surprising and it is only fair to tell them the great secret which is that much of the surrounding land
3136,7517-100429-0019.flac,and they can be made more readily out of doors for supposing it is fine the fresh air calls you to be doing something and the sight of the newly marked tennis lawn
3137,7517-100429-0005.flac,thus the steps helped to make the pond a convenient rain gauge for obviously when only three steps are left uncovered as was the case last monday
3138,7517-100429-0010.flac,soothes us where the record of the ordinary pedantic raingauge would leave us infuriated it speaks much for my friend aldenham's breadth of view that he understood this
3139,7517-100429-0001.flac,alone or in company dry shod to its brink and estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen in the night the rybald call it the hippopotamus pond tracing
3140,7517-100429-0009.flac,has done the damage the soul yearns for something more startling than that the record of the pond
3141,7517-100429-0026.flac,er i was just going to er walk about a bit but now we tell her brightly i'm going to see the pond it must be nearly full won't you come to and with any luck she comes
3142,7517-100429-0000.flac,the pond my friend aldenham's pond stands at a convenient distance from the house and is reached by a well drained gravel path so that in any weather one may walk
3143,7517-100429-0013.flac,i am one of those who cannot write letters in another man's house and when my pipe is well alight i say to miss robinson or whoever it may be let's go and look at the pond
3144,7517-100429-0018.flac,must be a record but anyhow it is fairly fine now and what about a little lawn tennis or golf or croquet or and so the arrangements for the morning are made
3145,7517-100429-0022.flac,will be declined say come and look at the pond and the worst sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise and once he is out he is out
3146,7517-100429-0011.flac,and planned the pond accordingly a most necessary thing in a country house is that there should be a recognized meeting place
3147,7517-100429-0029.flac,i believe that we are promised something much bigger than that a man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives
3148,7517-100429-0030.flac,will help to celebrate it i have no doubt with an open air play tank drama or what not at any rate we have every hope that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible
3149,7517-100429-0003.flac,it is known simply as the pond a designation which ignores the existence of several neighboring ponds the gifts of nature and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man
3150,7517-100429-0008.flac,for when your whole day's cricket has been spoilt it is perfectly absurd
3151,7517-100429-0027.flac,to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond for there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full
3152,7517-100429-0031.flac,so that we may watch it fill again i must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond but all the same
3153,7517-100429-0014.flac,right oh she says willingly enough having spent the last quarter of an hour with the time's financial supplement all of the paper that is left to the women in the first rush for the cricket news
3154,7517-100429-0002.flac,a resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the zoo beneath the waters of which if you particularly desire to point the hippopotamus out to somebody he always lies hidden to the rest of us
3155,7517-100429-0007.flac,drain secretly into the pond too this seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers
3156,7517-100429-0023.flac,all this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents
3157,7517-100429-0016.flac,we have a little argument about it miss robinson being convinced that she stood on the second step after breakfast and miss smith repeating that it looks
3158,7517-100429-0020.flac,fills you with thoughts of revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before but indoors it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast and once there with all the papers
3159,7517-100429-0024.flac,from morning till night how tired we get of being indoors on these days even with the best of books the pleasantest of companions the easiest of billiard tables
3160,7517-100429-0032.flac,have fallen in the last three weeks
3161,7517-100429-0004.flac,for the pond is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious there are seven steps to the bottom of the pond and each step
3162,7517-100429-0015.flac,we wander down to the pond together and perhaps find brown and miss smith there a lot of rain in the night says brown it was only just over the third step after lunch yesterday
3163,7517-100429-0017.flac,by and by two or three others stroll up and we all make measurements together the general opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night
3164,7517-100429-0021.flac,to be disinclined to leave it till lunch time a man or woman as lazy as this must not be rushed say to such a one come and play and the invitation
3165,7517-100429-0012.flac,where the people who have been writing a few letters after breakfast may when they have finished meet those who have no intention of writing any and arrange plans with them for the morning
3166,2092-145706-0018.flac,there is a lake down there below us and anyone who bathes in it though he were at death's door becomes sound and well on the spot and those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill
3167,2092-145706-0039.flac,no matter how difficult he must succeed in it or die they did not think long but replied let him build your majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this and if he fails in the attempt
3168,2092-145706-0060.flac,for in a heap higher than the king's palace lay all the grain of the country and not a single stalk of corn had been left behind in any of the fields and how had all this been done
3169,2092-145706-0079.flac,go on go on and at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill howling horribly and showing their white teeth the king in his terror called out stop a moment i will give you half my kingdom
3170,2092-145706-0064.flac,the more angry he became for he could not in the face of his promise put the stranger to death he turned once more to the two brothers and said his diabolical magic has helped him again
3171,2092-145706-0028.flac,here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws for its front paws had both been broken in a trap ferko felt so sorry for the little beast
3172,2092-145706-0029.flac,that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner and washed its small paws with the healing water in a moment the mouse was sound and whole and after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows
3173,2092-145706-0005.flac,and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread and then to refuse to give him a bit of ours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs his eldest brother was delighted with this proposal
3174,2092-145706-0032.flac,i am most grateful for your kindness and shall reward you some day and with these words she flew away humming gaily then ferko wandered on for many a long day
3175,2092-145706-0016.flac,and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs he climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree
3176,2092-145706-0044.flac,be of good cheer and lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls and humming gaily she flew away again ferko went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished
3177,2092-145706-0021.flac,and so they flew away their words rejoiced ferko's heart and he waited impatiently till evening should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes
3178,2092-145706-0008.flac,and fasted all that day and the next night but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread
3179,2092-145706-0076.flac,increasing in number every moment till they could be counted by thousands he drove them all before him on to the hill where the king and his whole court and ferko's two brothers were standing only the lovely princess was not present
3180,2092-145706-0068.flac,and sat down on the stump of a tree wondering what he should do next suddenly a big wolf ran up to him and standing still said i'm very glad to see you again my kind benefactor
3181,2092-145706-0017.flac,is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighborhood i should just think there was replied the other many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world
3182,2092-145706-0001.flac,of her and their father the three set forth on their travels the youngest of the three brothers whose name was ferko was a beautiful youth with a splendid figure blue eyes fair hair
3183,2092-145706-0080.flac,if you will drive all the wolves away but ferko pretended not to hear and drove some more thousands before him so that everyone quaked with horror and fear then the king raised his voice again and called out
3184,2092-145706-0083.flac,he married her and was crowned king of the country and the wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes and ferko and his bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together
3185,2092-145706-0059.flac,and the whole court went out to see the wonder
3186,2092-145706-0009.flac,and break one of your legs then we will give you a bit of our bread at these words poor ferko wept more bitterly than before and bore the torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens
3187,2092-145706-0047.flac,this splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen bee who had summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her the king's amazement knew no bounds and the princess's eyes beamed with delight
3188,2092-145706-0082.flac,till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked brothers and ate them and the whole court up in a moment then ferko went straight to the palace and set the princess free and on the same day
3189,2092-145706-0054.flac,but he could think of no way of escape the sun sank to rest and night came on when a little mouse started out of the grass at ferko's feet and said to him i'm delighted to see you
3190,2092-145706-0007.flac,you ate your loaf in your sleep you glutton and you may starve as long as you like but you won't get a scrap of ours ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep but he said nothing
3191,2092-145706-0023.flac,till his eyes were damp with dewdrops and in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life before the moon was shining brightly and lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs
3192,2092-145706-0062.flac,and he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers who kept on repeating
3193,2092-145706-0035.flac,for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before his brothers noticed this and envy and jealousy were added to their fear so much so that they determined once more to destroy him
3194,2092-145706-0050.flac,and turning to the two brothers he said he has certainly accomplished the first task with the aid no doubt of his diaboligal magic but what shall we give him to do now
3195,2092-145706-0067.flac,and when the king saw this he ordered her to be shut up in a high tower and carefully guarded till the dangerous magician should either have left the kingdom or been hung on the nearest tree ferko wandered out into the fields again
3196,2092-145706-0071.flac,if that's all you want done answered the wolf you needn't worry yourself i'll undertake the task and you'll hear from me again before sunset to morrow
3197,2092-145706-0041.flac,as he was wandering disconsolately about the meadows round the palace wondering how he could escape being put to death a little bee flew past and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear
3198,2092-145706-0053.flac,the princess grew white with terror when she heard these words but ferko felt much more cheerful than he had done the first time and wandered out into the meadows again
3199,2092-145706-0046.flac,with sunflowers for knockers and all round hyacinths and other sweet smelling flowers bloomed in masses so that the air was perfumed far and near and enchanted all who were present
3200,2092-145706-0025.flac,he had not gone far before he met a wolf who was limping disconsolately along on three legs and who on perceiving ferko began to howl dismally my good friend said the youth
3201,2092-145706-0063.flac,than a wicked magician only the beautiful princess rejoiced over ferko's success and looked on him with friendly glances which the youth returned the more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him
3202,2092-145706-0081.flac,stop you shall have my whole kingdom if you will only drive these wolves back to the places they came from but the wolf kept on encouraging ferko and said go on go on so he led the wolves on
3203,2092-145706-0073.flac,and that he would never see her again if he left the country he lay down once more on the grass and soon fell fast asleep all the next day he spent wandering about the fields
3204,2092-145706-0034.flac,they had managed to obtain places in the king's service and when they recognized ferko with his eyes and legs sound and well they were frightened to death for they feared he would tell the king of their conduct
3205,2092-145706-0022.flac,at last it began to grow dusk and the sun sank behind the mountains gradually it became cooler on the hill and the grass grew wet with dew then ferko buried his face in the ground
3206,2092-145706-0074.flac,then return at once to me and get on my back and i will help you to drive all the wolves together then ferko went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done
3207,2092-145706-0011.flac,but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them for a second bit but the more ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger
3208,2092-145706-0019.flac,become as sharp sighted as the eagle even if they have been blind from their youth well answered the first raven my eyes are in no want of this healing bath for heaven be praised
3209,2092-145706-0070.flac,whose broken leg he had healed and told him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his life but how in the world he added am i to collect all the wolves in the kingdom on to that hill over there
3210,2092-145706-0003.flac,for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking ferko fell fast asleep but the other two remained awake and the eldest said to the second brother what do you say to doing our brother ferko some harm
3211,2092-145706-0010.flac,then he could stand it no longer and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out and his left leg to be broken when this was done he stretched out his hand eagerly for the piece of bread
3212,2092-145706-0040.flac,let him be hung the king was pleased with this proposal and commanded ferko to set to work on the following day the two brothers were delighted for they thought they had now got rid of ferko forever
3213,2092-145706-0038.flac,on condition you leave the country but if you cannot perform what i demand you shall be hung on the nearest tree and turning to the two wicked brothers he said suggest something for him to do
3214,2092-145706-0048.flac,on the delighted ferko but the two brothers had grown quite green with envy and only declared the more that ferko was nothing but a wicked magician
3215,2092-145706-0006.flac,and the two wicked wretches seized ferko's loaf and ate it all up while the poor boy was still asleep when he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread but his brothers cried out
3216,2092-145706-0077.flac,for she was shut up in her tower weeping bitterly the wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs but the king was overcome by a sudden terror
3217,2092-145706-0072.flac,and with these words he trotted quickly away then the youth rejoiced greatly for now he felt that his life was safe but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess
3218,2092-145706-0066.flac,before to morrow night if he does this he may go free if not he shall be hung as you have said at these words the princess burst into tears
3219,2092-145706-0069.flac,what are you thinking about all alone by yourself if i can help you in any way only say the word for i would like to give you a proof of my gratitude ferko at once recognized the wolf
3220,2092-145706-0031.flac,ferko was no less willing to help her than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing on the spot the queen bee was cured and turning to ferko she said
3221,2092-145706-0049.flac,the king although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his commands had been carried out was very vexed
3222,2092-145706-0043.flac,a palace shall be built unlike any that king has dwelt in before just stay here till i come again and tell you that it is finished having said this she flew merrily away and ferko
3223,2092-145706-0012.flac,the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day but when night came his endurance gave way and he let his right eye be put out
3224,2092-145706-0024.flac,then ferko crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water no sooner had he done so
3225,2092-145706-0051.flac,let us make it as difficult as possible and if he fails he shall die then the eldest brother replied the corn has all been cut but it has not yet been put into barns
3226,2092-145706-0026.flac,be of good cheer for i can soon heal your leg and with these words he poured some of the precious water over the wolf's paw and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours
3227,2092-145706-0055.flac,my kind benefactor but why are you looking so sad can i be of any help to you and thus repay your great kindness to me then ferko recognized the mouse whose front paws he had healed and replied
3228,2092-145706-0036.flac,they went to the king and told him that ferko was a wicked magician who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the princess then the king had ferko brought before him and said
3229,2092-145706-0002.flac,and a complexion like milk and roses his two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be
3230,2092-145706-0020.flac,they are as good as ever they were but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago so let us fly at once to the lake that i may be restored to health and strength again
3231,2092-145706-0027.flac,the grateful creature thanked his benefactor warmly and promised ferko to do him a good turn if he should ever need it ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field
3232,2092-145706-0065.flac,but now what third task shall we set him to do no matter how impossible it is he must do it or die the eldest answered quickly let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom on to this hill
3233,2092-145706-0061.flac,the little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the land to its help and together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom the king could not hide his amazement but at the same time his wrath increased
3234,2092-145706-0014.flac,poor ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly but no one heard him or came to his help night came on and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close
3235,2092-145706-0004.flac,he is so beautiful that every one takes a fancy to him which is more than they do to us if we could only get him out of the way we might succeed better i quite agree with you answered the second brother
3236,2092-145706-0057.flac,that needn't distress you much just trust in me and before the sun sets again you shall hear that your task is done and with these words the little creature scampered away into the fields
3237,2092-145706-0000.flac,cletka there was once upon a time a man and a woman who had three fine looking sons but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves let alone their children
3238,2092-145706-0042.flac,what is troubling you my kind benefactor can i be of any help to you i am the bee whose wing you healed
3239,2092-145706-0045.flac,the whole court went out to see the wonder and their astonishment was great at the sight which met their eyes a splendid palace reared itself on the hill just outside the walls of the city made of the most exquisite flowers
3240,2092-145706-0052.flac,let the knave collect all the grain in the kingdom into one big heap before to morrow night and if as much as a stalk of corn is left let him be put to death
3241,2092-145706-0078.flac,when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer and calling out to ferko he said enough enough we don't want any more but the wolf on whose back ferko sat said to its rider
3242,2092-145706-0056.flac,before to morrow night all the grain in the kingdom has to be gathered into one big heap and if as much as a stalk of corn is wanting i must pay for it with my life is that all answered the mouse
3243,2092-145706-0037.flac,you are accused of being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter and i condemn you to death but if you can fulfil three tasks which i shall set you to do your life shall be spared
3244,2092-145706-0075.flac,ferko himself returned to the fields and mounting on the wolf's back he rode to the wood close by quick as lightning the wolf flew round the wood and in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him
3245,2092-145706-0030.flac,ferko again proceeded on his journey but he hadn't gone far before a queen bee flew against him trailing one wing behind her which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird
3246,2092-145706-0015.flac,and could only crawl along the ground not knowing in the least where he was going but when the sun was once more high in the heavens ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him
3247,2092-145706-0013.flac,and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread after his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him
3248,2092-145706-0033.flac,and at length reached a strange kingdom here he thought to himself he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country for he had heard that the king's daughter
3249,2092-145706-0058.flac,ferko who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning the day passed slowly
3250,2092-145709-0003.flac,the poor beast was all torn and bleeding and the kind little princess was quite unhappy about it when the crow saw this it turned to her and said i am not really a black crow
3251,2092-145709-0006.flac,and don't forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night you must not scream out for if you give as much as a single cry my sufferings will be doubled
3252,2092-145709-0010.flac,when they had done this they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay and screaming and yelling all the time they dragged her towards the cauldron she nearly died with fright
3253,2092-145709-0012.flac,it thanked the princess most heartily for her goodness and said that its sufferings had already been greatly lessened now one of the princess's elder sisters who was very inquisitive
3254,2092-145709-0013.flac,that at last the good natured little princess consented but at midnight when the odd folk appeared the elder sister screamed with terror and from this time on the youngest princess
3255,2092-145709-0007.flac,the good natured princess at once left her home and her family and hurried to the ruined castle and took possession of the room with the golden bed
3256,2092-145709-0015.flac,the crow came and thanked her for her endurance and assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been and so two years passed away when one day the crow came to the princess and said
3257,2092-145709-0002.flac,and in this garden the youngest princess used often to walk one day when she was pacing to and fro under the lime trees a black crow hopped out of a rose bush in front of her
3258,2092-145709-0017.flac,and take possession of the belongings of my forefathers you must go out into the world and take service as a maidservant the young princess consented at once and for a whole year
3259,2092-145709-0018.flac,and had worked her little white hands weary she heard a rustling beside her and a cry of joy then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her who knelt down at her feet
3260,2092-145709-0019.flac,and kissed the little weary white hands i am the prince he said who you in your goodness when i was wandering about in the shape of a black crow freed from the most awful torments
3261,2092-145709-0009.flac,her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room they at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it
3262,2092-145709-0001.flac,about half a mile from the palace in which they lived there stood a castle which was uninhabited and almost a ruin but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers
3263,2092-145709-0011.flac,but she never uttered a sound then of a sudden the cock crew and all the evil spirits vanished at the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all around the room with joy
3264,2092-145709-0004.flac,but an enchanted prince who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery if you only liked princess you could save me but you would have to say good bye to all your own people
3265,2092-145709-0014.flac,insisted always on keeping watch alone so she lived in solitude all the daytime and at night she would have been frightened had she not been so brave but every day
3266,2092-145709-0016.flac,in another year i shall be freed from the spell i am under at present because then the seven years will be over but before i can resume my natural form
3267,2092-145709-0008.flac,when night approached she lay down but though she shut her eyes tight sleep would not come at midnight she heard to her great horror some one coming along the passage and in a minute
3268,2092-145709-0000.flac,kletka once upon a time there were three princesses who were all three young and beautiful but the youngest although she was not fairer than the other two was the most lovable of them all
3269,2092-145709-0005.flac,and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle there is one habitable room in it in which there is a golden bed there you will have to live all by yourself
3270,2092-145709-0021.flac,it was difficult to believe that it was the same for it had all been rebuilt and done up again
3271,2092-145709-0020.flac,come now to my castle with me and let us live there happily together so they went to the castle where they had both endured so much
3272,6437-66173-0007.flac,but on seeing me sweep across the yard whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling he called out lustily lay low conway here's young bailey conway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended for his head
3273,6437-66173-0008.flac,he reached forward one of his long arms he had arms like a windmill that boy and grasping me by the hair tore out quite a respectable handful the tears flew to my eyes
3274,6437-66173-0017.flac,but i was going to because he knows who put meeks's mortar over our door and i know well enough who did it it was that sneaking little malatter pointing at me oh by george i cried reddening at the insult
3275,6437-66173-0026.flac,the personal inconvenience i suffered from my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted on me indirectly by his persistent cruelty to little binny wallace i should have lacked the spirit of a hen if i had not resented it finally
3276,6437-66173-0049.flac,he had as we suspected witnessed the closing scene of the fight from the schoolroom window and the next morning after prayers i was not wholly unprepared when master conway and myself were called up to the desk for examination
3277,6437-66173-0055.flac,every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to fight if one boy mol treats another within school bounds or within school hours that is a matter for me to settle the case should be laid before me
3278,6437-66173-0042.flac,miss abigail opening the front door started back at my hilarious appearance i tried to smile upon her sweetly but the smile rippling over my swollen cheek and dying away like a spent wave on my nose
3279,6437-66173-0038.flac,i couldn't help saying to myself if this is victory how about that other fellow tom said harry blake hesitating well
3280,6437-66173-0057.flac,if there's any fighting to be done i am the person to be consulted i disapprove of boys fighting it is unnecessary and unchristian in the present instance i consider every large boy in this school at fault
3281,6437-66173-0059.flac,i now request bailey and conway to shake hands in the presence of the school and acknowledge their regret at what has occurred conway and i approached each other slowly and cautiously as if we were bent upon another hostile collision
3282,6437-66173-0032.flac,fight it out and don't give in while you can stand and see and don't give in when you can't see for i could stand very little and see not at all having pommelled the school pump for the last twenty seconds
3283,6437-66173-0061.flac,you can go to your seats said mister grimshaw turning his face aside to hide a smile i am sure my apology was a very good one i never had any more trouble with conway
3284,6437-66173-0027.flac,i am glad that i faced conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever i am glad that phil adams taught me to box and i say to all youngsters learn to box to ride to pull an oar and to swim
3285,6437-66173-0003.flac,he performed the feat unconsciously throughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a chronic state of dislocation indicating great mental agitation on the part of the owner we fully expected an outbreak from him at recess
3286,6437-66173-0022.flac,and you'll have the sun in his eyes behold us once more face to face like david and the philistine look at us as long as you may for this is all you shall see of the combat
3287,6437-66173-0004.flac,but the intermission passed off tranquilly somewhat to our disappointment at the close of the afternoon session it happened that binny wallace and myself having got swamped in our latin exercise
3288,6437-66173-0024.flac,you'll get no description of it from me simply because i think it would prove very poor reading and not because i consider my revolt against conway's tyranny unjustifiable i had borne conway's persecutions for many months with lamb like patience
3289,6437-66173-0037.flac,i felt that i was not only following my nose but following it so closely that i was in some danger of treading on it i seemed to have nose enough for the whole party my left cheek also was puffed out like a dumpling
3290,6437-66173-0018.flac,cool is the word said adams as he bound a handkerchief round my head and carefully tucked away the long straggling locks that offered a tempting advantage to the enemy whoever heard of a fellow with such a head of hair going into action
3291,6437-66173-0001.flac,his red hair seemed to change to a livelier red and his sallow cheeks to a deeper sallow as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our slates the next day in school he knew we were watching him and made sundry mouths
3292,6437-66173-0031.flac,it's quite right and justifiable if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger but don't say no because you fear a licking and say or think it's because you fear god for that's neither christian nor honest and if you do fight
3293,6437-66173-0015.flac,and put back my hair this last condition was rather a staggerer i shan't do nothing of the sort said conway sulkily then the thing must go on said adams with dignity
3294,6437-66173-0035.flac,the gentle soul had stood throughout the contest with his face turned to the fence suffering untold agony
3295,6437-66173-0023.flac,according to my thinking the hospital teaches a better lesson than the battle field i will tell you about my black eye and my swollen lip if you will but not a word of the fight
3296,6437-66173-0044.flac,captain nutter as the recognized professional warrior of our family could not consistently take me to task for fighting conway nor was he disposed to do so
3297,6437-66173-0058.flac,but as the offence is one of omission rather than comission my punishment must rest only on the two boys convicted of misdemeanor conway loses his recess for a month and bailey has a page added to his latin lessons for the next four recitations
3298,6437-66173-0021.flac,is your man ready asked phil adams addressing rogers ready keep your back to the gate tom
3299,6437-66173-0013.flac,the boys fell back perforce on the school yard just at this crisis a dozen or so of the templars entered the gate and seeing at a glance the belligerent status of conway and myself dropped bat and ball and rushed to the spot where we stood
3300,6437-66173-0062.flac,he and his shadow seth rodgers gave me a wide berth for many months nor was binny wallace subjected to further molestation miss abigail's sanitary stores including a bottle of opadeldoc were never called into requisition
3301,6437-66173-0005.flac,were detained in school for the purpose of refreshing our memories with a page of mister andrew's perplexing irregular verbs binny wallace finishing his task first was dismissed i followed shortly after
3302,6437-66173-0030.flac,that you have to say yes or no to a challenge to fight say no if you can only take care you make it plain to yourself why you say no it's a proof of the highest courage if done from true christian motives
3303,6437-66173-0053.flac,iam the boy to be blamed for i was the cause of the trouble this drew out the story of conway's harsh treatment of the smaller boys as binny related the wrongs of his playfellows saying very little of his own grievances
3304,6437-66173-0002.flac,and scowled in the most threatening way over his thumbs conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his own that of throwing his thumbs out of joint at will sometimes while absorbed in study or on becoming nervous at recitation
3305,6437-66173-0012.flac,it was a custom with the larger pupils to return to the playground after school and play baseball until sundown the town authorities had prohibited ball playing on the square and there being no other available place
3306,6437-66173-0048.flac,they'll be handy to have in the house says miss abigail grimly of course so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by mister grimshaw
3307,6437-66173-0010.flac,and keeping my eye fixed steadily on conway's in all of which i was faithfully following the instructions of phil adams whose father subscribed to a sporting journal conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude
3308,6437-66173-0040.flac,shouldn't wonder no he didn't broke in adams or he would have stopped it short meter
3309,6437-66173-0060.flac,we clasped hands in the tamest manner imaginable and conway mumbled i'm sorry iv fought with you i think you are i replied drily and i'm sorry i had to thrash you
3310,6437-66173-0050.flac,as the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of bailey versus conway i shall not report the trial further than to say that adams mardin and several other pupils testified to the fact
3311,6437-66173-0006.flac,and on stepping into the playground saw my little friend plastered as it were up against the fence and conway standing in front of him ready to deliver a blow on the upturned unprotected face whose gentleness would have stayed any arm but a cowards
3312,6437-66173-0039.flac,did you see mister grimshaw looking out of the recitation room window just as we left the yard no was he though i am sure of it
3313,6437-66173-0051.flac,that conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the temple school their evidence also went to show that conway was a quarrelsome character generally bad for conway seth rodgers on the part of his friend
3314,6437-66173-0000.flac,chapter ten i fight conway there was one person however who cherished a strong suspicion that the centipedes had had a hand in the business and that person was conway
3315,6437-66173-0054.flac,i noticed that mister grimshaw's hand unknown to himself perhaps rested lightly from time to time on wallace's sunny hair the examination finished mister grimshaw leaned on the desk thoughtfully for a moment and then said
3316,6437-66173-0016.flac,rogers as i understand it is your second conway bailey come here what's the row about he was thrashing binny wallace no i wasn't interrupted conway
3317,6437-66173-0029.flac,ever written for boys are these words learn to box then as you learn to play cricket and football not one of you will be the worse but very much the better for learning to box well
3318,6437-66173-0034.flac,convinced of my error i accepted his congratulations with those of the other boys blandly and blindly i remember that binny wallace wanted to give me his silver pencil case
3319,6437-66173-0046.flac,i believe it runs in the family i think said miss abigail without the faintest expression on her countenance that a tablespoonful of hot drop the captain interrupted miss abigail peremptorily
3320,6437-66173-0019.flac,muttered phil twitching the handkerchief to ascertain if it were securely tied he then loosened my gallowses braces and buckled them tightly above my hips now then bantam never say die
3321,6437-66173-0036.flac,escorted by two or three of the schoolfellows i walked home through the pleasant autumn twilight battered but triumphant as i went along my cap cocked on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye
3322,6437-66173-0014.flac,is it a fight asked phil adams who saw by our freshness that we had not yet got to work yes it's a fight i answered unless conway will ask wallace's pardon promise never to hector me in future
3323,6437-66173-0041.flac,well it can't be helped now i reflected as the monkey said when he fell out of the cocoanut tree added charley marden trying to make me laugh it was early candle light when we reached the house
3324,6437-66173-0009.flac,but they were not the tears of defeat they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature paid to the departed tresses in a second my little jacket lay on the ground and i stood on guard resting lightly on my right leg
3325,6437-66173-0011.flac,and there we were glaring at each other motionless neither of us disposed to risk an attack but both on the alert to resist one there's no telling how long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been interrupted
3326,6437-66173-0025.flac,i might have shielded myself by appealing to mister grimshaw but no boy in the temple grammar school could do that without losing cast whether this was just or not doesn't matter a pin since it was so a traditionary law of the place
3327,6437-66173-0052.flac,proved that i had struck the first blow that was bad for me if you please sir said binny wallace holding up his hand for permission to speak bailey didn't fight on his own account he fought on my account and if you please sir
3328,6437-66173-0047.flac,directing her to make a shade out of cardboard and black silk to tie over my eye miss abigail must have been possessed with the idea that i had taken up pugilism as a profession for she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders
3329,6437-66173-0033.flac,when conway retired from the field as phil adam stepped up to shake hands with me he received a telling blow in the stomach for all the fight was not out of me yet and i mistook him for a new adversary
3330,6437-66173-0020.flac,conway regarded these business like preparations with evident misgiving for he called rodgers to his side and had himself arrayed in a similar manner though his hair was cropped so close that you couldn't have taken hold of it with a pair of tweezers
3331,6437-66173-0028.flac,the occasion may come round when a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments will be of service to you in one of the best books
3332,6437-66173-0043.flac,produced an expression of which miss abigail declared she had never seen the like excepting on the face of a chinese idol she hustled me unceremoniously into the presence of my grandfather in the sitting room
3333,6437-66173-0045.flac,for the captain was well aware of the long continued provocation i had endured ah you rascal cried the old gentleman after hearing my story just like me when i was young always in one kind of trouble or another
3334,6437-66173-0056.flac,i disapprove of tale bearing i never encourage it in the slightest degree but when one pupil systematically persecutes a schoolmate it is the duty of some head boy to inform me no pupil has a right to take the law into his own hands
3335,6437-66172-0041.flac,to kill less than three birds with one stone did not suit our sanguinary purpose we disliked the widow not so much for her sentimentality as for being the mother of bill conway we disliked mister meeks not because he was insipid
3336,6437-66172-0005.flac,some occult association being established between a cent apiece and a centipedes suspended by a string round his neck the metals were worn next to the skin and it was while bathing one day at grave point with jack harris and fred langdon
3337,6437-66172-0012.flac,if you had advanced another inch you would have disappeared down an abyss three thousand feet deep i naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information a prick from some two pronged instrument evidently a pitchfork
3338,6437-66172-0015.flac,a second pistol shot was heard the something i stood on sunk with a crash beneath my feet and i fell two miles as nearly as i could compute it at the same instant the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes and i found myself standing in an empty hogshead
3339,6437-66172-0004.flac,though i was an active member of the body during the remainder of my residence at rivermouth and at one time held the ownerous position of f c first centipede each of the elect wore a copper scent
3340,6437-66172-0026.flac,to mystify the staid and slow going rivermauthians was our frequent pleasure several of our pranks won us such a reputation among the townsfolk that we were credited with having a large finger in whatever went amiss in the place one morning
3341,6437-66172-0001.flac,the distraction which prevailed in the classes the week preceding the fourth had subsided and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities excepting a noticeable want of eyebrows on the part of pepper whitcombe and myself
3342,6437-66172-0019.flac,i afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club for these initiations as you may imagine were sometimes very comical spectacles especially when the aspirant for centipedal honors happened to be of a timid disposition
3343,6437-66172-0008.flac,such was the modest title given to the loft over my friend's woodhouse my hands were securely pinioned and my eyes covered with a thick silk handkerchief at the head of the stairs i was told in an unrecognizable husky voice
3344,6437-66172-0024.flac,by these simple and ingenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition sometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter i have said that the society had no special object it is true there was a tacit understanding among us
3345,6437-66172-0009.flac,if i felt myself physically too weak to undergo the necessary tortures i replied that i was not too weak in a tone which i intended to be resolute but which in spite of me seemed to come from the pit of my stomach it is well
3346,6437-66172-0010.flac,a prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination and i was wondering what would come next
3347,6437-66172-0006.flac,that i had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch by a sight of these singular emblems as soon as i ascertained the existence of a boy's club of course i was ready to die to join it and eventually i was allowed to join
3348,6437-66172-0035.flac,and now he had caused us to be arraigned before justice clapham on a charge equally groundless and painful after much noisy discussion a plan of retaliation was agreed upon
3349,6437-66172-0032.flac,the trick as was afterwards proved had been played by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor we were indebted for our arrest to master conway who had slyly dropped a hint within the hearing of selectman mudge to the effect that
3350,6437-66172-0030.flac,when the captain dragged me ignominously from the haymow and conducted me more dead than alive to the office of justice clapham here i encountered five other pallid culprits who had been fished out of divers coal bens garrets and chicken coops
3351,6437-66172-0018.flac,the mystic twelve revolved about me this concluded the ceremony with a merry shout the boys threw off their masks and i was declared a regularly installed member of the r m c
3352,6437-66172-0040.flac,the ladies fondness and the gentleman's blindness were topics ably handled at every sewing circle in the town it was through these two luckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common enemy
3353,6437-66172-0039.flac,casting destructive glances across the street the artificial roses in her cap and her whole languishing manner saying as plainly as a label on a prescription to be taken immediately but mister meeks didn't take
3354,6437-66172-0002.flac,in august we had two weeks vacation it was about this time that i became a member of the rivermouth centipedes a secret society composed of twelve of the temple grammar schoolboys
3355,6437-66172-0027.flac,about a week after my admission into the secret order the quiet citizens awoke to find that the sign boards of all the principal streets had changed places during the night people who went trustfully to sleep in current square opened their eyes in honeysuckle terrace
3356,6437-66172-0016.flac,surrounded by twelve masked figures fantastically dressed one of the conspirators was really appalling with a tin saucepan on his head and a tiger skin sleigh robe thrown over his shoulders i scarcely need say
3357,6437-66172-0021.flac,in a low tone as if not intended for the ear of the victim diabulus fetch me the red hot iron the expedition with which that tongue would disappear was simply ridiculous
3358,6437-66172-0022.flac,our meetings were held in various barns at no stated periods but as circumstances suggested any member had a right to call a meeting each boy who failed to report himself was fined one cent
3359,6437-66172-0007.flac,the initiation ceremony took place in fred langdon's barn where i was submitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a timorous boy before being led to the grotto of enchantment
3360,6437-66172-0023.flac,whenever a member had reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend he called a meeting for instance immediately on learning the death of harry blake's great grandfather i issued a call
3361,6437-66172-0031.flac,to answer the demands of the outraged laws charliey marden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his father's house and looked like a recently exumed mummy there was not the least evidence against us and indeed we were wholly innocent of the offence
3362,6437-66172-0025.flac,that the centipedes were to stand by one another on all occasions though i don't remember that they did but further than this we had no purpose unless it was to accomplish as a body the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as individuals
3363,6437-66172-0020.flac,if he showed the slightest terror he was certain to be tricked unmercifully one of our subsequent devices a humble invention of my own was to request the blindfolded candidate to put out his tongue whereupon the first centipede would say
3364,6437-66172-0038.flac,were of a nature not to be misunderstood and were not misunderstood by any one but mister meeks himself the widow carried on a dressmaking establishment at her residence on the corner opposite meeks's drug store
3365,6437-66172-0029.flac,and six of the temple grammar school boys were summoned to appear before justice clapham having tearfully disclaimed to my grandfather all knowledge of the transaction i disappeared from the family circle and was not apprehended until late in the afternoon
3366,6437-66172-0036.flac,there was a certain slim mild apothecary in the town by the name of meeks it was generally given out that mister meeks had a vague desire to get married but being a shy and timorous youth lacked the moral courage to do so
3367,6437-66172-0003.flac,this was an honor to which i had long aspired but being a new boy i was not admitted to the fraternity until my character had fully developed itself it was a very select society the object of which i never fathomed
3368,6437-66172-0043.flac,on the following morning as the orderly citizens wended their way to church past the widow's abode their sober faces relaxed at beholding over her front door the well known gilt mortar and pestile which usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner
3369,6437-66172-0034.flac,it was unanimously resolved that conway's animosity should not be quietly submitted to he had sought to inform against us in the stage coach business he had volunteered to carry pettingill's little bill for twenty four ice creams to charley marden's father
3370,6437-66172-0028.flac,jones's avenue at the north end had suddenly become walnut street and peanut street was nowhere to be found confusion reigned the town authorities took the matter in hand without delay
3371,6437-66172-0037.flac,it was also well known that the widow conway had not buried her heart with the late lamented as to her shyness that was not so clear indeed her attentions to mister meeks whose mother she might have been
3372,6437-66172-0017.flac,that there were no vestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which i had passed so cautiously my ascent had been to the top of the hogshead and my descent to the bottom thereof holding one another by the hand and chanting a low dirge
3373,6437-66172-0044.flac,was recognized at once it spread like wildfire over the town and though the mortar and the placard were speedily removed our triumph was complete the whole community was on the broad grin and our participation in the affair seemingly unsuspected
3374,6437-66172-0014.flac,i have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by dismal groans from different parts of the grotto finally i was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an incalculable height
3375,6437-66172-0013.flac,gently checked my retreat i was then conducted to the brink of several other precipices and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms where the result would have been instant death if i had committed the least mistake
3376,6437-66172-0011.flac,the unknown voice then directed me to take ten steps forward and stop at the word halt i took ten steps and halted stricken mortal said a second husky voice more husky if possible than the first
3377,6437-66172-0033.flac,young bailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs when he was called upon to make good his assertion he was considerably more terrified than the centipedes though they were ready to sink into their shoes at our next meeting
3378,6437-66172-0000.flac,in the course of ten days i recovered sufficiently from my injuries to attend school where for a little while i was looked upon as a hero on account of having been blown up what don't we make a hero of
3379,6437-66172-0042.flac,like his own syrups but because the widow loved him bill conway we hated for himself late one dark saturday night in september we carried our plan into effect
3380,7190-90543-0035.flac,they are significant wigan but i cannot see yet in which direction they lead us we must wait for the moment there is nothing to be done i had become so accustomed to quarles jumping to some sudden conclusion that i was disappointed
3381,7190-90543-0038.flac,he had several cabinets in his room containing specimens and everything had been turned on to the floor and damaged more or less in fact although nothing had been taken the damage was considerable on the night of the burglary doctor wood was away from home
3382,7190-90543-0032.flac,it was so now you did not seem interested in the broken box of counters she said turning toward her grandfather i wonder wigan is that the clue quarles said quickly it creeps into my brain the counters were in a heap i said
3383,7190-90543-0000.flac,however obscure a mystery may be there is always some point or circumstance which if rightly interpreted will lead to its solution even in those crimes which have never been elucidated this point exists only it has never been duly appreciated
3384,7190-90543-0005.flac,there were several silver articles on the sideboard but these had not been touched the burglars appeared to have given all their attention to sir joseph's room which was in a state of confusion two cupboards and every drawer had been turned out and the contents thrown about in all directions
3385,7190-90543-0022.flac,the cigarette ends the dirty glasses and the biscuit crumbs seem to me rather gratuitous deceptions and wait said quarles you assume a little too much they would have deceived nine men out of ten you happen to be the tenth man
3386,7190-90543-0026.flac,i think that would entirely depend on the man's temperament professor
3387,7190-90543-0024.flac,why should you think so his manner was curious then there is only his own statement that nothing has been taken but supposing he wished to get rid of papers a
3388,7190-90543-0041.flac,the unexpected has happened i said no no the expected
3389,7190-90543-0020.flac,he said i think there was only one burglar but for some reason he thought it important that it should be believed there were more a very important point and a reasonable conclusion i fancy said quarles if you are right it narrows the sphere of inquiry
3390,7190-90543-0034.flac,did that strike you as significant asked quarles i cannot say it did
3391,7190-90543-0010.flac,was inclined to laugh at my question and proceeded to inform me that he had no family skeleton
3392,7190-90543-0009.flac,this was the obvious explanation but it did not satisfy me i questioned sir joseph about his papers had he any document which for private or public reasons some one might be anxious to obtain he said he had not
3393,7190-90543-0025.flac,would he not have robbed himself of something to make the affair more plausible said quarles the amateur constantly overlooks the obvious i answered the professor shook his head
3394,7190-90543-0036.flac,naturally i was not idle during the next few days but at the end of them i had learnt nothing then the unexpected happened on consecutive nights two doctors houses were burgled the first was in kensington
3395,7190-90543-0016.flac,had not been taken from sir joseph's box which contained only turkish ones and although they had apparently been thrown down carelessly there was no ash upon the carpet nor anywhere else
3396,7190-90543-0037.flac,rather than intended robbery nothing had been stolen but everything in his room was in disorder and a small and unique inlaid cabinet with a secret spring lock had been smashed to pieces several cigarette ends were on the floor
3397,7190-90543-0012.flac,but there were certain points against this idea no one had moved about the house during the night
3398,7190-90543-0011.flac,had never been in touch with any mysterious society
3399,7190-90543-0021.flac,narrows it very much taken with the other facts of the case exactly i answered there is a suggestion to my mind of amateurness in the affair i grant the safe was not a difficult one to break open but it had not been done in a very expert manner
3400,7190-90543-0027.flac,sir joseph's standing is very high sudden temptation or necessity may subvert the highest character i answered
3401,7190-90543-0045.flac,much depended upon the answer if he had
3402,7190-90543-0040.flac,for a revolver loaded in every chamber was found on one of the cabinets apparently having put it ready for use he had forgotten to take it away the doctor was furious at the wanton destruction of his specimens
3403,7190-90543-0018.flac,and probably a little of the liquid had been emptied out of this into the other two on inquiry one of the servants told me that only a very little of the spirit had been taken she also said there was only one biscuit left in the box last night and it was there now
3404,7190-90543-0031.flac,when a mystery was cleared up it was easy to say that zenah had put him on the right road and i considered it a whim of his more than anything else
3405,7190-90543-0001.flac,for which the detective first looks and since few crimes of any are committed without some definite reason it is most frequently found in the motive his almost superhuman power of recognizing this key cle was the foundation of christopher quarles's success
3406,7190-90543-0029.flac,not in answer to any direct question of mind showing that the ideas were in his mind why the explanation would be simple if he were the burglar of his own papers
3407,7190-90543-0017.flac,if my idea were correct it would mean that they had been put there on purpose to mislead i examined the three glasses on the dining room table there was the stain of lips at the rim of one but not of the other two only one had been drunk out of
3408,7190-90543-0023.flac,amateur or not we have to deal with a very smart man so don't underestimate the enemy wigan assuming this to be the work of an amateur to what definite point does it lead you to this question i replied did sir joseph maynard burgle his own house
3409,7190-90543-0039.flac,only servants being in the house the cook suffering from faceache had been restless all night but had heard nothing
3410,7190-90543-0008.flac,it looked as if the box had been knocked down and trodden on by mistake for the counters were in a little heap close to the broken fragments it appeared that the burglars must have been disturbed and had made off without securing their booty
3411,7190-90543-0004.flac,not a very difficult matter and had evidently gone to the dining room and helped themselves to spirits from a tantalus which was on the sideboard three glasses wich a little of the liquor left in them were on the table and near them were some biscuit crumbs
3412,7190-90543-0006.flac,but of an old fashioned type presenting little difficulty to experts in it besides papers and about seventy pounds in gold in a canvas bag
3413,7190-90543-0030.flac,i admit the argument is sound wygan but it does not creep into my brain with any compelling influence there is a link missing in the chain somewhere and he looked at zena his often repeated statement that she helped him by her questions had never impressed me very greatly
3414,7190-90543-0028.flac,when i questioned sir joseph about his papers his manner seemed curious as i have said he at once declared that he had no part in any government secret or mysterious society gratuitous information you understand
3415,7190-90543-0013.flac,the silver on the floor was scattered
3416,7190-90543-0042.flac,i've read every report but tell me yourself every detail i did so the same brand of cigarettes he asked no but all cheap american ones
3417,7190-90543-0003.flac,and soon after midnight the household had retired neither sir joseph nor lady maynard nor any of the servants were disturbed during the night but next morning it was found that burglars had entered they had got in by a passage window at the back
3418,7190-90543-0007.flac,presentations which had been made to him and some unique specimens of the queen anne period all this silver was upon the floor also the bag of money intact
3419,7190-90543-0046.flac,if the thief had not found what he wanted he would continue his search i argued for some reason he connected sir joseph maynard with the object of his search
3420,7190-90543-0033.flac,asked quarles no that would have scattered them more they were round and might have fallen over after having been put one upon another as one gathers coppers together when counting a number of them sir joseph picked them up
3421,7190-90543-0014.flac,and it looked as if it had been thrown aside carelessly as though it were not what the thieves were in search of and surely had they left in a hurry the bag of money would have been taken
3422,7190-90543-0019.flac,by doing so i certainly saved one valuable life possibly more than one that he was interested was shown by our adjournment to the empty room
3423,7190-90543-0002.flac,and his solution of the mysterious burglaries which caused such speculation for a time was not the least of his achievements sir joseph maynard the eminent physician of harley street had given a small dinner party one evening the guests left early
3424,7190-90543-0043.flac,you still think that nothing has happened
3425,7190-90543-0044.flac,no i hole to the one man theory and you are right he snapped i admit i might not have got upon the right track had you not made that discovery it was clever wigan it did not seem to help you to a theory i answered true
3426,7190-90543-0015.flac,moreover the cigarette ends and the dirty glasses suggested a certain leisurely method of going to work and men of this kind would not be easily frightened the cigarette ends puzzled me they were of a cheap american brand
3427,7190-90542-0081.flac,was among those hanging over the fire sir henry was for many years in borneo wagan for a large part of the time was up country helping to put down the head hunting which still existed there and still does exist according to all accounts when the natives think they can escape detection
3428,7190-90542-0082.flac,the horrible custom proved too much for his disease brain and fascinated him you see how my theory grew then i looked for the actual proof which we found last night
3429,7190-90542-0070.flac,my dear wigan he said when at last he condescended to talk it was zena who first set me on the right road when she remarked that a man who had walked in a ditch carrying a bag would arrest attention two points were suggested first
3430,7190-90542-0079.flac,and the insane desire proved irresistible he was cunning too he must know everybody in the neighborhood yet the man he killed was unknown we shall find presently i have no doubt that the victim was some wanderer returning unexpectedly to friends ind withan
3431,7190-90542-0069.flac,in the darkness before the dawn the man moved about the shed again and presently i heard him go patience whispered quarles as i started up to go after him he will not run away
3432,7190-90542-0072.flac,why should a head be required what kind of man would be likely to want a head
3433,7190-90542-0077.flac,he was saint enough to be somewhere where he was not known when this time of the year came around at the full moon he is always queer witness last night but he is only dangerous in january dangerous i mean without provocation
3434,7190-90542-0073.flac,i sought for some peculiarity in his manner and found none yet his history coincided with my theory you know nothing about him i suppose nothing rather an interesting career but with a hereditary taint in it quarles went on
3435,7190-90542-0083.flac,the arrest of sir henry buckingham caused an enormous sensation he was subsequently put into a lunatic asylum but where he died not many months afterward fortunately he had no children to run the risk of madness in their turn
3436,7190-90542-0080.flac,sir henry waiting in the wood perhaps for hours may have allowed others to pass before this man came he realized that he was a stranger and attacked him but the head
3437,7190-90542-0071.flac,that the man might not have far to go to reach a place of safety secondly that he had come prepared to take a head away with him a mere speculation you may say
3438,7190-90542-0075.flac,how have you learnt all this he is important enough to have some of his doings chronicled and he wrote some interesting articles for a country gentleman's newspaper about his normandy tour nature studies and such like another point both these murders happened at the time of the full moon
3439,7190-90542-0074.flac,his mother was eccentric her husband was rich enough to have her looked after at home had she been a poorer person she would have died in a madhouse religious mania hers was and her son had inherited it in a curious fashion
3440,7190-90542-0076.flac,i am not absolutely sure but i think you will find that for the last half dozen years sir henry has not been in england in january you think i think there would have been other heads missing if he had been quarles answered
3441,7190-90542-0078.flac,to preserve his secret i have little doubt he would go to any length that is why i warned you to be ready to shoot when we went upon our journey of discovery now this year he was in england illness had kept him to his house yonder
3442,7190-90542-0068.flac,and i waited expecting some further revelation listening for other footsteps none came the fire flickered lower and went out the moon had set and the cold of the early morning got into my bones
3443,7190-90542-0005.flac,he was often as astonished at my acument in following a clew as i was at his marvellous theories
3444,7190-90542-0016.flac,on this occasion i went to quarles with the object of interesting him in the wythan case and he forestalled me by beginning to talk about at the moment i entered the room here i may mention a fact which i had not discovered at first
3445,7190-90542-0061.flac,he was short thick set and quick in his movements
3446,7190-90542-0002.flac,but such was my case and since zena's manner did not suggest that she was particularly interested in me my love affairs seemed a rather hopeless one my association with christopher quarles has however
3447,7190-90542-0050.flac,the back part being closed in the roof was thatched with bark and dried bracken and against one end of the veranda was a notch tree trunk serving as a ladder as i expected said quarles with some excitement we must get on to the veranda for a moment
3448,7190-90542-0018.flac,the foreign cut of the clothes may be of importance he said i am not sure is this wood you mention of any great extent no it runs beside the road for two or three hundred yards toward wythan no it was near the with an end of it that the dead man was found
3449,7190-90542-0036.flac,quarle scrambled through a hedge into a wood by the roadside
3450,7190-90542-0027.flac,a mad doctor ben on brain experiments is that your theory wigan
3451,7190-90542-0063.flac,only the smoke curled about it then the man moved the wooden block to the side of the fire and sat down facing us the flickering flames throwing a red glow over him wiggan do you see whispered quarles not clearly we'll go nearer carefully
3452,7190-90542-0008.flac,it was not until some days later that the case came into my hands and in the interval the local authorities had not been idle it was noted that the man was poorly dressed that his hands proved he was used to manual labor but there was no mark either on his body or on his clothing
3453,7190-90542-0051.flac,i think we are alone here but keep your ears open the shed was evidently used sometimes there was a stone slab which had served as a fireplace and from a beam above hung a short chain on which a pot could easily be fixed we'll get away quickly said quarles
3454,7190-90542-0033.flac,the next afternoon he arranged a drive i thought we were going a witham but we turned away from the village and presently quarles stopped the carriage
3455,7190-90542-0000.flac,the identity of the final victim
3456,7190-90542-0058.flac,throwing the cave part of the pit into greater shadow than ever i cannot attempt to say how long we had waited in utter silence when quarles touched my arm someone was coming and with no particular stealth
3457,7190-90542-0042.flac,to this quarles pointed that is our way he said we'll use what cover we can we plunged into the wood again and were soon in the wilderness forcing our way sometimes with considerable difficulty through the undergrowth
3458,7190-90542-0067.flac,for an hour two three i don't know how long that horrible bundle swung over the fire and the man sat on his block of wood staring straight before him
3459,7190-90542-0022.flac,there was a moon that night wasn't there full or near it i returned and how soon was the alarm raised along the countryside
3460,7190-90542-0026.flac,one or two doubtful places i had dug up i think the murder must have taken the head with him to bury somewhere else asked quarles
3461,7190-90542-0065.flac,were five or six human heads blackened shrivelled faces which seemed to grin horribly as they swung deeply from side to side lit up by the flicker of the flame do you see wigan quarles asked again yes
3462,7190-90542-0009.flac,nor any papers in his pockets to lead to his identification so far as could be ascertained
3463,7190-90542-0038.flac,do you go armed always i answered i do sometimes he said tapping his pocket we might come up against danger if my theory is correct if i tell you to shoot shoot and quickly
3464,7190-90542-0028.flac,january the seventeenth nearly the same date as the english one said zena two years intervening i returned
3465,7190-90542-0059.flac,i heard footsteps on the raised floor of the shed a man's step and only one man's i heard him moving about for some time i think he came down the ladder once and went up again
3466,7190-90542-0055.flac,we go there again this evening he said after lunch next day so a restful afternoon will suit us it was getting dark when we set out and again quarles's unerring sense of locality astonished me he led the way without hesitation
3467,7190-90542-0035.flac,said quarles mind you wigan i'm very doubtful about my theory at least i am not certain that i shall find the facts i want a few hours will settle it one way or the other after walking along the road for about a mile
3468,7190-90542-0043.flac,once or twice the professor gave me a warning gesture but he did not speak he had evidently some definite goal and i was conscious of excitement as i followed him for an hour or more he turned this way and that exploring every little ravine he could discover
3469,7190-90542-0057.flac,but the professor was particular about our position we may have to creep a little nearer presently he whispered from here we can do so silence wigan and don't be astonished an anything the waiting seemed long moonlight was presently above us
3470,7190-90542-0014.flac,and the murder had remained a mystery these were the points known and conjectured when the case came into my hands and my investigations added little to them one point however impressed me i felt convinced that the man's clothes which were shown to me had not been made in england
3471,7190-90542-0049.flac,a pit i call it but it was as much a cave as a pit part of it running deeply into the earth and only about a third of it being open to the sky the cave part had a rough sandy floor and here was a long shed of peculiar construction
3472,7190-90542-0015.flac,they were poor worn almost threadbare but they had once been fairly good and the cut was not english that it was french i could not possibly affirm but it might be and so i fashioned a fragile link with the normandy crime
3473,7190-90542-0037.flac,should we meet any one blame me say i am a doddering old fool who would walk under the trees
3474,7190-90542-0020.flac,which is continued as a division between two fields which formd part of the farmland behind the wood bu walking along this the murderer might have left the wood without leaving tracks behind him a good point wigan and where would that ditch lead him eventually to the high road
3475,7190-90542-0041.flac,to our right was a large house only partially seen through its screen of trees but it was evidently mellow with age to our left toward what was evidently the extremity of the park was hilly ground which had been allowed to run wild
3476,7190-90542-0045.flac,and yet this is such a likely place there must be a way he was going forward again the hollow was surrounded by perpendicular walls of sand and chalk it was a pit in fact which nature had filled with vegetation the way we had come seemed the only way into it
3477,7190-90542-0003.flac,led to the solution of some strange mysteries and since my own achievements are sufficiently well known i may confine myself to those cases which single handed i should have failed to solve i know that in many of them i was credited with having unravelled the mystery
3478,7190-90542-0006.flac,perhaps his curious power was never more noticeable than in the case of the withan murder a farmer returning from medworth the neighboring market town one night in january
3479,7190-90542-0060.flac,then there was a light and sudden tiny flames in the dark he had evidently got fuel and had started a fire on the stone slab as the flames brightened i watched his restless figure he was not a young man
3480,7190-90542-0034.flac,five or six miles the road winds a lot it's a deal nearer as the crow flies you need not wait for us driver my friend and i are going to walk back the coachman pocketed his money and drove away couldn't keep him waiting all night as we may have to do
3481,7190-90542-0044.flac,grunting his disappointment each time he failed to find what he was looking for i said i wasn't certain he whispered when our path had led us into a damp hollow which looked as if it had not been visited by men for centuries my theory seems
3482,7190-90542-0011.flac,soon after the storm began and that the snow had hidden the murderer's tracks from the wood that snow had drifted down tof the dead body seemed to establish this theory
3483,7190-90542-0007.flac,by evening the clouds had gone the moon sailed in a clear sky and looking round to find the cause of his horse's unusual behavior the farmer saw a man lying on a heap of snow under the opposite hedge he was dead more he was headless
3484,7190-90542-0054.flac,he was always as secret as the grave until he had proved his theory and then he seemed anxious to forget the whole affair and shrank from publicity
3485,7190-90542-0029.flac,at that date said quarles you have a theory professor an outlandish one which would make you laugh no no i do not like being laughed at i never mention my theories until i have some facts to support them
3486,7190-90542-0048.flac,we'll go carefully said quarles there may be worse than poacher's traps here without help from me he dropped from the roof and i followed him the natural passage was winding and about fifty yards long and opened into another pit of some size
3487,7190-90542-0046.flac,ah this looks promising quarles said suddenly in a corner of the wall or to be more precise filling up a rent in it was a shed roughly built but with a door secured by a very businesslike lock i think the shed is climbable
3488,7190-90542-0031.flac,a few days later quarles telegraphed me to meet him at king's cross and we travelled north together wait he said when i began to question him i am not sure yet my theory seems absurd we are going to find out if it is
3489,7190-90542-0001.flac,as an excuse i talked over cases with him but he seldom volunteered an opinion often was obviously uninterested truth to tell i was not there for his opinion but to see his granddaughter a detective in love sound something like an absurdity
3490,7190-90542-0066.flac,and the man who is he on the bench yesterday sir henry buckingham
3491,7190-90542-0030.flac,i took the trouble to make inquiry whether any similar crime had happened in england in the january of the preceding year and had the same inquiry made in france there was no record of any murder bearing the slightest resemblance to the whip and tragedy
3492,7190-90542-0012.flac,and would be found buried in the wood it was not found however and the countryside was in a state bordering on panic for a few days the witha murder seemed unique in atrocities and then came a communication from the french police
3493,7190-90542-0017.flac,whenever he was interested in the case i was always taken into his empty room at other times we were in the dining room of the drawing room it was the empty room on this occasion and zena remained with us
3494,7190-90542-0040.flac,whether he had studied the topography of the neighborhood i cannot say but he did not hesitate in his direction until he reached a high knoll which was clear of the wood and commanded a considerable view we were trespassers in a private park
3495,7190-90542-0023.flac,and after going to the village the farmer returned to medworth for the police
3496,7190-90542-0021.flac,which runs almost at right angles to the wythan road much water in the ditch asked quarles half a foot when i went there
3497,7190-90542-0056.flac,i think we are first but great care is necessary he whispered we crept forward and concealed ourselves among the scrub vegetation which grew in that part of the pit which was open to the sky it was dark the longshed barely discernible

3500,7190-90542-0004.flac,but this was only because professor quarles persisted in remaining in the background if i did the spade work the deductions were his they were ll cases with peculiar features in them
3501,7190-90542-0019.flac,any traces that the head was carried to the wood the local authorities say yes and not a trace afterward the ground in the wood was searched at the time and i have been over it carefully since through one part of the wood there runs a ditch
3502,7190-90542-0013.flac,some two years ago an almost identical murder had been committed outside a village in normandy in this case also the head was missing and nothing had been found upon the body to identify the victim he was well dressed and a man who would be likely to carry papers with him but nothing was found
3503,7190-90542-0064.flac,from our new point of view i looked again the man's face was familiar but just then i could not remember who he was it was the bundle hanging over the fire which fascinated me tied together and secured in a network of string
3504,7190-90542-0032.flac,we took rooms at a hotel in medworth quarles explaining that our investigation might take some days next morning instead of going to wythan as i had expected he took me to the police court
3505,7190-90542-0039.flac,your life is likely to depend upon it and keep your ears open to make sure no one is following us he had become keen like a dog on the trail and old as he was seemed incapable of fatigue
3506,7190-90542-0047.flac,said quarles let's get on the roof i am not so young as i was so help me up it was not much help he wanted in a few moments we were on the roof as i thought he said
3507,7190-90542-0053.flac,i daresay one would be allowed to see over the house
3508,7190-90542-0062.flac,when he got down again i saw that a bundle was espended over the fire
3509,7190-90542-0024.flac,said zena and if he were met on the road carrying a bag he would arrest attention why carrying a bag asked quarles with the head in it she answered that's another good point wigan chuckled quarles of course
3510,7190-90542-0025.flac,the head may be buried in the wood said zena quarles looked at me inquiringly

3552,2911-7601-0033.flac,with a loud yell i threw open the lantern and leapt into the room he shrieked once once only in an instant i dragged him to the floor
3553,2911-7601-0013.flac,and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew back but no
3554,2911-7601-0025.flac,and fell full upon the vulture eye it was open wide wide open and i grew furious as i gazed upon it i saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue
3555,2911-7601-0044.flac,they chatted of familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more distinct it continued
3556,2911-7601-0030.flac,meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old man's terror must have been extreme it grew louder i say louder every moment
3557,2911-7601-0045.flac,and became more distinct i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definiteness until at length i found that the noise was not within my ears no doubt i now grew very pale but i talked more fluently
3558,2911-7601-0024.flac,stealthily until at length a simple dim ray like the thread of the spider
3559,2911-7601-0000.flac,true nervous very very dreadfully nervous i had been an am but why will you say that i am mad the disease has sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them
3560,2911-7601-0011.flac,so you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve i looked in upon him while he slept upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door
3561,2911-7601-0029.flac,but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray
3562,2911-7601-0019.flac,deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart
3563,2911-7601-0038.flac,no blood spot whatever i had been too wary for that a tub had caught all ha ha
3564,2911-7601-0031.flac,do you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous so i am and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror
3565,2911-7601-0020.flac,when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could not he had been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the chimney
3566,2911-7601-0021.flac,it is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which is made a single chirp yes he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions but he had found all in vain all in vain because death
3567,2911-7601-0042.flac,i took my visitors all over the house i bade them search search well i led them at length to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of my confidence
3568,2911-7601-0016.flac,for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listening just as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall
3569,2911-7601-0008.flac,oh you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in i moved it slowly very very slowly so that i might not disturb the old man's sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening
3570,2911-7601-0012.flac,never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers of my sagacity i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to think that there i was opening the door little by little
3571,2911-7601-0005.flac,i made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye for ever now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely i proceeded
3572,2911-7601-0003.flac,it haunted me day and night object there was none passion there was none i loved the old man he had never wronged me he had never given me insult for his gold i had no desire i think it was his eye
3573,2911-7601-0006.flac,with what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation i went to work i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him and every night about midnight i turned the latch of his door and opened it
3574,2911-7601-0010.flac,for it was not the old man who vexed me but his evil eye and every morning when the day broke i went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a hearty tone and inquiring how he had passed the night
3575,2911-7601-0043.flac,placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily
3576,2911-7601-0009.flac,so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed hah would a madman have been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room i undid the lantern cautiously oh so cautiously
3577,2911-7601-0014.flac,his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness for the shutters were close fast through fear of robbers and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door
3578,2911-7601-0047.flac,i talked more quickly more vehemently but the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would they not be gone
3579,2911-7601-0049.flac,i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it grew louder louder louder and still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled
3580,2911-7601-0007.flac,oh so gently and then when i had made an opening sufficient for my head i put in a dark lantern all closed closed that no light shone out and then i thrust in my head
3581,2911-7601-0035.flac,i removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was stone stone dead i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead his eye would trouble me no more
3582,2911-7601-0032.flac,yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must burst and now a new anxiety seized me the sound would be heard by a neighbor the old man's hour had come
3583,2911-7601-0051.flac,but anything was better than this agony anything was more tolerable than this derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i felt that i must scream or die and now again hark louder louder
3584,2911-7601-0048.flac,i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observations of the men but the noise steadily increased oh god what could i do i foamed i raved i swore
3585,2911-7601-0034.flac,to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was dead
3586,2911-7601-0028.flac,such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old man's heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage
3587,2911-7601-0026.flac,with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but i could see nothing else of the old man's face or person for i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot
3588,2911-7601-0022.flac,in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room
3589,2911-7601-0037.flac,and deposited all between the scantlings i then replaced the board so cleverly so cunningly that no human eye not even his could have detected anything wrong there was nothing to wash out no stain of any kind
3590,2911-7601-0039.flac,it was four o'clock still dark as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a knocking at the street door i went down to open it with a light heart for what had i now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves
3591,2911-7601-0004.flac,yes it was this he had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye with a film over it whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold and so by degrees very gradually
3592,2911-7601-0002.flac,i heard many things in hell how then am i mad hearken and observe how healthily how calmly i can tell you the whole story it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but once conceived
3593,2911-7601-0050.flac,was it possible they heard not almighty god no no they heard they suspected they knew they were making a mockery of my horror this i thought and this i think
3594,2911-7601-0023.flac,when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down i resolved to open a little a very very little crevice in the lantern so i opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily
3595,2911-7601-0040.flac,with perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been lodged at the police office and they the officers
3596,2911-7601-0015.flac,steadily i had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in bed crying out who's there i kept quite still and said nothing
3597,2911-7601-0027.flac,and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the sense now i say there came to my ears
3598,2911-7601-0001.flac,above all was the sense of hearing acute i heard all things in the heaven
3599,2911-7601-0041.flac,had been deputed to search the premises i smiled for what had i to fear i bed the gentleman welcome the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i mentioned was absent in the country
3600,2911-7601-0017.flac,presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was a groan of mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of grief oh no
3601,2911-7601-0046.flac,and with a heightened voice yet the sound increased and what could i do it was a low dull quick sound much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breath and yet the officers heard it not
3602,2911-7601-0018.flac,when overcharged with awe i knew this sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world slept
3603,2911-15045-0004.flac,and from the carolinas to hudson's bay was divided between two great families of tribes distinguished by a radical difference of language a part of virginia and of pennsylvania new jersey southeastern new york new england

3606,2911-15045-0027.flac,then after many a day of lonely travel the voyager found a savage welcome among the nipessings on the lake which bears their name and then circling west and south for a hundred and fifty miles of solitude
3607,2911-15045-0006.flac,westward the eries along the southern shore of lake erie and the neutral nation along its northern shore from niagara
3608,2911-15045-0022.flac,and as the voyager passed some wooded point or thicket covered island the whistling of a stone headed arrow proclaimed perhaps the presence of these fierce marauders at montreal there was no human life save during a brief space in early summer
3609,2911-15045-0026.flac,it was nearly three hundred miles by the windings of the stream before one reached that algonquin tribe

3636,3486-166446-0031.flac,the thing quieted it began its steady effortless striding through the crowding trees but now with none of that speed with which it had come spurred forward by norhala's awakened hate ventnor stirred
3637,3486-166446-0027.flac,save for the bridge of our voices it separated us from ruth as though she stood upon another world higher we rose the three of us now upon the flat top of a tower upon whose counterpart fifty feet away
3638,3486-166446-0042.flac,it was no globe it was a world of many facets of smooth and polished plains
3639,3486-166446-0014.flac,and it was well done sister now you and i shall dwell together in peace sister or if there be those in the world from which you came that you would have slain
3640,3486-166446-0017.flac,and at last it was twin sister of norhala who looked upon her from the face of ruth the white arms of the woman encircled her the glorious head bent over her flaming tresses mingled with tender brown curls
3641,3486-166446-0041.flac,in it something ominous something sinister it swelled to a crescendo abruptly ceased and now i saw norhala raise her head listen i saw a world a vast world goodwin marching stately through space
3642,3486-166446-0005.flac,but in the eyes of ruth was none of this sternly coldly triumphant indifferent to its piteousness as norhala herself she scanned the waste that less than an hour since had been a place of living beauty i felt a shock of repulsion after all
3643,3486-166446-0008.flac,there was dried blood on the edges a double ring of swollen white flesh rimming the censure it was the mark of torture martin i cried that ring what did they do to you they waked me with that he answered quietly
3644,3486-166446-0039.flac,as i told you or think i told you speaking with unthinkable effort through lips that seemed eternities away from me the atam who strove to open them

3647,3486-166446-0032.flac,purged not only by suffering but by it came to me some strange knowledge no use drake he said dreamily
3648,3486-166446-0034.flac,it is the crisis he answered we can do nothing goodwin nothing whatever is to be steps forth now from the womb of destiny again there came that distant rolling louder now again the thing trembled
3649,3486-166446-0012.flac,before my eyes they tortured my brother norhala they were evil all evil norhala you did well to slay them she caught the woman's hands pressed close to her
3650,3486-166446-0010.flac,they tortured him they gave him agony until he returned and they promised him other agonies that would make him pray long for death and me me she raised little clenched hands
3651,3486-166446-0030.flac,stood for an instant at the brink of the green forest there came to us as though from immeasurable distances a faint sustained thrumming like the beating of countless muffled drums the thing that carried us trembled the sound died away
3652,3486-166446-0036.flac,and as motionless ruth martin i cried once more a dreadful dobt upon me martin what do you mean whence did they come his voice was clear and calm the eyes beneath
3653,3486-166446-0011.flac,me they stripped like a slave they led me through the city and the people mocked me
3654,3486-166446-0016.flac,and as they rose steadily they drew life from the clear radiance summoning drew closer to the semblance of that tranquil spirit which her vengeance had banished
3655,3486-166446-0018.flac,sister she whispered little sister these men you shall have as long as it pleases you to do with as you will or if it is your wish they shall go back to their world and i will guard them to its gates
3656,3486-166446-0033.flac,but this i do know only one way or another can the balance fall and if it be one way then you and we shall have ruth back and if it falls the other way then there will be little need for us to care for man will be done martin what do you mean
3657,3486-166446-0006.flac,yet mother and blossoming maid youth and oldster all the pageant of humanity within the great walls were now but lines within the stone according to their different lights it came to me there had been
3658,3486-166446-0029.flac,silently we streamed through the chasm through the canyon and the tunnel speaking no word drake's eyes fixed with bitter hatred upon norhala ventnor brooding upon her always with that enigmatic sympathy we passed between the walls of the further cleft
3659,3486-166446-0026.flac,it was as though norhala had decreed it as a symbol of this her second victory or had set it between us as a barrier wider grew the rift
3660,3486-166446-0023.flac,there was a curious understanding in his voice a curious sympathy too in the patient untroubled gaze that dwelt upon his sister and this weirdly exquisite woman who held her wait exclaimed drake wait hell the damned witch is stealing her away from us
3661,3486-166446-0025.flac,like metal waves back into it rushed the enigmatic billows that had washed over the fragments of the city we were lifted between us and the woman and girl a cleft appeared it widened into a rift
3662,3486-166446-0007.flac,from norhala of course i looked for no perception of any of this but from ruth my reaction grew
3663,3486-166446-0004.flac,dwelt curiously upon the red brand across ventnor's forehead
3664,3486-166446-0003.flac,now in the painful surges of awakening realization of full human understanding of that inhuman annihilation i turned to them for strength faintly i wondered again at ruth's scantiness of garb her more than half nudity
3665,3486-166446-0019.flac,but you and i little sister will dwell together in the vastness in the peace shall it not be so with no faltering with no glance toward us three
3666,3486-166446-0020.flac,lover brother old friend ruth crept closer to her rested her head upon the virginal royal breasts it shall be so she murmured sister it shall be so norhala i am tired norhala i have seen enough of men
3667,3486-166446-0035.flac,is it taps for them the drumming died as i listened fearfully about us was only the swishing the sighing of the falling trees beneath the tread of the thing motionless stood norhala
3668,3486-166446-0028.flac,quietly it glided to the chasm it had blasted in the cliff wall the shadow of those walls fell upon us as one we looked back as one we searched out the path of blue with the black blot at its breast we found it then the precipices hid it
3669,3486-166446-0015.flac,then you and i shall go forth with our companies and stamp them out even as i did these my heart stopped beating for from the depths of ruth's eyes shining shadows were rising wraiths answering norhala's calling
3670,3486-166446-0000.flac,chapter twenty seven the drums of destiny slowly we descended that mount of desolation lingeringly as though the brooding eyes of norhala were not yet sated with destruction
3671,3486-166446-0013.flac,norhala gazed at her from great gray eyes in which the wrath was dying into which the old tranquillity the old serenity was flowing and when she spoke the golden voice held more than returning echoes of the far away faint chimings it is done she said
3672,3486-166446-0024.flac,again he threw himself forward recoiled as though swept back by an invisible arm fell against us and was clasped and held by ventnor and as he struggled the thing we rode halted
3673,3486-166446-0002.flac,palace temple and home norhala had stamped flat she had crushed them within the rock even as she had promised the tremendous tragedy had absorbed my every faculty
3674,3486-166446-0040.flac,revelations i know not what to call them and though each seemed equally real of two of them only one i think can be true and of the third that may some time be true but surely is not yet through the air came a louder drum roll
3675,3486-166446-0022.flac,ruth cried drake and sprang toward them she paid no heed and even as he leaped he was caught whirled back against us wait said ventnor
3676,3486-166446-0001.flac,of human life of green life of life of any kind there was none
3677,3486-166424-0024.flac,natures summoning of every reserve to meet that peril my eyes took them in with photographic nicety the linked mail lacquered blue and scarlet of the horsemen brown padded armor of the footman
3678,3486-166424-0045.flac,globes and cubes and pyramids not small like those of the ruins but shapes all of four feet high dully lustrous and deep within that lustre the myriads of tiny points of light like unwinking staring eyes
3679,3486-166424-0065.flac,rested my gaze from the hollow turned she lay fainting in drake's arms beside the two the swathed woman stood looking out upon that slaughter calm and still shrouded with an unearthly tranquillity
3680,3486-166424-0001.flac,of what powers small like these or or quick on the screen of my mind flashed two pictures side by side
3681,3486-166424-0071.flac,it threw them broken and torn far toward the valley's sloping sides it left only fragments that bore no semblance to men ventnor was at tchiu ming's head i dropped beside him there was a crimson froth upon his lips
3682,3486-166424-0002.flac,the little four rayed print in the great dust of the crumbling ruin and its colossal twin on the breast of the poppied valley i turned aside crept through the shattered portal and looked over the haunted hollow unbelieving i rubbed my eyes
3683,3486-166424-0000.flac,as i gazed upon them i wondered to what secret place within their brooding immensities the little metal mysteries had fled and to what myriads it might be of their kind
3684,3486-166424-0055.flac,they sliced into the close packed forward ranks of the armored men cut out of them two great gaps sickened i saw fragments of man and hoarse fly another arm javelined from its place like a flying snake clicked at the end of another
3685,3486-166424-0057.flac,all that host which had driven us from the ruins threw down sword spear and pike fled shrieking the horsemen spurred their mounts riding heedless over the footmen who fled with them the smiting thing seemed to watch them go
3686,3486-166424-0053.flac,preening testing itself like an athlete
3687,3486-166424-0063.flac,it was i think that last touch of sheer horror the playfulness of the smiting thing that sent my dry tongue to the roof of my terror parched mouth and held open with monstrous fascination eyes that struggled to close
3688,3486-166424-0009.flac,down it was pouring an avalanche of men i caught the glint of helmets and corselets those in the van were mounted galloping two abreast upon sure footed mountain ponies their short swords lifted high flickered
3689,3486-166424-0020.flac,we dropped upon our knees sent shot after shot into them they fell back hesitated we sprang up sped on all too short was the check but once more we held them and again now ruth and dick were a scant fifty yards from the crevice i saw him stop
3690,3486-166424-0047.flac,up from them thrust a thick rectangular column
3691,3486-166424-0016.flac,he reached out touched me you're right walter he grinned it does seem like carrying coals to newcastle
3692,3486-166424-0049.flac,with magical quickness the arms lengthened before us stood a monstrous shape a geometric prodigy
3693,3486-166424-0011.flac,the rush was checked for an instant milling upon the road dick i cried rush ruth over to the tunnel mouth we'll follow we can hold them there i'll get martin chuming after the pony quick i pushed the two over the rim of the hollow
3694,3486-166424-0004.flac,a hare sat upright in the middle of the ancient roadway the valley itself lay serenely under the ambering light smiling peaceful emptied of horror
3695,3486-166424-0039.flac,they stood in silence like automatons only their fiercely staring eyes showing that they were alive quick breathed ventnor we ran toward her who had checked death even while its jaws were closing upon us
3696,3486-166424-0034.flac,they shone from her white face not phosphorescent not merely lucent and light reflecting but as though they themselves were sources of the cold white flames of far stars and as calm as those stars themselves
3697,3486-166424-0040.flac,before we had gone halfway as though our flight had broken whatever bonds had bound them a clamor arose from the host a wild shouting a clanging of swords on shields i shot a glance behind they were in motion advancing slowly
3698,3486-166424-0007.flac,even the ruins had lost their sinister shape were time worn crumbling piles nothing more
3699,3486-166424-0067.flac,were they maddened by fear driven by despair determined to slay before they themselves were slain i do not know but those who still lived from the men from the tunnel mouth were charging us they clustered close their shields held before them
3700,3486-166424-0070.flac,i saw a spear thrown it struck the chinaman squarely in the breast he tottered fell upon his knees even as he dropped the giant flail swept down upon the soldiers it swept through them like a scythe through ripe grain
3701,3486-166424-0010.flac,after the horsemen swarmed foot soldiers a forest of shining points and dully gleaming pikes above them clearly to us came their battle cries again ventnor's rifle cracked one of the foremost riders went down another stumbled over him fell
3702,3486-166424-0028.flac,we've saved ruth anyway he said drake ought to be able to hold that hole in the wall he's got lots of ammunition on the pony but they've got us another wild shouting down swept the pack
3703,3486-166424-0052.flac,again in gigantic awful parody of the spiked gloves of those ancient gladiators who fought for imperial nero
3704,3486-166424-0037.flac,i saw the two walk toward her chiu ming hang back the great eyes fell upon ventnor and myself she raised a hand motioned us to approach i turned there stood the host that had poured down the mountain road
3705,3486-166424-0075.flac,high up in the darkening heavens the lamargiers the winged scavengers of the himalaas were gathering the woman lifted her hand beckoned us once more slowly we walked toward her stood before her
3706,3486-166424-0013.flac,all my ammunition is on him chiu ming's taking care of that i gasped we darted out of the gateway a good five hundred yards away were ruth and drake running straight to the green tunnel's mouth between them and us was chiu ming urging on the pony
3707,3486-166424-0036.flac,the woman stepped from the crevice not fifty feet from her were ruth and drake and chiu ming their rigid attitudes revealed the same shock of awe that had momentarily paralyzed me she looked at them beckoned them
3708,3486-166424-0046.flac,they swirled eddied and formed a barricade between us and the armored men down upon them poured a shower of arrows from the soldiers i heard the shouts of their captains they rushed they had courage those men yes again came the woman's cry
3709,3486-166424-0042.flac,their gaze fastened upon the swathed woman ventnor's hand shot out gripped my shoulder halted me she had thrown up her head
3710,3486-166424-0056.flac,became a hundred foot chain which swirled like a flail through the huddling mass down upon a knod of the soldiers with a straightforward blow drove a third arm driving through them like a giant punch
3711,3486-166424-0038.flac,horsemen spearsmen pikemen a full thousand of them at my right were the scattered company that had come from the tunnel entrance three score or more there seemed a spell upon them
3712,3486-166424-0026.flac,in this world of ours twenty centuries beyond their time swiftly accurately even as i scanned them we had been drilling into them they advanced deliberately heedless of their fallen their arrows had ceased to fly
3713,3486-166424-0012.flac,quick mart i shouted up the shattered stairway we can get through the hollow ruth and drake are on their way to the break we came through hurry all right just a minute he called i heard him empty his magazine with almost machine gun quickness
3714,3486-166424-0015.flac,fell far short don't look back grunted ventnor stretch yourself walter there's a surprise coming hope to god i judge the time right we turned off the ruined way
3715,3486-166424-0066.flac,viewing it it came to me with eyes impersonal cold indifferent as the untroubled stars which look down upon hurricane and earthquake in this world of ours there was a rushing of many feet at our left a wale from chiu ming
3716,3486-166424-0043.flac,from the lifted throat came a low a vibrant cry harmonious weirdly disquieting golden and sweet and laden with the eerie minor wailings of the blue valley's night the dragoned chamber
3717,3486-166424-0025.flac,their bows and javelins and short bronze swords their pikes and shields and under their round helmets their cruel bearded faces white as our own where the black beards did not cover them their fierce and mocking eyes
3718,3486-166424-0027.flac,i wondered why for now we were well within their range
3719,3486-166424-0031.flac,a woman beautiful awesome incredible she was tall standing there swathed from chin to feet in clinging veils of pale amber she seemed taller even than tall drake
3720,3486-166424-0059.flac,they scattered running singly by twos and little groups for the sides of the valley they were like rats scampering in panic over the bottom of a great green bowl and like a monstrous cat the shape played with them yes played
3721,3486-166424-0060.flac,it melted once more took new form where had been a pillar in flailing arms was now a tripod thirty feet high its legs alternate globe and cube and upon its apex a wide and spinning ring of sparkling spheres
3722,3486-166424-0022.flac,a chance gasped ventnor behind us was a wolflike yelping the first pack had reformed had crossed the barricade the dynamite had made was rushing upon us i ran as i had never known i could
3723,3486-166424-0051.flac,flexing themselves in grotesque imitation of a boxer
3724,3486-166424-0019.flac,drake heard for he changed his course to the crevice at whose mouth ruth had said the little things had lain after him streaked chiu ming urging on the pony shouting out of the tunnel down over the lip of the bowl leaped the soldiers
3725,3486-166424-0021.flac,push her from him toward it she shook her head now chiu ming was with them ruth sprang to the pony lifted from its back a rifle then into the mass of their pursuers drake and she poured a fusillade they huddled wavered broke for cover
3726,3486-166424-0006.flac,gone was that soul of loneliness vanished the whirlpool of despair that had striven to drag us down to death the bowl was nothing but a quiet smiling lovely little hollow in the hills i looked back
3727,3486-166424-0014.flac,as we sped after him i looked back the horsemen had recovered were now a scant half mile from where the road swept past the fortress i saw that with their swords the horsemen bore great bows a little cloud of arrows sparkled from them
3728,3486-166424-0069.flac,i heard chiu ming scream saw him throw up his hands cover his eyes run straight upon the pikes chiu ming i shouted chiu ming this way i ran toward him
3729,3486-166424-0073.flac,at the side of the crevice stood the woman her gaze resting upon drake his arms about ruth her head hidden on his breast the valley was empty save for the huddled heaps hat dotted it
3730,3486-166424-0072.flac,i thought that shinji was about to slay us he whispered fear blinded me his head dropped his body quivered lay still we arose looked about us dazedly
3731,3486-166424-0048.flac,eight feet in width and twenty feet high it shaped itself out from its left side from right side sprang arms fearful arms that grew and grew as globe and cube and angle raced up the column side and clicked into place each upon each after the other
3732,3486-166424-0023.flac,over us wind the bullets from the covering guns close were we now to the mouth of the fissure if we could but reach it close close were our pursuers too the arrows closer no use said ventnor
3733,3486-166424-0061.flac,out from the middle of this ring stretched a tentacle writhing undulating like a serpent of steel four score yards at least in length
3734,3486-166424-0018.flac,and holding ruth by the hand raced back toward us even as he turned the vine screened entrance through which we had come through which we had thought lay safety streamed other armored men we were outflanked to the fissure shouted ventnor
3735,3486-166424-0074.flac,high up on the mountain path a score of figures crept all that were left of those who but a little before had streamed down to take us captive or to slay
3736,3486-166424-0064.flac,ever the armored men fled from it and ever was it swifter than they teetering at their heels on its tripod legs from half its length the darting snake streamed red rain i heard a sigh from ruth
3737,3486-166424-0058.flac,with amusement before they could cover a hundred yards it had disintegrated i heard the little wailing sounds then behind the fleeing men close behind them rose the angled pillar intook place sprang the flexing arms and again it took its toll of them
3738,3486-166424-0029.flac,we leaped to our feet sent our last bullets into them stood ready rifles clubbed to meet the rush i heard ruth scream what was the matter with the armored men why had they halted
3739,3486-166424-0008.flac,a rifle shot rang out above us another and another from the portal scampered chiu ming his robe ducked up about his knees they come he gasped they come
3740,3486-166424-0035.flac,and in that face although as yet i could distinguish nothing but the eyes i sensed something unearthly god whispered ventnor what is she
3741,3486-166424-0062.flac,with the three long prongs of this triden the thing struck swiftly
3742,3486-166424-0050.flac,a shining angular pillar that though rigid immobile seemed to crouch b instinct with living force striving to be unleashed two great globes surmounted it
3743,3486-166424-0041.flac,hesitatingly as yet but i knew that soon that hesitation would pass that they would sweep down upon us engulf us to the crevice i shouted to drake he paid no heed to me nor did ruth
3744,3486-166424-0068.flac,they had no bows these men they moved swiftly down upon us in silence swords and pikes gleaming the smiting thing rocked toward us the metal tentacle straining out like a rigid racing serpent flying to cut between its weird mistress and those who menaced her
3745,3486-166424-0054.flac,under the darkening sky in the green of the hollow the armored hosts frozen before it and then it struck out flashed two of the arms with a glancing motion with appalling force
3746,3486-166424-0030.flac,what was it at which they were glaring over our heads and why had the rifle fire of ruth and drake ceased so abruptly simultaneously we turned within the black background of the fissure stood a shape an apparition
3747,3486-166424-0032.flac,yet it was not her height that sent through me the thrill of awe of half incredulous terror which relaxing my grip let my smoking rifle drop to the earth nor was it that about her proud head a cloud of shining tresses swirled and pennoned
3748,3486-166424-0005.flac,i dropped over the side walked cautiously down the road up which but an hour or so before we had struggled so desperately paced farther and farther with an increasing confidence and a growing wonder
3749,3486-166424-0044.flac,before the cry had ceased there poured with incredible swiftness out of the crevice score upon score of the metal things the fissures vomited them
3750,3486-166424-0033.flac,like a misty banner of woven copper flames no nor that through her veils her body gleamed faint radiance it was her eyes her great wide eyes whose clear depths were like pools of living starfires
3751,3486-166424-0017.flac,scattered prone among these were men and horses others staggered screaming on the further side of this stony dike our pursuers were held like rushing waters behind a sudden fallen tree timed to u second cried ventnor hold him for a while
3752,3486-166424-0003.flac,then leaped to the very brim of the bowl a lark had risen from the roof of one of the shattered heaps and had flown carrolling up into the shadowy sky a flock of the little willow warblers flung themselves across the valley scolding and gossiping
3753,125-121124-0032.flac,she could not endure that insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel and is she gone the other night she left
3754,125-121124-0022.flac,but whom are you seeking debray i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man
3755,125-121124-0020.flac,it has been mentioned but the article is not mine
3756,125-121124-0075.flac,from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs but to return to our millions
3757,125-121124-0008.flac,everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in study
3758,125-121124-0063.flac,but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt
3759,125-121124-0067.flac,and who bowed to me as though he knew me
3760,125-121124-0009.flac,a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others he was punctual dressed in black with crape round his hat
3761,125-121124-0077.flac,now i think of it you can do better said danglars how do you mean
3762,125-121124-0040.flac,are neapolitan bonds said monte cristo no said danglars smiling
3763,125-121124-0062.flac,the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five million from you
3764,125-121124-0057.flac,i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence
3765,125-121124-0003.flac,and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur's study
3766,125-121124-0007.flac,shall you be present in the reception room no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office i shall work doctor
3767,125-121124-0046.flac,you therefore still owe me five million and a hundred thousand francs i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six million between us
3768,125-121124-0047.flac,and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand
3769,125-121124-0018.flac,the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us who is he
3770,125-121124-0060.flac,at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank
3771,125-121124-0002.flac,he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night
3772,125-121124-0043.flac,one two three four five said monte cristo five million why what a crossus you are this is how i transact business said danglars it is really wonderful said the count above all
3773,125-121124-0072.flac,i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son what example they gave all their fortune to the hospitals what fortune their own
3774,125-121124-0038.flac,that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so
3775,125-121124-0044.flac,it is indeed said danglars it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done five million on five little scraps of paper it must be seen to be believed
3776,125-121124-0011.flac,equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess gradually the reception room filled
3777,125-121124-0001.flac,which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric
3778,125-121124-0056.flac,there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously
3779,125-121124-0023.flac,his banker danglars is his banker is he not asked chateau renaud of debray i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel
3780,125-121124-0026.flac,for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of
3781,125-121124-0051.flac,that is being wrested from its grasp suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance certainly he said your receipt is money
3782,125-121124-0065.flac,how so the count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by thomson and french of rome he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank my funds are deposited there and you can understand
3783,125-121124-0053.flac,while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair yes keep it keep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time
3784,125-121124-0087.flac,fool then enclosing monte cristo's receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve o'clock i shall then be far away then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes
3785,125-121124-0014.flac,less owing to his social position than to his personal merit the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves
3786,125-121124-0028.flac,but we all have our faults do you know count that persons of our time of life not that you belong to the class you are still a young man but as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year
3787,125-121124-0081.flac,ah youare laughing at me send to morrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands
3788,125-121124-0082.flac,no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background bah you are wrong how ere you to blame in that affair
3789,125-121124-0039.flac,there was a moment's silence during which the noise of the banker's pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt moulding on the ceiling are they spanish hatian
3790,125-121124-0012.flac,and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray
3791,125-121124-0042.flac,to the governor of the bank please pay to my order from the fun deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account baron danglars
3792,125-121124-0030.flac,and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter
3793,125-121124-0068.flac,five million here is his receipt believe your own eyes
3794,125-121124-0029.flac,for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonoured and dead
3795,125-121124-0064.flac,you did see him i think yes well
3796,125-121124-0031.flac,eugenie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children do you think so indeed i do
3797,125-121124-0088.flac,burned several papers left others exposed to view
3798,125-121124-0079.flac,certainly it will only cost you a discount of five thousand or six thousand francs the receiver started back ma foi he said i prefer waiting till to morrow what a proposition
3799,125-121124-0052.flac,oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson and french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done pardon me count pardon me then i may keep this money yes said danglars
3800,125-121124-0036.flac,as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich
3801,125-121124-0037.flac,if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare
3802,125-121124-0017.flac,so young so rich so beautiful could you have imagined this scene chateau renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract indeed no said chateau renaud did you know her
3803,125-121124-0013.flac,accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army
3804,125-121124-0086.flac,with an energy of action those can alone understand
3805,125-121124-0033.flac,no with a relation but still we have quite lost our dear urgenie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo
3806,125-121124-0021.flac,he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said chateau renaud
3807,125-121124-0055.flac,as if one crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket book but
3808,125-121124-0016.flac,one of them was made of debray chateau renaud and beauchamp poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl
3809,125-121124-0025.flac,and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile well said he extending his hand to monte cristo
3810,125-121124-0035.flac,that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power
3811,125-121124-0084.flac,they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain
3812,125-121124-0070.flac,he has three unlimited credits one on me one on rott child one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of one hundred thousand francs
3813,125-121124-0085.flac,after expressing acute sympathy with the father
3814,125-121124-0076.flac,are you then pressed for this money yes for the examination of our cash takes place to morrow to morrow why did you not tell me so before why it is as good as a century and what hour does the examination take place at two o'clock
3815,125-121124-0010.flac,and presented himself at his cousin's with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required at twelve o'clock the morning coaches rolled into the paved court
3816,125-121124-0045.flac,no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself i am credited on you for six million i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs
3817,125-121124-0083.flac,listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive
3818,125-121124-0073.flac,for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired
3819,125-121124-0069.flac,it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk and he had five million in your hands alone why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob indeed i do not know what he is
3820,125-121124-0071.flac,i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to twenty thousand francs a month it is magnificent
3821,125-121124-0048.flac,if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker's feet
3822,125-121124-0015.flac,and who did not exact a mournful face or forced tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover
3823,125-121124-0049.flac,what he stammered do you mean to keep that money excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning oh well then said monte cristo
3824,125-121124-0006.flac,no said villefort only return again at eleven o'clock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned
3825,125-121124-0050.flac,pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five million without a minute's delay it would have been remarkable but here are your bonds pay me differently
3826,125-121124-0058.flac,i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me
3827,125-121124-0080.flac,that you had a deficiency to make up indeed said the receiver and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be to morrow yes but without fail
3828,125-121124-0024.flac,still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about to night this funeral is the news of the day but hush here comes our minister of justice
3829,125-121124-0061.flac,we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips good morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me
3830,125-121124-0000.flac,danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet
3831,125-121124-0066.flac,that if i draw out ten million on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling come said bouville with a tone of entire incredulity five million to that gentleman who just left
3832,125-121124-0019.flac,the gentleman who receives us is he a deputy oh no i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper
3833,125-121124-0074.flac,upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not much
3834,125-121124-0041.flac,stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million
3835,125-121124-0054.flac,no decidedly no keep my signatures but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seem to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds how absurd
3836,125-121124-0004.flac,grief does not stun me i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto
3837,125-121124-0005.flac,o work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows
3838,125-121124-0027.flac,he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honour i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing
3839,125-121124-0059.flac,who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left the count's sad face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver generale held in his hand
3840,125-121124-0034.flac,family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion
3841,125-121124-0078.flac,take it to rochild or lafitte's and they will take it off your hands at once
3842,125-121342-0032.flac,that's why a good man going wrong attracts people they stand around and literally warm themselves at the calories of virtue he gives off sarah makes an unsophisticated remark and the face simper and delight how innocent the poor child is
3843,125-121342-0000.flac,a fathom deep in sleep i lie with old desires restrained before to clamor lifeward with a cry as dark flies out the graying door and so in quest of creeds to share i seek assertive day again
3844,125-121342-0045.flac,want to go down there and see if it's dirty french rivers all brown or black so were southern rivers twenty four dollars meant four hundred and eighty doughnuts he could live on it three months and sleep in the park wonder where jill was jill bayne fane
3845,125-121342-0019.flac,he thought cynically how completely he was lacking in all human sympathy o henry had found in these people romance pathis love hate amory saw only coarseness physical filth and stupidity he made no self accusations
3846,125-121342-0012.flac,at best just people too hot or too cold tired worried he pictured the rooms where these people lived where the patterns of the blistered wall papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds
3847,125-121342-0047.flac,own taste the best isabel clara rosalind eleanor were all american eleanor would pitch probably south paw rosalind was outfield wonderful hitter clara first base maybe
3848,125-121342-0014.flac,leaving hard brown deposits in the bowl it was not so bad where there were only men or else only women it was when they were villy hurted that it all seemed so rotten it was some shame that women gave off at having men see them tired and poor
3849,125-121342-0042.flac,if it wasn't appendicitis influenza maybe what one hundred and twentieth street
3850,125-121342-0011.flac,the querulous worry as to whether some one isn't leaning on you a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman hating her for it the woman hating him for not doing it at worst a squalid phantasmagoria of breath
3851,125-121342-0008.flac,finally the rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers were at work new york seemed not so much awakening as turning over in its bed pallid men rushed by pinching together their coat collars
3852,125-121342-0027.flac,no i am merely afraid of being poor question very afraid
3853,125-121342-0017.flac,how the smell of it had suddenly cleared the air and given everyone in the car a momentary glow i detest poor people thought amory suddenly i hate them for being poor poverty may have been beautiful once but it's rotten now
3854,125-121342-0048.flac,wonder what humbird's body lookes like now if he himself hadn't been bayonet instructor he'd have gone up to line three months sooner probably been killed where's the darned bell
3855,125-121342-0018.flac,and saing something to his companion with a look of utter disgust probably thought amory what he said was my god aren't people horrible never before in his life had amory considered poor people
3856,125-121342-0024.flac,i can't imagine not being able to
3857,125-121342-0016.flac,and danger it was an atmosphere wherein birth and marriage and death were loanthsome secret things he remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers
3858,125-121342-0001.flac,but old monotony is there endless avenues of rain oh might i rise again might i throw off the heat of that old wine see the new morning mass the sky with fairy towers line on line
3859,125-121342-0020.flac,never any more did he reproach himself for feelings that were natural and sincere he accepted all his reactions as a part of him unchangeable unmoral this problem of poverty transformed magnified attached to some grandeur
3860,125-121342-0007.flac,that depressed him with its heavy odour compounded of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetted sensuousness of stale powder on women after the thick crowd came another scattering a stray half dozen a man on crutches
3861,125-121342-0036.flac,not necessarily question what would be the test of corruption
3862,125-121342-0035.flac,i think so i'm not sure i'm not sure about good and evil at all any more question is that a bad sign in itself
3863,125-121342-0021.flac,more dignified attitude might some day even be his problem at present it roused only his profound distaste he walked over to fifth avenue dodging the blind black menace of umbrellas and standing in front of dulmonico's hailed an autobus
3864,125-121342-0031.flac,none i've no more virtue to lose just as a cooling pot gives off heat so all through youth and adolescence we give off calories of virtue that's what's called ingeniousness question an interesting idea
3865,125-121342-0002.flac,the air became gray an opalescent a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way then another light then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision under his feet a thick iron studded skylight turned yellow
3866,125-121342-0040.flac,two and three look alike no not much seat damp are clothes absorbing wetness from seat or seat absorbing dryness from clothes sitting on wet substance gave appendicitis so froggy parker's mother said well he'd had it
3867,125-121342-0030.flac,rather i don't want to commit moral suicide question have you no interests left
3868,125-121342-0004.flac,the silence of the theatre behind him ended with a curious snapping sound followed by the heavy roaring of a rising crowd and the interlaced clatter of many voices the matinee was over
3869,125-121342-0044.flac,uncle had only paid hundred a month for a whole great big house in minneapolis question were the stairs on the left or right as you came in anyway in twelve unovi they were straight back andto the left what a dirty river
3870,125-121342-0033.flac,they're warming themselves at her virtue but sarah sees the simper and never makes that remark again only she feels a little colder after that question all your calories gone
3871,125-121342-0043.flac,one o two instead of one two seven rosalind not like beatrice eleinor like beatrice only wylder and brainier apartments along here expensive probably hundred and fifty a month maybe two hundred
3872,125-121342-0028.flac,just passively afraid question
3873,125-121342-0039.flac,this dialogue merged grotesquely into his mind's most familiar state a grotesque blending of desires worries exterior impressions and physical reactions one hundred and twenty seventh street or one hundred and thirty seventh street
3874,125-121342-0005.flac,he stood aside edged a little into the rain to let the throng pass a small boy rushed out sniffed in the damp fresh air and turned up the collar of his coat came three or four couples in a great hurry
3875,125-121342-0003.flac,in the street the lamps of the taxi cab sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement the unwelcome november rain had perversely stolen the day's last hour and pawned it with that ancient fence the night
3876,125-121342-0013.flac,and always there was the economical stuffiness of indoor winter and the long summers nightmares of perspiration between sticky enveloping walls dirty restaurants where careless tired people helped themselves to sugar with their own used coffee spoons
3877,125-121342-0034.flac,all of them i'm beginning to warm myself at other people's virtue question are you corrupt
3878,125-121342-0026.flac,i don't know what i'll do nor have i much curiosity to morrow i'm going to leave new york for good it's a bad town unless you're on top of it question do you want a lot of money
3879,125-121342-0010.flac,and the numerous unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in threatening procession there was the ghastly stinking crush of the subway the car cards thrusting themselves at one leering out like dull bors who grab your arm with another story
3880,125-121342-0038.flac,they don't they just want the fun of eating it all over again the matron doesn't want to repeat her girlhood she wants to repeat her honeymoon
3881,125-121342-0037.flac,becoming really insincere calling myself not such a bad fellow thinking i regretted my lost youth when i only envy the delights of loosing it
3882,125-121342-0046.flac,sane what the devil neck hurts darned uncomfortable seat no desire to sleep with jill what could alec see in her
3883,125-121342-0009.flac,a great swarm of tired magpie girls from a department store crowded along with shrieks of strident laughter three to an umbrella a squad of marching policemen passed already miraculously protected by oilskin capes the rain gave amory a feeling of detachment
3884,125-121342-0015.flac,it was some disgust that men had for women who were tired and poor it was dirtier than any battle field he had seen
3885,125-121342-0029.flac,don't ask me question don't you care
3886,125-121342-0023.flac,that i have about twenty four dollars to my name question
3887,125-121342-0025.flac,really the are the only things i can do question be definite
3888,125-121342-0006.flac,came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glance invariably first at the wet street then at the rain filled air finally at the dismal sky last a dense strolling mass
3889,125-121342-0041.flac,i'll see the steamboat company beatrice said and my uncle has a quarter interest did beatrice go to heaven probably not he represented beatrice's immortality also love affairs of numerous dead men who surely had never thought of him
3890,125-121342-0022.flac,somewhere in his mind a conversation began rather resumed its place in his attention it was composed not of two voices but of one which acted alike as questioner an answerer question well what's the situation answer
3891,7059-77897-0027.flac,well i must think about that and i must ask mister wilmington jack she called over her shoulder to the young man at the window do you think your uncle would approve of me as juliet's nurse
3892,7059-77897-0009.flac,the lawn before it sloped down to the road where it ended smoothly at the brink of a neat stone wall a black asphalt path curved from the steps by which you mounted from the street to the steps by which you mounted to the heavy portico
3893,7059-77897-0006.flac,while a long freight train clattered deafeningly by and then drove bumping and jouncing across the tracks i suppose you remember what over the track means in hatboro oh yes said annie with a smile social perdition at the least
3894,7059-77897-0022.flac,but i don't know annie whether i oughtn't to remember my low beginnings i suppose we all like to be consistent answered annie aimlessly uneasily yes missus munger broke in
3895,7059-77897-0029.flac,she added pulling out her watch by its leather guard not till you've had lunch said missus wilmington rising with the ladies you must stay annie i shall not excuse you well
3896,7059-77897-0003.flac,i would rather not see missus wilmington with you on this subject i should be of no use
3897,7059-77897-0016.flac,yes that's what any one would think in the abstract said missus munger now little boy
3898,7059-77897-0030.flac,will you join us jack no i'm going to the office said the nephew bowing himself out of the room jack's learnin to be superintendent said missus wilmington lifting her teasing voice to make him hear her in the hall
3899,7059-77897-0024.flac,very well then exclaimed missus munger we'll drop them as i said to miss kilburn on our way here if missus wilmington is opposed to them we'll drop them oh am i such an
3900,7059-77897-0005.flac,cowed in trouble by the affair that doesn't make the slightest difference said missus munger impartially all you will have to do is to keep still i will put the case to her she checked the pony before the bar which the flagman at the railroad crossing had let down
3901,7059-77897-0010.flac,before the massive black walnut doors the ladies were shown into the music room from which the notes of a piano were sounding when they rang and missus wilmington rose from the instrument to meet them a young man who had been standing beside her turned away
3902,7059-77897-0002.flac,it throws a new light on it and if that's the way nice people are going to look at it why we must give up the idea i'm quite prepared to do so but i want to see missus wilmington first missus munger said annie uneasily
3903,7059-77897-0018.flac,i used to be one of the hands myself yes annie there was a time after you went away and after father died when i actually fell so low as to work for an honest living i think i heard lyra said annie
3904,7059-77897-0011.flac,missus wilmington was dressed in a light morning dress with a wateau fall whose delicate russets and faded reds and yellows heightened the richness of her complexion and hair why annie she said how glad i am to see you
3905,7059-77897-0012.flac,and you too missus munger how very nice her words took value from the thick mellow tones of her voice and passed for much more than they were worth intrinsically
3906,7059-77897-0020.flac,and there's no use trying to deny it as mister putney says he and i have our record and we don't have to make any pretences and the question is whether i ought to go back on my fellow hands oh
3907,7059-77897-0001.flac,and that is the reason i spoke to him but i meant the other gentlemen you saw how they took it i saw that they both made fun of it said annie yes that's just the point
3908,7059-77897-0019.flac,but i had forgotten the fact in connection with what had been said made her still more uncomfortable well i didn't work very hard and i didn't have to work long but i was a hand
3909,7059-77897-0017.flac,putting out a silencing hand in the direction of the young man don't you be so fast you let your auntie speak for herself i don't know about not letting the hands stay to the dance and supper missus munger you know i might feel put upon
3910,7059-77897-0007.flac,yes it isn't so bad as it used to be socially mister wilmington has built a very fine house on this side and there are several pretty queen anne cottages going up they drove along under the elms which here stood somewhat at random about the wide grasses street
3911,7059-77897-0000.flac,oh no i don't care anything about him said missus munger touching her pony with the tip of her whiplash he's an odious little creature and i knew that he would go for the dance and supper because mister peck was opposed to them he's one of the anti peck party in his church
3912,7059-77897-0025.flac,influential person said missus wilmington with a shrug it's rather awful isn't it annie not at all missus munger answered for annie we've just been talking the matter over with mister putney and doctor morrel
3913,7059-77897-0031.flac,and he's been spendin the whole mornin here in the richly appointed dining room a glitter of china and glass and a mass of carven oak the table was laid for two put another plate norah
3914,7059-77897-0008.flac,between the high windowy bulks of the shoe shops and hat shops the dust gradually freed itself from the cinders about the tracks and it hardened into a handsome newly made road beyond the houses of the shop hands
3915,7059-77897-0014.flac,mister wilmington and missus munger are old friends the young fellow bowed silently and annie instantly took a dislike to him his heavy jaw long eyes and low forehead almost hidden under a thick bang he sat down cornerwise on a chair
3916,7059-77897-0021.flac,but missus wilmington said missus munger with intense deprecation that's such a very different thing you were not brought up to it it was just temporary and besides and besides
3917,7059-77897-0013.flac,we had the furnace lighted yesterday and we've been in all the morning and so we hadn't noticed jack won't you shut the register she drawled over her shoulder this is my nephew mister jack wilmington miss kilburn
3918,7059-77897-0032.flac,said missus wilmington carelessly
3919,7059-77897-0015.flac,and having previously committed missus wilmington in favour of the general scheme asked her what she thought of that part mister jack wilmington answered for her i should think you had a right to do what you please about it it's none of the hands business if you don't choose to ask them
3920,7059-77897-0028.flac,you'd better ask him growled the young fellow well said missus wilmington with another laugh i'll thank it over missus munger thank you said missus munger and now we must really be going
3921,7059-77897-0026.flac,and they're both opposed you're merely the straw that breaks the camels back missus wilmington oh thank you that's a great relief
3922,7059-77897-0004.flac,and she laid her arm across annie's lap as if to prevent her jumping out of the phaeton as missus wilmington's old friend you will have the greatest influence with her but i don't know that i wish to influence her in favour of the supper and dance i don't know that i believe in them said annie
3923,7059-77897-0023.flac,but i guess i must oppose the little invited dance and supper on principle we all like to be consistent as annie says even if we're inconsistent in the attempt she added with a laugh
3924,7059-77900-0018.flac,with the habit he had of touching it there with the tip of his tongue made annie think of a cat that had been at the cream i've been hoping to call with missus wilmington to pay my respects but i've been away a great deal this season and and
3925,7059-77900-0028.flac,it was a relief to get away from it all into the room cool and quiet where half a dozen neat girls were counting and stamping the stockings with different numbers here's where i used to work said lyra
3926,7059-77900-0030.flac,i don't well they're not dreams exactly annie when all's said and done for them when they left the mill she asked annie to come home to tea with her saying
3927,7059-77900-0031.flac,as if from a perception of her dislike for the young fellow that jack was going to boston they had a long evening together after mister wilmington took himself off after tea to his study as he called it
3928,7059-77900-0024.flac,the tireless machines marched back and forth across the floor and the men who watched them with suicidal intensity ran after them barefooted when they made off with a broken thread spliced it and then escaped from them to their stations again
3929,7059-77900-0025.flac,they looked after lyra and her nephew from under cotton frowsed bangs they all seemed to know her and returned her easy kindly greetings with an effect of liking
3930,7059-77900-0006.flac,i've just got my new phaeton and i drove up at once to crush you with it isn't it a beauty you're too late lyra said annie i've just come from the northwicks and another crushing beauty has got in ahead of your phaeton
3931,7059-77900-0009.flac,i want you to take a drive with me and try my new phaeton said lyra coming out annie now looked at it with that irresolution of hers and lyra commanded get right in
3932,7059-77900-0027.flac,except when jack wilmington curtly ordered them to do this or that in illustration of some point he was explaining she wearied herself as people do in such places in expressing her wonder at the ingenuity of the machinery
3933,7059-77900-0021.flac,i'll go with you with great pleasure ah he bustled about putting the things together on his table and then reaching for the panama hat on a hook behind it there was something pathetic in his eagerness to do what lyra bade him
3934,7059-77900-0001.flac,which her physical delicacy awakened she asked her how she ever came to take up the social union and answered for her that of course it had the attraction of the theatricals and went on to talk of her sister's part in them
3935,7059-77900-0036.flac,she said she studied music a little and confessed that she read a good deal novels mostly though the library was handsomely equipped with well bound general literature at moments it all seemed no harm
3936,7059-77900-0007.flac,oh poor annie lyra began to laugh with agreeable intelligence do come in and tell me about it why is that girl going to take part in the theatricals she doesn't care to please anyone does she
3937,7059-77900-0008.flac,do you mean it lyra demanded annie arrested on her threshold by the charm of this improbability well i don't know they're opposites but upon second thoughts you needn't come in annie
3938,7059-77900-0040.flac,oh then said annie perhaps he accounts for her playing juliet
3939,7059-77900-0017.flac,where her husband sat writing at a table george i want to introduce you to miss kilburn
3940,7059-77900-0032.flac,and remained shut in there annie was uneasily aware of him from time to time but lyra had apparently no more disturbance from his absence than from his presence which he had managed with a frank acceptance of everything it suggested
3941,7059-77900-0005.flac,and missus wilmington put her head out of the open parlour window howd'you do annie she drawled in her tender voice won't you come in you see i'm in possession
3942,7059-77900-0012.flac,we'll just go round there and kill two birds with one stone i ought to show off my new phaeton to mister wilmington first of all he gave it to me it would be kind of conjugal or filial or something
3943,7059-77900-0039.flac,ought to be tacit or explicit in the kissing and embrace between romeo and juliet
3944,7059-77900-0013.flac,you know mister wilmington and i are not exactly contemporaries annie i heard he was somewhat your senior said annie reluctantly lyra laughed
3945,7059-77900-0016.flac,and finding its first apartment empty
3946,7059-77900-0010.flac,we'll go down to the wolks you've never met my husband yet have you annie no i haven't lyra i've always just missed him somehow he seems to have been perpetually just gone to town or not got back well
3947,7059-77900-0029.flac,and here's where i first met mister wilmington the place is full of romantic associations the stockings are all one size annie
3948,7059-77900-0000.flac,miss northwick called upon annie during the week with excuses for her delay and for coming alone she seemed to have intentions of being polite but she constantly betrayed her want of interest in annie and disappointed an expectation of refinement
3949,7059-77900-0034.flac,annie said she thought she would at least like to go to the seaside somewhere during the summer but no lyra said it would be too much trouble and you know annie i always did hate trouble
3950,7059-77900-0042.flac,annie lay awake a long time that night she was sure that she ought not to like lyra if she did not approve of her and that she ought not to have gone home to tea with her and spent the evening with her unless she fully respected her
3951,7059-77900-0026.flac,from time to time at lyra's bidding the young fellow explained to annie some curious feature of the processes
3952,7059-77900-0011.flac,he's really at home now and i don't mean at the house which isn't home to him but the works you've never seen the works either have you no i haven't well then
3953,7059-77900-0041.flac,oh it's at the rehearsals you know that the fun is
3954,7059-77900-0019.flac,we'rve all very happy to have you home again miss kilburn i've often heard my wife speak of your old days together at hatboro they fenced with some polite fence of interest in each other the old man standing beside his writing table
3955,7059-77900-0038.flac,with te superfluity which it involved no self denial to give from but mister peck had given her a point of view and though she believed she did not agree with him she could not escape from it
3956,7059-77900-0023.flac,and the first room was like what annie had seen before in cotton factories with a faint smell of oil from the machinery and a fine snow of fluff in the air and catching to the whitewashed walls and the foul window sashes
3957,7059-77900-0003.flac,she met the younger sister whom she found a great beauty she seemed very cold and of a hauteur which she subdued with difficulty but she was more consecutively polite than her sister and annie watched with fascination her turns of the head
3958,7059-77900-0022.flac,i'll show them through he said to his uncle and the old man assented with well perhaps you'd better jack and went back to his room the wilmington stocking mills spun their own threads
3959,7059-77900-0037.flac,at others the luxury in which this life was so contentedly sunk oppressed annie like a thick close air yet she knew that lyra was kind to many of the poor people about her and did a great deal of good as the phrase is
3960,7059-77900-0020.flac,and stayined himself with a shaking hand upon it lyra interrupted them well i think now that annie is here we'd better not let her get away without showing her the works oh oh decidedly
3961,7059-77900-0004.flac,her movements of leopard swiftness and elasticity the changing lights of her complexion the curve of her fine lips the fluttering of her thin nostrils a very new basket phaeton stood glittering at annie's door when she got home
3962,7059-77900-0014.flac,they came round into the region of the shops and lyra checked her pony in front of her husband's factory it was not imposingly large but as missus wilmington caused annie to observe it was as big as the hat shops and as ugly as the shoe shops
3963,7059-77900-0015.flac,the structure trembled with the operation of its industry and as they mounted the wooden steps to the open outside door an inner door swung ajar for a moment and let out a roar mingled with the hum and whirl
3964,7059-77900-0033.flac,she talked freely of her marriage not as if it were like others but for what it was she showed annie over the house and she ended with a display of the rich dresses which he was always buying her and which she never wore because she never went anywhere
3965,7059-77900-0035.flac,and i don't want to be poked into a hotel so i stay in hatboro she said that she had always been a village girl and did not miss the interests of a larger life as she caught glimpses of them in south hatboro or want the bother of them
3966,7059-77900-0002.flac,the relation of the northwick family to the coming entertainment and an impression of frail modeled wrists and high thin cheeks and an absence of modelling under a fluent drapery was the main effect of miss northwick's visit when annie returned it
3967,7059-88364-0030.flac,grow up models for all the world of plant arrangement and tree luxury our mechanical east is reproved our tension is relaxed our ugliness is challenged every time we look upon those garden paths and forest
3968,7059-88364-0012.flac,yet there is a difference the present day man in the street man about town california has an obvious magnificence about him that is allied to the eucalyptus tree the pomegranate california is a gilded state
3969,7059-88364-0005.flac,already the california sort in the commercial channels has become the broadly accepted if mediocre national form people who revere the pilgrim fathers of sixteen twenty
3970,7059-88364-0031.flac,it is possible for los angeles to lay hold of the motion picture as our national text book in art as boston appropriated to herself the guardianship of the national text books of literature
3971,7059-88364-0018.flac,part of the thinness of california is not only its youth but the result of the physical fact that the human race is there spread over so many acres of land they try not only to count their minds and enumerate their palm trees
3972,7059-88364-0025.flac,through all four seasons fairy beauty overwhelms the lumbering grandstand players the tiniest garden is a jewelled pathway of wonder but the californian cannot shout
3973,7059-88364-0022.flac,they will be a different set of virtues from those of new england there is no more natural place for the scattering of confeti than this state except the moving picture scene itself both have a genius for gardens and dancing and carnival
3974,7059-88364-0020.flac,they shout their statistics across the rockies and the deserts to new york the mississippi valley is non existent to the californian his fellow feeling is for the opposite coast line
3975,7059-88364-0006.flac,have often wished those gentlemen had moored their bark in the region of los angeles rather than plymouth rock that boston had been founded there at last that landing is achieved
3976,7059-88364-0017.flac,as the shadow it throws upon the screen this newness california has in common with all photoplays it is thrillingly possible for the state and the art to acquire spiritual tradition and depth together
3977,7059-88364-0007.flac,patriotic art students have discussed with mingled irony and admiration the boston domination of the only american culture of the nineteenth century namely literature indianapolis has had her day since then
3978,7059-88364-0009.flac,but are also grounded in the honest hope of a healthy rivalry they want new romanticists and artists as indigenous to their soil as was hawthorn to witch haunted salem or longfellow to the chestnuts of his native heath
3979,7059-88364-0001.flac,with much slap you on the back personal gossip this is the outgrowth of the fact that every type of the photoplay but the intimate is founded on some phase of the out of doors being thus dependent
3980,7059-88364-0033.flac,the dean of american singers clark ashton smith the young star treader george sterling that son of ancient merlin have in their songs the seeds of better sonarios than california has sent us
3981,7059-88364-0004.flac,as they should be california indeed stands a chance to achieve through the films and utterance of her own will this land furthest west be the first to capture the inner spirit of this newest and most curious of the arts
3982,7059-88364-0008.flac,chicago is lifting her head nevertheless boston still controls the text book in english and dominates our high schools ironic feelings in this matter on the part of western men are based somewhat on envy and illegitimate cussedness
3983,7059-88364-0026.flac,orange blossoms orange blossoms heliotrope heliotrope he cannot boom forth rose leaves rose leaves so that he does their beauties justice
3984,7059-88364-0010.flac,whatever may be said of the patriarchs from oliver wendell holmes to amos bronson alcott they were true sons of the new england stone fences and meeting houses they could not have been born or nurtured anywhere else on the face of the earth
3985,7059-88364-0034.flac,there are two poems by george sterling that i have had in mind for many a day as conceptions that should inspire mystic films akin to them these poems are the night senturies and
3986,7059-88364-0029.flac,than the aisles of the romanesque namely the groves of the giant red woods the campaign for a beautiful nation could very well emanate from the west coast where with the slightest care
3987,7059-88364-0014.flac,the hue of the golden gate that opens the sunset way to mystic and terrible catha and hindustan the enemy of california says the state is magnificent but thin
3988,7059-88364-0023.flac,when the californian relegates the dramatic to secondary scenes both in his life and his photoplay and turns to the genuinely epic and lyric
3989,7059-88364-0000.flac,around los angeles the greatest and most characteristic moving picture colonies are being built each photoplay magazine has its california letter telling of the putting up of new studios and the transfer of actors
3990,7059-88364-0024.flac,he and this instrument may find their immortality together as new england found its soul in the essays of emerson
3991,7059-88364-0028.flac,the california photoplay wright can base his crowd picture upon the city worshipping mobs of san francisco he can derive his patriotic and religious splendors from something older and more magnificent
3992,7059-88364-0016.flac,he says the citizens of this state lack the richness of an aesthetic and religious tradition he says there is no substitute for time but even these things make for coincidence
3993,7059-88364-0027.flac,here is where the photoplay can begin to give him a more delicate utterance and he can go on into stranger things and evolve all the splendor films into higher types for the very name of california is splendor
3994,7059-88364-0003.flac,but for a description of california ask any traveller or study the background of almost any photoplay if the photoplay is the consistent utterance of its scenes if the actors are incarnations of the land they walk upon
3995,7059-88364-0019.flac,but they count the miles of their sea coast and the acres under cultivation and the height of the peaks and revel in large statistics and the bigness generally and forget how a few men rattle around in a great deal of scenery
3996,7059-88364-0011.flac,some of us view with the peculiar thrill the prospect that los angeles may become the boston of the photoplay perhaps it would be better to say the florence because california reminds one
3997,7059-88364-0015.flac,he declares it is as though it were painted on a brobdynagian piece of gilt paper and he who dampens his finger and thrusts it through finds an alkaly valley on the other side the lonely prickly peair and a heap of ashes from a deserted camp fire
3998,7059-88364-0013.flac,it has not the sordidness of gold as has wall street but it is the embodiment of the natural ore that the ragged prospector finds the gold of california is the color of the orange the glitter of dawn in the yosemite
3999,7059-88364-0021.flac,through the geographical accident of separation by mountain and desert from the rest of the country he becomes a mere shouter hurrahing so assiduously that all variety in the voice is lost
4000,7059-88364-0032.flac,if california has a shining soul and not merely a golden body let her forget her seventeen year old melodramatics and turn her poets who understand the heart underneath the glory edwin markham
4001,7059-88364-0002.flac,the plant can best be set up where there is no winter besides this the los angeles region has the sea the mountains the desert and many kinds of grove and field landscape and architecture are sub tropical
4002,1737-142396-0011.flac,i trust he is a bishop by this time he had all the necessary qualifications as we knew these strange folk had visitors sometimes stiff and colorless olympians like themselves equally without vital interests and intelligent pursuits
4003,1737-142396-0003.flac,they were free to issue forth and buy gunpowder in the full eye of the sun free to fire cannons and explode mines on the lawn yet they never did any one of these things no irresistible energy hailed them to church of sundays
4004,1737-142396-0020.flac,but was the matter allowed to end there i trow not again when harold was locked up in his room all day for assalt and battery upon a neighbour's pig an action he would have scorned being indeed on the friendliest terms with the porker in question
4005,1737-142396-0009.flac,he neither laughed nor sneered as the olympians would have done but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion
4006,1737-142396-0006.flac,a place elf haunted wonderful simply produce so many apples and cherries or it didn't when the failures of nature were not infrequently ascribed to us
4007,1737-142396-0018.flac,than the kindly beasts who shared our natural existence in the sun the estrangement was fortified by an abiding sense of injustice
4008,1737-142396-0023.flac,a saddening doubt a dull suspicion creeps over me et in arcadia ego
4009,1737-142396-0022.flac,well the olympians are all past and gone somehow the sun does not seem to shine so brightly as it used the trackless meadows of old time have shrunk and dwindled away to a few poor acres
4010,1737-142396-0016.flac,under the delusion that these pale phantasms of reality were among the importances of life we illuminati eating silently our heads full of plans and conspiracies could have told them what real life was
4011,1737-142396-0004.flac,yet they went there regularly of their own accord though they betrayed no greater delight in the experience than ourselves on the whole the existence of these olympians seemed to be entirely void of interests
4012,1737-142396-0002.flac,but only a certain blend of envy of their good luck and pity for their inability to make use of it indeed it was one of the most hopeless features in their character when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them which wasn't often
4013,1737-142396-0019.flac,or admit themselves in the wrong or to accept similar concessions on our part for instance when i flung the cat out of an upper window though i did it from no ill feeling and it didn't hurt the cat
4014,1737-142396-0021.flac,there was no handsome expression of regret on the discovery of the real culprit what harold had felt was not so much the imprisonment indeed he had very soon escaped by the window with assistance from his allies and had only gone back in time for his release as the olympian habit
4015,1737-142396-0010.flac,then too he was always ready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding indians on the shortest possible notice in brief a distinctly able man with talents so far as we could judge immensely above the majority
4016,1737-142396-0017.flac,we had just left it outside and were all on fire to get back to it of course we didn't waste the revelation on them the futility of imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated one in thought and purpose linked by the necessity of combating one hostile fate
4017,1737-142396-0013.flac,silently submitting as was our wont with more contempt than anger anon with unctuous hair and faces stiffened in a conventional grin
4018,1737-142396-0012.flac,emerging out of the clouds and passing away again to drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our ken then brute force was pitilessly applied we were captured washed and forced into clean collars
4019,1737-142396-0008.flac,there was an exception in the curate who would receive unblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo which it was our delight moccasined and tomahawked to ride down with those whoops that announce the scenting of blood
4020,1737-142396-0000.flac,i can see now that to children with a proper equipment of parents these things would have worn a different aspect but to those whose nearest were aunts and uncles a special attitude of mine may be allowed they treated us indeed with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh
4021,1737-142396-0007.flac,though the whole place swarmed with such portancs they cared not about exploring for robbers caves nor digging for hidden treasure perhaps indeed it was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of their time stuffily indoors
4022,1737-142396-0014.flac,how could reasonable people spend their precious time so
4023,1737-142396-0015.flac,or to hunt bears among the hazels it was incessant matter for amazement how these olympians would talk over our heads during meals for instance of this or the other social or political inanity
4024,1737-142396-0005.flac,even as their movements were confined and slow and their habits stereotyped and senseless to anything but appearances they were blind
4025,1737-142396-0001.flac,while there grew up in me as in the parallel case of calibon upon cetibos a vague sense of a ruling power wilful and freakish and prone to the practice of vagaries just choosing so

4044,1737-142397-0020.flac,i ran sideways shouting i dug glad heels into the squulching soil i splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick i hurled clod skywards at random and presently i somehow found myself singing
4045,1737-142397-0037.flac,i seemed to discern faintly a something of the stern meaning in her valorous chant my invisible companion was singing also and seemed at times to be chuckling softly to himself doubtless at thought of the strange new lessons he was teaching me
4046,1737-142397-0029.flac,and presently i came within sight of the village church sitting solitary within its circle of elms from forth the vestry window projected two small legs gyrading hungry for foothold with larceny
4047,1737-142397-0023.flac,a belated truant you have dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale expressionless moon for company to day why not i the trickster the hypocrite i who whip round corners and bluster relapse and evade then rally in pursue
4048,1737-142397-0016.flac,at each step growing less charlotte the mummer of a minute and more the anxious pilgrim of all time the lion's wrath waxed terrible at her approach his roaring filled the startled air
4049,1737-142397-0006.flac,always stuck staunchly to a new fad till he had worn it quite out just at present he was a muffin man
4050,1737-142397-0008.flac,to pass along busy streets of your own building for ever ringing an imaginary bell and offering airy muffins of your own make to a bustling thronging crowd of your own creation there were points about the game it cannot be denied though it seemed scarce in harmony with this radiant windswept morning
4051,1737-142397-0005.flac,oh he's just plain muffin man as usual said charlotte with petulance fancy wanting to be a muffin man on a whole holiday it was a strange craze certainly but harold who invented his own games and played them without assistance
4052,1737-142397-0038.flac,perhaps too at a special bit of waggishness he had still in store for when at last he grew weary of such insignificant earth bound company he deserted me at a certain spot i knew then dropped subsided and slunk away into nothingness
4053,1737-142397-0010.flac,but i could not help feeling that on this day of days even a grizzly felt misplaced and common sure enough an undeniable bear sprang out on us as we dropped into the road then ensued shrieks growlings revolver shots and unrecorded heroisms
4054,1737-142397-0040.flac,had i been an infant stern here as a grand chance for sentimental output as things were i could only hurry homewards my moral tail well between my legs with an uneasy feeling as i glanced back over my shoulder that there was more in this chance than met the eye
4055,1737-142397-0022.flac,recognized and accepted it without a flicker of dessent all the time the hearty wind was calling to me companionably from where he swung and bellowed in the tree tops
4056,1737-142397-0025.flac,so we sheered off together arm in arm so to speak and with fullest confidence i took the jigging thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me a whimsical comrade i found him ere he had done with me
4057,1737-142397-0017.flac,into the vacant meadow spaces
4058,1737-142397-0042.flac,by the back door he had rendered up his duck weed bedabbled person into the hands of an aunt and had been promptly sent off to bed and this on a holiday was very much
4059,1737-142397-0012.flac,do shouted edward valiantly i should i should i should
4060,1737-142397-0032.flac,and i felt sure as i rambled off in his wake that he had more holiday matter to show me and so indeed he had and all of it was to the same lawless tune like a black pirate flag on the blue ocean of air a hawk hung ominous then plumbet wise dropped to the hedgerow
4061,1737-142397-0019.flac,the pant and smoke of a distant train all were wine or song was it or odour this unity they all blended into i had no words then to describe it that earth effluence of which i was so conscious nor indeed have i found words since
4062,1737-142397-0007.flac,and offering phantom muffins to invisible wayfarers
4063,1737-142397-0039.flac,stood the ancient whipping post of the village its sides fretted with the initials of a generation that scorned its mute lesson but still clipped by the stout rusty shackles that had tethered the wrists
4064,1737-142397-0034.flac,to her who took no sides there was every bit as much to be said for the hawk as for the chaffinch both were her children and she would show no preferences further on a hedgehog lay dead athwart the path nay more than dead decadent distinctly
4065,1737-142397-0035.flac,a sorry sight for one that had known the fellow and more bustling circumstances nature might at least have paused to shed one tear over this rough jacketed little son of hers for his wasted aims his cancelled ambitions his whole career of usefulness cut suddenly short but not a bit of it
4066,1737-142397-0011.flac,and the age of acorns would have displaced our hard won civilization
4067,1737-142397-0002.flac,some one of us had had presents and pretty conventional speeches and had glowed with that sense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to deserve it but the holiday was for all the rapture of awakening nature for all
4068,1737-142397-0041.flac,harold it further appeared greatly coveting tadpoles and topheavy with the eagerness of possession had fallen into the pond this in itself was nothing but on attempting to sneak in
4069,1737-142397-0013.flac,he beat the unicorn observed harold dubiously all around the town that proves he was a good lion cried edward triumphantly but the question is how were you to tell em when you see em i should ask martha said harold of the simple creed
4070,1737-142397-0026.flac,silent face to face eer a discreet unwinking style as a rule this sort of thing struck me as the most pitiful tom foolery two calves rubbing noses through a gate were natural and right and within the order of things but that human beings
4071,1737-142397-0028.flac,and it was with a certain surprise that i found myself regarding these fatuous ones with kindliness instead of contempt as i rambled by unheeded of them there was indeed some reconciling influence abroad which could bring the like antics into harmony with bud and growth and the frolic air
4072,1737-142397-0004.flac,flashed the colour back true and brilliant and the soft air thrilled with the germinating touch that seemed to kindle something in my own small person as well as in the rash primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts out into the brimming sun bathed world i sped free of lessons
4073,1737-142397-0015.flac,no i won't i swear i won't protested edward i'll be quite a new lion this time something you can't even imagine and he raced off to his post charlotte hesitated then she went timidly on
4074,1737-142397-0001.flac,it was one of the first awakenings of the year the earth stretched herself smiling in her sleep and everything leapt and pulsed to the stir of the giant's movement with us it was a whole holiday the occasion a birthday it matters not whose
4075,1737-142397-0021.flac,a weary unrhythmic thing of rise and fall and yet it seemed to me a genuine utterance and just at that moment the one thing fitting and right and perfect humanity would have rejected it with scorn nature everywhere singing in the same key
4076,1737-142397-0018.flac,but the passion and the call of the divine morning were high in my blood earth to earth that was the frank note the joyous summons of the day and they could not but jar and seem artificial these human discussions and pretences
4077,1737-142397-0024.flac,i can lead you the best and rarest dance of any for i am the strong capricious one the lord of misrule and i alone am irresponsible and unprincipled and obey no law and for me i was ready enough to fall in with the fellow's humour was not this a whole holiday
4078,1737-142397-0003.flac,the various outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedgebreaking for all colt like i ran through the meadows frisking happy heels in the face of nature laughing responsive above the sky was bluest of the blue wide pools left by the winter's floods
4079,1737-142397-0009.flac,only you mustn't say i told you cause it's to be a surprise all right i said magnanimously
4080,1737-142397-0036.flac,jubilant as ever her song went babbling on and death in life and again life in death were its alternate burdens and looking around and seeing the sheep nibbled heels of turnips that dotted the ground their hearts eaten out of them in frost bound days now over and done
4081,1737-142397-0031.flac,then i passed on my way i protest i was not on bill's side but then neither was i on the vicar's
4082,1737-142397-0027.flac,with salient interests and active pursuits beckoning them on from every side could thus
4083,1737-142397-0033.flac,whence there rose thin and shrill a piteous voice of squealing by the time i got there a whisk of feathers on the turf like scattered play bills was all that remained to tell of the tragedy just enacted yet nature smiled and sang on pitiless gay impartial
4084,1737-142397-0000.flac,the masterful wind was up and out shouting and chasing the lord of the morning poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring swish dead leaves sprang aloft and whirled into space and all the clear swept heaven seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp
4085,1737-142397-0030.flac,bill's coveted booty too i could easily guess at that it came from the vicar's store of biscuits kept as i knew
4086,1737-142397-0014.flac,and i'll run on to that corner and be a lion
4087,1737-148989-0027.flac,and frost pinched the toes that patiently trudged in old boots no debts burdened him the year of absence was nearly over and if he chose to stay herbergman had hopes for him that would bring independence for a time at least
4088,1737-148989-0038.flac,when he thought of it dan felt as if he could not wait but must burst that narrow cell and fly away as the catis worms he used to watch by the brookside shed their stony coffins to climb the ferns and soar into the sky night after night he lulled himself to sleep with planning howl

4279,4406-16882-0054.flac,this was a sweet cordial to me when i was ready to faint many and many a time have i sat down and wept sweetly over the scripture at this place we continued about four days the fifth remove
4280,4406-16882-0055.flac,and then they made a stop and chose some of their stoutest men and sent them back to hold the english army in play whilst the rest escaped and then like jehu they marched on furiously with their old and with their young some carried their old decrepit mothers
4281,4406-16882-0063.flac,they were many hundreds old and young some sick and some lame many had papooses at their backs the greatest number at this time with us were squaws
4282,4406-16882-0067.flac,though there were none but our own company the indians were as thick as the trees it seemed as if there had been a thousand hatchets going at once if one looked before one there was nothing but indians and behind one nothing but indians
4283,4406-16882-0051.flac,as long as they pleased they knocked her on head and the child in her arms with her when they had done that they made a fire and put them both into it
4284,4406-16882-0007.flac,o the doleful sight that now was to behold at this house come behold the works of the lord
4285,4406-16882-0032.flac,when i came i asked them what they had done with it and they told me it was upon the hill
4286,4406-16882-0046.flac,they being to go one way and i another i asked them whether they were earnest with god for deliverance they told me they did as they were able and it was some comfort to me that the lord stirred up children to look to him
4287,4406-16882-0038.flac,i had not seen him before since the destruction of the town and i knew not where he was till i was informed by himself that he was amongst a smaller parcel of indians whose place was about six miles off with tears in his eyes he asked me whether his sister sarah was dead
4288,4406-16882-0023.flac,by a little fire and a few boughs behind me with my sick child in my lap
4289,4406-16882-0030.flac,by my master in this writing must be understood quinnipin who was a sagamore and married king philip's wife's sister not that he first took me but i was sold to him by another naragoncett indian who took me when first i came out of the garrison
4290,4406-16882-0024.flac,my own wound also growing so stiff that i could scarce sit down or rise up yet so it must be that i must sit all this cold winter night upon the cold snowy ground with my sick child in my arms
4291,4406-16882-0043.flac,i cannot but take notice of the wonderful mercy of god to me in those afflictions in sending me a bible one of the indians that came from medfield fight had brought some plunder came to me and asked me if i would have a bible he had got one in his basket
4292,4406-16882-0022.flac,at which they like inhumane creatures laughed and rejoiced to see it though i thought we should there have ended our days as overcome with so many difficulties but the lord renewed my strength still and carried me along that i might see more of his power
4293,4406-16882-0040.flac,all the company for those that belonged to the other small company came through the town that now we were at but before they came to us oh the outrageous roaring and whooping that there was they began their din about a mile before they came to us
4294,4406-16882-0048.flac,and another child in her arms two years old and bad rivers there were to go over and we were feeble with our poor and coarse entertainment i had my bible with me i pulled it out and asked her whether she would read
4295,4406-16882-0028.flac,my wounds stink and are corrupt i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long i sat much alone with a poor wounded child in my lap which moaned night and day having nothing to revive the body or cheer the spirits of her but instead of that
4296,4406-16882-0036.flac,and ye will take benjamin also all these things are against me
4297,4406-16882-0002.flac,in or near the throat fell down dead whereat the indians scornfully shouted and hallowed and were presently upon him stripping off his clothes the bullets flying thick one went through my side and the same as would seem
4298,4406-16882-0037.flac,and as i was going along my heart was even overwhelmed with the thoughts of my condition and that i should have children and a nation which i knew not ruled over them whereupon i earnestly entreated the lord that he would consider my low estate and show me a token for good and if it were his blessed will
4299,4406-16882-0009.flac,as if they would have torn our very hearts out yet the lord by his almighty power preserved a number of us from death for there were twenty four of us taken alive and carried captive i had often before this said that if the indians should come
4300,4406-16882-0018.flac,by one eyed john and marlborough's praying indians which captain mosely brought to boston as the indians told me the second remove but now the next morning i must turn my back upon the town and travel with them into the vast and desolate wilderness
4301,4406-16882-0031.flac,there was no resisting but go i must and leave it when i had been at my master's wigwam
4302,4406-16882-0012.flac,with our bodies wounded and bleeding and our hearts no less than our bodies about a mile we went that night up upon a hill within sight of the town where they intended to lodge there was hard by a vancant house deserted by the english before for fear of the indians
4303,4406-16882-0029.flac,in this miserable condition without any refreshing of one nature or other except a little cold water i cannot but take notice how at another time i could not bear to be in the room where any dead person was
4304,4406-16882-0019.flac,i knew not whither it is not my tongue or pen can express the sorrows of my heart and bitterness of my spirit that i had at this departure but god was with me in a wonderful manner carrying me along and bearing up my spirit
4305,4406-16882-0014.flac,some roasting some lying and burning and some boiling to feed our merciless enemies who were joyful enough though we were disconsolate
4306,4406-16882-0045.flac,some one way and some another there were now besides myself nine english captives in this place all of them children except one woman
4307,4406-16882-0021.flac,and carried it in my arms till my strength failed and i fell down with it then they set me upon a horse with my wounded child in my lap and there being no furniture upon the horse's back as we were going down a steep hill we both fell over the horse's head
4308,4406-16882-0050.flac,she would be often asking the indians to let her go home they not being willing to that and yet vexed with her importunity gathered a great company together about her and stripped her naked and set her in the midst of them and when they had sung and danced about her in their hellish manner
4309,4406-16882-0034.flac,god having taken away this dear child i went to see my daughter mary who was at this same indian town at a wigwam not very far off
4310,4406-16882-0000.flac,belonging to our garrison but none of them would stir though another time if any indian had come to the door they were ready to fly upon him and tear him down the lord hereby would make tus the more acknowledge his hand and to see that our help is always in him
4311,4406-16882-0001.flac,but out we must go the fire increasing and coming along behind us roaring and the indians gaping before us with their guns spears and hatchets to devour us
4312,4406-16882-0010.flac,i should choose rather to be killed by them than taken alive but when it came to the trial my mind changed their glittering weapons so daunted my spirit that i chose rather to go along with those as i may say ravenous beasts
4313,4406-16882-0035.flac,she was about ten years old and taken from the door at first by a praying indian and afterwards sold for a gun
4314,4406-16882-0013.flac,i asked them whether i might not lodge in the house that night to which they answered what will you love englishmen still this was the dolefullest night that ever my eyes saw oh the roaring and singing and dancing and yelling of those black creatures in the night
4315,4406-16882-0044.flac,and turn all those curses upon our enemies i do not desire to live to forget this scripture and what comfort it was to me now
4316,4406-16882-0042.flac,and every time that the other went over their number these at home gave a shout that the very earth rung again and thus they continued till those that had been upon the expedition wwere come up to the sagamore's wigwam and then
4317,4406-16882-0003.flac,through the bowels and hand of my dear child in my arms one of my elder sister's children named william had then his leg broken which the indians perceiving they knocked him on his head
4318,4406-16882-0026.flac,one of the indians got up upon a horse and they set me up behind him with my poor sick babe in my lap a very wearisome and tedious day i had of it what with my own wound and my child's being so exceedingly sick and in a lamentable condition with her wound
4319,4406-16882-0033.flac,and there they told me they had buried it
4320,4406-16882-0027.flac,this day in the afternoon about an hour by sun
4321,4406-16882-0049.flac,be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord the fourth remove and now i must part with that little company i had
4322,4406-16882-0025.flac,and we were both alive to see the light of the next morning the third remove
4323,4406-16882-0004.flac,standing amazed with the blood running down to our heels my eldest sister being yet in the house and seeing those woeful sights the infidels hauling mothers one way and children another and some wallowing in their blood
4324,4406-16882-0047.flac,i wished her not to run away by any means for we were near thirty miles from any english town
4325,4406-16882-0005.flac,and her elder son telling her that her son william was dead and myself was wounded she said and lord let me die with them which was no sooner said but she was struck with a bullet and fell down dead over the threshold
4326,4406-16882-0039.flac,and told me he had seen his sister marry and prayed me that i would not be troubled in reference to himself the occasion of his coming to see me at this time was this there was as i said about six miles from us a small plantation of indians where it seems he had been during his captivity
4327,4406-16882-0041.flac,by their noise and hooping they signified how many they had destroyed which was at that time twenty three
4328,4406-16882-0016.flac,my children gone my relations and friends gone our house and home and all our comforts within door and without all was gone except my life and i knew not but the next moment that might go too there remained nothing to me but one poor wounded babe
4329,4406-16882-0020.flac,that it did not quite fail one of the indians carried my poor wounded babe upon a horse it went moaning all along i shall die i shall die i went on foot after it with sorrow that cannot be expressed at length i took it off the horse
4330,4406-16882-0015.flac,and the dismalness of the present night my thoughts ran upon my losses in sad bereaved condition all was gone my husband gone at least separated from me he being in the bay and to add to my grief the indians told me they would kill him as he came homeward
4331,4406-16882-0011.flac,than that moment to end my days and that i may the better declare what happened to me during that grievous captivity i shall particularly speak of the several removes we had up and down in the wilderness the first remove now away we must go with those barbarous creatures
4332,4406-16882-0006.flac,i hope she is reaping the fruit of her good labours being faithful to the service of god in her place in her younger years she lay under much trouble upon spiritual accounts till it pleased god to make that precious scripture take hold of her heart and he said unto me
4333,4406-16882-0008.flac,and relations lie bleeding out their heart blood upon the ground there was one who was chopped into the head with a hatchet and stripped naked
4334,4406-16882-0017.flac,and it seemed at present worse than death that it was in such a pitiful condition bespeaking compassion and i had no refreshing for it nor suitable things to revive it little do many think what is the savageness and brutishness of this barbarous enemy
4335,4406-16883-0058.flac,were going to the french for powder but by the way the mohawks met with them and killed four of their company which made the rest turn back again for it might have been worse with him had he been sold to the french
4336,4406-16883-0060.flac,he told me he was very sick of a flux with eating so much blood they had turned him out of the wigwam and with him an indian papoose almost dead whose parents had been killed
4337,4406-16883-0043.flac,where we abode almost a fortnight here one asked me to make a shirt for her papoose for which she gave me a mess of broth which was thickened with meal made of the bark of a tree and to make it the better
4338,4406-16883-0049.flac,but when i was without and saw nothing but wilderness and woods and a company of barbarous heathens my mind quickly returned to me which made me think of that spoken concerning samson who said i will go out and shake myself as at other times
4339,4406-16883-0050.flac,but he wist not that the lord was departed from him about this time i began to think that all my hopes of restoration would come to nothing i thought of the english army and hoped for their coming and being taken by them but that failed
4340,4406-16883-0056.flac,and that all persuaded i was dead so like were these barbarous creatures to him who was a liar from the beginning as i was sitting once in the wigwam here philip's maid came in with the child in her arms
4341,4406-16883-0052.flac,as my master spake but instead of that my master himself was gone and i left behind so that my spirit was now quite ready to sink i asked them to let me go out and pick up some sticks that i might get alone and pour out my heart unto the lord
4342,4406-16883-0046.flac,as big as his two fingers and that he was very good meat but the lord upheld my spirit under this discouragement
4343,4406-16883-0044.flac,and a few roasted ground nuts i had not seen my son a pretty while
4344,4406-16883-0042.flac,but i had no other comforting answer from them than this that it would be no matter if my head were off too the thirteenth remove instead of going toward the bay which was what i desired
4345,4406-16883-0053.flac,they all gathered about the poor man asking him many questions i desired also to go and see him but when i came he was crying bitterly supposing they would quickly kill him whereupon i asked one of them whether they intended to kill him he answered me they would not
4346,4406-16883-0045.flac,and asked him when he saw him he answered me that such a time his master roasted him
4347,4406-16883-0051.flac,i hoped to be carried to albany as the indians had discoursed before but that failed also i thought of being sold to my husband
4348,4406-16883-0055.flac,that whatsoever the indians told me respecting him was vanity and lies some of them told me he was dead and they had killed him some said he was married again and that the governor wished him to marry and told him he should have his choice
4349,4406-16883-0057.flac,i told her i would tear her coat then with that my mistress rises up
4350,4406-16883-0047.flac,that makes the least conscience of speaking the truth in this place on a cold night as i lay by the fire i removed a stick that kept the heat from me
4351,4406-16883-0054.flac,he being a little cheered with that i asked him about the welfare of my husband he told me he saw him such a time in the bay and he was well but very melancholy by which i certainly understood though i suspected it before
4352,4406-16883-0048.flac,yet upon this and the like occasions i hope it is not too much to say with job
4353,4406-16883-0059.flac,then it proved to be in his remaining with the indians i went to see an english youth in this place
4354,4406-16883-0018.flac,i put it in my pocket to keep it safe yet notwithstanding somebody stole it we put five indian corns in the room of it which corns were the greatest provisions i had in my travel for one day
4355,4406-16883-0031.flac,and put it into my pocket and never let her see it afterwardthen they packed up their things to be gone and gave me my load i complained it was too heavy whereupon she gave me a slap in the face and bade me go
4356,4406-16883-0030.flac,and gave me some ground nuts and bade me come again and told me they would buy me if they were able and yet these were strangers to me that i never saw before the tenth remove
4357,4406-16883-0013.flac,afterwards he asked me to make a cap for his boy for which he invited me to dinner i went and he gave me a pancake about as big as two fingers it was made of parched wheat beaten and fried in bears grease
4358,4406-16883-0035.flac,be still and know that i am god psalm forty six
4359,4406-16883-0037.flac,i told them i could not tell where to go they bade me go look i told them if i went to another wigwam they would be angry and send me home again then one of the company drew his sword and told me he would run me through if i did not go presently then
4360,4406-16883-0036.flac,which were some refreshment to me towards night i gathered some sticks for my own comfort that i might not lie a cold but when we came to lie down they bade me go out and lie somewhere else for they had company they said come in more than their own
4361,4406-16883-0021.flac,but he living by the river side where i often went to fetch water i would often be putting of him in mind and calling for my pay at last he told me if i would make another shirt for papoose not yet born he would give me a knife which he did when i had done it
4362,4406-16883-0039.flac,i went to one wigwam and they told me they had no room then i went to another and they said the same at last an old indian bade me to come to him and his squaw gave me some ground nuts
4363,4406-16883-0002.flac,even as the psalmas says to declare the works of the lord and his wonderful power in carrying us along preserving us in the wilderness while under the enemy's hand and returning of us in safety again and his goodness
4364,4406-16883-0005.flac,which was the first time to my remembrance that i wept before them although i had met with so much affliction and my heart was many times ready to break yet could i not shed one tear in their sight but rather
4365,4406-16883-0023.flac,where they had stored up some in the ground
4366,4406-16883-0014.flac,and bear together and invited my master and mistress to dinner but the proud gossip because i served them both in one dish would eat nothing except one bit that he gave her upon the point of his knife
4367,4406-16883-0009.flac,it seems to be abat the devil lays to make men lose their precious time
4368,4406-16883-0016.flac,i pray god he may remember these things now he is returne in safety at this place the sun now getting higher what with the beams and heat of the sun and the smoke of the wigwams i thought i should have been blind
4369,4406-16883-0010.flac,when i had taken two or three pipes it was presently ready for another such a bewitching thing it is but i thank god he has now given me power over it surely there are many who
4370,4406-16883-0028.flac,for fear they would get it from me and there it lay all that day and night in my stinking pocket
4371,4406-16883-0029.flac,but now that was savory to me that one would think was enough to turn the stomach of a brute creature one bitter cold day i could find no room to sit down before the fire
4372,4406-16883-0000.flac,and the change that had come upon us we had husband and father and children and sisters and friends and relations and house and home and many comforts of this life but now we may say as job
4373,4406-16883-0011.flac,whereupon they fell to boiling of ground nuts and parching of corn
4374,4406-16883-0012.flac,during my abode in this place philip spake to me to make a shirt for his boy which i did for which he gave me a shilling i offered the money to my master but he bade me keep it and with it i bought a piece of horse flesh
4375,4406-16883-0008.flac,and asked me whether i would smoke it a usual compliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners but this no way suited me for though i had formerly used tobacco yet i had left it ever since i was first taken
4376,4406-16883-0034.flac,and would have had him gone back also but he would not but said he would go on and come to us again in three days my spirit was upon this i confess very impatient and almost outrageous
4377,4406-16883-0019.flac,and sell me for powder for so they had sometimes discourse i was utterly hopeless of getting home on foot the way that i came i could hardly bear to think of the many weary steps i had taken to come to this place the ninth remove
4378,4406-16883-0017.flac,who owned that mary thurston d came running after me and got it away again
4379,4406-16883-0025.flac,and then i returned again when i was returned i found myself as unsatisfied as i was before
4380,4406-16883-0020.flac,but instead of going either to albanear homeward we must go five miles up the river and then go over it here we abode awhile here lived a sorry indian who spoke to me to make him a shirt when i had done it he would pay me nothing
4381,4406-16883-0001.flac,and he lighted upon that comfortable scripture i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord
4382,4406-16883-0040.flac,and a good fire we had and through the good providence of god i had a comfortable lodging that night in the morning another indian bade me come at night and he would give me six ground nuts which i did
4383,4406-16883-0007.flac,then came one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me and another gave me half a pint of peas which was more worth than many bushels at another time then i went to see king philip he bade me come in and sit down
4384,4406-16883-0024.flac,i turned homeward again and met with my master he showed me the way to my son when i came to him i found him not well and withal he had a boil on his side which much troubled him we memoaned one another awhile as the lord helped us
4385,4406-16883-0006.flac,by the rivers of babylon there we sat down
4386,4406-16883-0003.flac,in bringing to my hand so many comfortable and suitable scriptures in my distress but to return
4387,4406-16883-0004.flac,and in the morning we must go over the river to philip's crew
4388,4406-16883-0015.flac,hearing that my son was come to this place i went to see him and found him lying flat upon the ground i asked him how he could sleep so he answered me that he was not asleep but at prayer and lay so that they might not observe what he was doing
4389,4406-16883-0032.flac,i lifted up my heart to god hoping the redemption was not far off and the rather because their insolency grew worse and worse but the thoughts of my going homeward for so we bent our course
4390,4406-16883-0038.flac,was i fain to stoop to this rude fellow and to go out in the night i knew not whither mine eyes have seen that fellow afterwards walking up and down boston under the appearance of a friend indian and several others of the light cut
4391,4406-16883-0026.flac,my son was ill and i could not but think of his mournful looks and no christian friend was near him to do any office of love for him either for soul or body and my poor girl i knew not where she was nor whether she was sick or well or alive or dead
4392,4406-16883-0033.flac,much cheered my spirit and made my burdens seem light and almost nothing at all but to my amazement and great perplexity the scale was soon turned for when we had gone a little way on a sudden my mistress gives out
4393,4406-16883-0027.flac,i repaired under these thoughts to my bible my great comfort in that time and that scripture came to my hand cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee psalm fifty five
4394,4406-16883-0022.flac,and i was not a little glad that i had anything they would accept of and be pleased with when we were at this place my master's maid came home she had been gone three weeks into the naragana set country to fetch corn
4395,4406-16883-0041.flac,we went in the morning to gather ground nuts to the river and went back again that night i went with a good load at my back for they when they went though but a little way would carry all their trumpery with them i told them the skin was off my back
4396,2136-5140-0012.flac,yet now to me it is but a picture in my brain and to you but a story told by me which you believe come dear let us be going so we descended the steps at the right
4397,2136-5140-0009.flac,and we walked in silence to the balustrade the base was too high at the spot where we reached it for me to see over but holding my hand he said
4398,2136-5140-0015.flac,would relate some little story reflecting even to my childish mind a strange suspicion of a spiritual meaning
4399,2136-5140-0005.flac,there came to knoll where she died a thin little man with large black eyes and a very grave dark face he was shut up a good deal with my dear father who was in deep affliction and missus rusk used to say
4400,2136-5140-0025.flac,in the grey of that wondrous morning on which she stood by the empty sepulchre accosted the figure standing near your mamma is alive but too far away to see or hear us swedenborg standing here can see and hear her
4401,2136-5140-0033.flac,holding his hand and looking stealthily he smiled sadly and said when sooner or later the time comes as hagar's eyes were opened in the wilderness and she beheld the fountain of water
4402,2136-5140-0007.flac,and there was confusion in the house and i dare say the maids made as much of a holiday as they could i remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man but i was not afraid of him for he was gentle though sad and seemed kind
4403,2136-5140-0039.flac,white and shadowy in the moonlight where for a long time after that ramble with the visionary i fancied the gate of death hidden only by a strange glamour and the dazzling land of ghosts were situate
4404,2136-5140-0034.flac,so shall each of us see the door open before us and enter in and be refreshed for a long time following this walk i was very nervous more so for the awful manner in which missus rusk received my statement
4405,2136-5140-0008.flac,he led me into the garden the dutch garden we used to call it with a ballustrade and statues at the farther front laid out in a carpet pattern of brilliant coloured flowers we came down the broad flight of cane stone steps into this
4406,2136-5140-0024.flac,i was afraid to approach oh is mamma taken away where is she where have they brought her to i was uttering unconsciously very nearly the question with which mary
4407,2136-5140-0014.flac,the same on which i was now looking in the distance every now and then he made me sit down to rest
4408,2136-5140-0019.flac,and so went on weeping and calling wildly on the deaf in the silent there was a stone bench some ten steps away from the tomb sit down beside me my child said the grave man with the black eyes very kindly and gently
4409,2136-5140-0017.flac,we came to me quite unexpectedly in the deep sylvan shadows upon the grey pillared temple forefronted with a slanting pedestal of lichen stained steps
4410,2136-5140-0004.flac,in all that concerned his religion from very early association there was to me something of the unearthly and spectral when my dear mamma died i was not nine years old and i remember two days before the funeral
4411,2136-5140-0023.flac,and has told me all that concerns us to know he says your mamma is not there she is taken away i cried starting up and with streaming eyes gazing on the building which though i stamped my feet in my distraction
4412,2136-5140-0028.flac,how true the description is which i give you i was very frightened for i feared that when he had done his narrative
4413,2136-5140-0029.flac,and of shadows where the dead were visible he leaned his elbow on his knee and his forehead on his hand which shaded his downcast eyes in that attitude he described to me a beautiful landscape
4414,2136-5140-0001.flac,hardly reached to the window at which i sat the shorn grass sloped gently downward from the window till it met the broad level on which stood in clumps or solitarily scattered some of the noblest timber in england
4415,2136-5140-0030.flac,radiant with a wondrous light in which rejoicing my mother moved along an airy path ascending among mountains of fantastic height and peaks melting in celestial coloring into the air
4416,2136-5140-0026.flac,and tells me all he sees just as i told you in the garden about the little boys and the cottage and the trees and the flowers which you could not see
4417,2136-5140-0038.flac,and interpreted the language of the bible and as dear papa accepted their ideas i am happy in thinking that they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy writ leaning on my hand i was now looking upon that solemn wood
4418,2136-5140-0000.flac,as already detailed that i was one night sitting at the great drawing room window lost in the melancholy reveries of night and in admiration of the moonlighted scene i was the only occupant of the room
4419,2136-5140-0021.flac,yes a stone wall with pillars too high for either you or me to see over but here he mentioned a name which i think must have been swedenborg
4420,2136-5140-0018.flac,the lonely sepulchre in which i had the morning before seen poor mamma laid at the sight the fountains of my grief reopened and i cried bitterly repeating oh mamma mamma little mamma
4421,2136-5140-0002.flac,hoar in the moonbeams stood those graceful trees casting their moveless shadows upon the grass and in the background crowning the undulation of the distance in masses were piled those woods among which lay the solitary tomb
4422,2136-5140-0040.flac,and i suppose these earlier associations gave to my reverie about my father's coming visitor
4423,2136-5140-0031.flac,he said the same words he had spoken before come dear let us go oh no no no not now i said resisting and very much frightened home i mean dear
4424,2136-5140-0003.flac,to me funereal but glorious woods which formed the background of the picture my thoughts recurred to my father's mysterious intimations and the image of the approaching visitor and a thought of the unknown journey saddened me
4425,2136-5140-0013.flac,and there we stood in rich sunlight among the many objects he had described is this your house my little men he asked of the children pretty little rosy boys who assented and he leaned with his open hand against the stem of one of the trees
4426,2136-5140-0037.flac,but i grew after a day or two so nervous that i laid it aside it is enough for me to know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions which so far from superseding confirmed
4427,2136-5140-0036.flac,or frighten her out of her senses in that lonely place of these swedenborgians indeed i know no more than i might learn from good missus rusk's very inaccurate talk two or three of them crossed in the course of my early life
4428,2136-5140-0016.flac,and somehow startling in its very vagueness thus entertained though a little awfully i accompanied the dark mysterious little whipper snapper through the woodland glades
4429,2136-5140-0032.flac,we cannot walk to the place i have described we can only reach it through the gate of death to which we are all tending young and old with sure steps and where is the gate of death i asked in a sort of whisper as we walked together
4430,2136-5140-0006.flac,and good mister clay ready at call in the village much good that little black whipper snapper will do him with that little black man on the day after the funeral i was sent out for some reason for a walk my governess was ill i know
4431,2136-5140-0011.flac,growing by the walls and windows and two little children are playing among the stems of the trees and we are on our way there and in a few minutes shall be under those trees ourselves and talking to those little children
4432,2136-5140-0022.flac,i only know that it sounded to me like the name of a magician in a fairy tale i fancied he lived in the wood which surrounded us and i began to grow frightened as he proceeded but swedenborg sees beyond it over and through it
4433,2136-5140-0020.flac,now what do you see there he asked pointing horizontally with his stick towards the centr of the opposite structure oh that that place where poor mamma is
4434,2136-5140-0027.flac,so i can tell you now as i did then and as we are both i hope walking on to the same place just as we did to the trees and cottage
4435,2136-5140-0010.flac,well you can't but i can see beyond it shall i tell you what i see ever so much i see a cottage with a steep roof that looks like gold in the sunlight
4436,2136-5140-0035.flac,with stern lips and upturned hands and eyes and an angry expostulation i do wonder at you marry quince letting the child walk into the woods with that limb of darkness it is a mercy he did not show her the devil
4437,2136-5143-0019.flac,do you think your house of nou dame dere is what you call haunt my dear why said i flushing and growing pale again i felt quite afraid of madame and confounded at the suddenness of all this because anne wixdead
4438,2136-5143-0016.flac,how solemn murmured madame wet no bell tomb
4439,2136-5143-0005.flac,the master says you may have the brandy bottle madame and i'm glad to be rid of it i am madame curtsied with a great smirk that was full of intangible hate and insult better your own brandy if drink you must exclaimed missus rusk
4440,2136-5143-0026.flac,what good man is your father very the kindest darling i don't know why it is madame i am so afraid of him and never could tell him how much i love him this confidential talking with madame strange to say
4441,2136-5143-0009.flac,madame was cool frank and fluent the brandy was purely medicinal she produced a document in the form of a note doctor somebody presented his compliments to madame de la rougere and ordered her a table spoonful of brandy
4442,2136-5143-0010.flac,and some drops of laudanum whenever the pain of stomach returned
4443,2136-5143-0040.flac,with which words she seized that joint and laughing spitefully she twisted it suddenly back i screamed while she continued to laugh will you tell yes yes let me go i shrieked she did not release it immediately however
4444,2136-5143-0002.flac,her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs from which only she apprehended surprise her great mouth was opened and her eyes absolutely goggled with eagerness she was devouring all that was passing there
4445,2136-5143-0038.flac,you do know everything of course
4446,2136-5143-0028.flac,oh no maufoir i have heard nothing but if the doctor came it was not because he was quite well but that doctor is a doctor in theology i fancy i know he is a sweden borgian and papa is so well he could not have come as a physician
4447,2136-5143-0004.flac,i am so glad to find you and you are dressed to come out we shall have so pleasant walk at that moment the door of my father's study opened and missus rusk with her dark energetic face very much flushed stepped out in high excitement
4448,2136-5143-0031.flac,as he made his will my dear every man so rich as he especially so old
4449,2136-5143-0008.flac,madame had commissioned her to buy it in the town and convey it to her bedroom upon this missus rusk impounded the flask and with anne beside her rather precipitately appeared before the master he heard and summoned madame
4450,2136-5143-0025.flac,with his arms round his knees very wicked old old man his face was like and white eyes so large come away madame you are trying to frighten me i said in the childish anger which accompanies fear madame laughed an ugly laugh and said
4451,2136-5143-0017.flac,as i approached i happened to look i can't tell why suddenly over my shoulder i was startled for madame was grimacing after me with a vile derisive distortion she pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing
4452,2136-5143-0020.flac,she says there is ghost how dark is this place and so many of the writhin family they are buried here is not so how high and thick are the trees all round and nobody comes near
4453,2136-5143-0018.flac,but it would not do she saw that i had detected her and she laughed aloud
4454,2136-5143-0039.flac,otherwise i will break your little finger tell me everything i know nothing of papa's will you don't know madame how you hurt me let us speak of something else you do know and you must tell patie do retete
4455,2136-5143-0037.flac,he has never spoken of it to me i know he loves me that is enough
4456,2136-5143-0027.flac,doctor brierly i think they call him yes a doctor brierly who remained a few days shall we begin to walk towards home madame do pray
4457,2136-5143-0024.flac,do madame pray speak of something else what little fool but no you are not afraid i have seen the goths myself i saw one for example last night shape like a monkey sitting in the conair
4458,2136-5143-0000.flac,chapter six a walk in the wood two little pieces of by play in which i detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion from the corner of the gallery i one day saw her when she thought i was out and all quiet
4459,2136-5143-0006.flac,you may come to the storeroom now or the butler can take it and off whisked missus rusk for the back staircase there had been no common skirmish on this occasion but a pitched battle madame had made a sort of pet of anne wixtead an under chambermaid
4460,2136-5143-0043.flac,what cross girl i will never play with you again never let us go home madame was silent and morose all the way home she would not answer my questions and affected to be very lofty and offended
4461,2136-5143-0033.flac,but you are not such fool as you feign yourself no no you know everything come tell me all about it is for your advantage you know what is in his will and when he wrout but madame i really know nothing of it
4462,2136-5143-0041.flac,but continued her torture and discordant laughter at last she finally released my finger
4463,2136-5143-0035.flac,he will not come to lie here a day sooner by cause of that
4464,2136-5143-0042.flac,what do you cry for little fool you've hurt me very much
4465,2136-5143-0034.flac,i can't say whether there is a will or not let us talk of something else
4466,2136-5143-0044.flac,this did not last very long however and she soon resumed her wonted ways and she returned to the question of the will but not so directly and with more art
4467,2136-5143-0029.flac,but still you know your father is old man
4468,2136-5143-0007.flac,with a brandy bottle under her apron stealing up stairs
4469,2136-5143-0001.flac,with her ear at the key hole of papa's study
4470,2136-5143-0021.flac,and madame rolled her eyes awfully as if she expected to see something unearthly and indeed looked very like it herself come away madame i said growing frightened and feeling that if i were once by any accident
4471,2136-5143-0011.flac,she claimed her medicine man's estimate of woman is higher than woman's own perhaps in their relations to men they are generally more trustworthy perhaps woman's is the juster and the other an appointed illusion
4472,2136-5143-0036.flac,would not that be a pity i really don't know anything of his will
4473,2136-5143-0012.flac,i don't know but so it is ordained missus rusk was recalled and i saw as you are aware madame's procedure during the interview it was a great battle a great victory madame was in high spirits
4474,2136-5143-0014.flac,but such resolutions do not last long with very young people and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood we were talking pretty much as usual i don't wish to go into the wood madame and for what poor mamma is buried there
4475,2136-5143-0015.flac,is there the vaut demanded madame eagerly i assented my faith curious reason you say because poor mamma is buried there you will not approach
4476,2136-5143-0022.flac,to give way to the panic that was gathering round me i should instantaneously lose all control of myself oh come away do madame i'm frightened no on the contrary sit here by me
4477,2136-5143-0003.flac,indignation however quickly returned and i came back treading briskly as i did so when i reached the angle of the gallery again madame i suppose had heard me for she was half way down the stairs
4478,2136-5143-0030.flac,oh yes he is old man
4479,2136-5143-0032.flac,there is no need of haste madame it is quite time enough when his health begins to fail
4480,2136-5143-0013.flac,the air was sweet the landscape charming i so good everything so beautiful where should we go this way i had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to madame i was so incensed at the treachery i had witnessed
4481,2136-5143-0023.flac,an goubisave raiment but i love very much to be near to the dead people
4482,2136-5147-0040.flac,madame uttered a slumbering moan and turned more upon her face clasping the coverlet faster about her madame it is maud and lady knollys we have come to relieve your ear pray let me see it
4483,2136-5147-0011.flac,looking down from the corners of her eyes in an interesting dejection
4484,2136-5147-0004.flac,but she may also be about the most pernicious inmate imaginable she may teach you a bad accent
4485,2136-5147-0025.flac,and it is really such a pity for she's a very pretty creature and a clever woman could make her quite charming
4486,2136-5147-0014.flac,voussove le melades se never visitors she replied with a startled sort of tartness and a momentary energy besides i cannot converse
4487,2136-5147-0016.flac,simple as i was i felt instinctively that madame was shamming she was overacting her transitions were too violent and beside she forgot that i knew how well she could speak english and must perceive that she was heightening the interest of her helplessness
4488,2136-5147-0005.flac,and heaven knows what beside send the housekeeper my dear to tell her that i am going to see her i had better go myself perhaps i said fearing a collision between missus rusk and the bitter frenchwoman very well dear
4489,2136-5147-0002.flac,but she is ill i answered and all this time i was ready to cry for vexation thinking of my dress which must be very absurd to elicit so much unaffected laughter from my experienced relative
4490,2136-5147-0032.flac,i suppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at knoll and thought it no harm to excite my vigilance but it was impossible long to be vexed with cousin monica
4491,2136-5147-0030.flac,and think that no widower is quite above or below that danger and i remember whenever my father which indeed was but seldom made a visit to town or anywhere else it was a saying of missus rusk
4492,2136-5147-0039.flac,getting round to the side of the bed and stooping over her madame lay still as a mouse cousin monica set down her two little vials on the table and stooping again over the bed began very gently with her fingers to lift the coverlet that covered her face
4493,2136-5147-0026.flac,eight and twenty years ago or more with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds well you know she has got ever so much now
4494,2136-5147-0029.flac,but it won't do no no monica we must take care of little maud some other way i was relieved we women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages
4495,2136-5147-0006.flac,not sorry somehow to escape before captain oakley returned as i went along the passage i was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it and trying in vain
4496,2136-5147-0003.flac,is she up or in bed in her room but not in bed i should so like to see her my dear it is not mere curiosity i assure you in fact curiosity has nothing on earth to do with it
4497,2136-5147-0022.flac,and has gone to the billiard room i think
4498,2136-5147-0020.flac,since the pain will not allow me to remain longer so with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused
4499,2136-5147-0017.flac,by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom i therefore said with a kind of courage which sometimes helped me suddenly oh madame don't you really think you might without much inconvenience see lady knollys for a very few minutes
4500,2136-5147-0021.flac,i returned to the drawing room
4501,2136-5147-0007.flac,to recollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of thatt beautiful and garrulous dandy i could not quite a reverse indeed still i was uncomfortable and feverish
4502,2136-5147-0033.flac,you know my dear your father is an oddity she said i don't mind him i never did you must not cracky my dear cracky decidedly cracky and she tapped the corner of her forehead with a look so sly and comical
4503,2136-5147-0009.flac,how is madame i asked quite well i believe answered the housekeeper drily nothing the matter that i know of she eat enough for two to day
4504,2136-5147-0038.flac,there was no answer so she opened the door and we both entered madame had rolled herself in the blue coverlet and was lying on the bed with her face buried in the pillow and enveloped in the covering perhaps she's asleep said lady knollys
4505,2136-5147-0013.flac,and with these words she turned a languid glance of gratitude on me which dropped on the ground lady knollys wishes very much to see you only for a few minutes if you could admit her
4506,2136-5147-0037.flac,and there was a fumbling at the handle but the bolt was out of order
4507,2136-5147-0027.flac,and though you would not have her then she has had her second husband since i can tell you i'm glad i was not the first said my father well they really say her wealth is absolutely immense her last husband
4508,2136-5147-0010.flac,i try to swallow a little to please hel and youre cold is it better she shook her head languidly her elbow resting on the chair and three finger tips supporting her forehead and then she made a little sigh
4509,2136-5147-0031.flac,i shan't wonder neither need you my dear if he brings home a young wife with him so my father with a kind look at her and a very tender one on me went silently to the library as he often did about that hour
4510,2136-5147-0028.flac,the russian merchant left her everything she has not a human relation and she is in the best set you were always a matchmaker monica said my father stopping and putting his hand kindly on hers
4511,2136-5147-0036.flac,she scaled the stairs eye following and having found the remedies we approached madame's room together i think while we were still at the end of the gallery madame heard and divined our approach for her door suddenly shut
4512,2136-5147-0001.flac,she is my governess a finishing governess missus rusk says finishing fiddle hoyty toyty and my lady's too grand to cut out your dresses and help you sew them and what does she do
4513,2136-5147-0035.flac,pain in her ear you say poor thing well dear i think i can cure that in five minutes i have it myself now and then come to my room and we'll get the bottles so she lighted her candle in the lobby and with a light and agile step
4514,2136-5147-0000.flac,lady knollys pursued her inquiries and why does not madame make your dresses my dear i'll wager a guinea the woman's a milliner did not she engage to make your dresses i
4515,2136-5147-0018.flac,but it is impossible you must see quite impossible i never you know refuse to take trouble when i am able never never and madame shed some tears which always came at call
4516,2136-5147-0024.flac,yes and really austen it is quite clear you ought to marry you want someone to take this girl out and look after her and who's to do it
4517,2136-5147-0023.flac,that then accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which i had heard as i passed the door i have been telling maud how detestably she is got up very thoughtful of you monica said my father
4518,2136-5147-0034.flac,that i think i should have laughed if the sentiment had not been so awfully irreverent well dear how is our friend the milliner madame is suffering so much from pain in her ear that she says it would be quite impossible to have the honor honor fiddle
4519,2136-5147-0019.flac,and with her hand pressed to her ear said very faintly be so good to tell your friend how you see me and how i suffel
4520,2136-5147-0015.flac,of ead and of the ear the right ear it is por foi agony absolutely and now it is here and she winced and moaned with her eyes closed and her hand pressed to the organ affected
4521,2136-5147-0012.flac,but i am quite happy
4522,2136-5147-0008.flac,girls of my then age will easily conceive how miserable under similar circumstances such a misgiving would make them it was a long way to madame's room i met missus rusk bustling along the passage with a housemaid
4523,5652-19215-0040.flac,the great brazen helmet of ten points why did achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances because helen allowed paris to take her garter with cosette's gotte
4524,5652-19215-0023.flac,every morning a fresh offering of bricabrac from the grandfather to cosette all possible knickknacks glittered around her one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said
4525,5652-19215-0001.flac,the grandfather was not the least happy of them all he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed and she has so sweet and good an air
4526,5652-19215-0014.flac,was to be turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was very acceptable and as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million there were some peculiarities here and there it is true
4527,5652-19215-0022.flac,with wings of meclin lace the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather
4528,5652-19215-0009.flac,of which of the two fauchellents cosette was the daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal an act de notorete was drawn up cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle euphrasie fauchellent
4529,5652-19215-0054.flac,be one of the gods ah people might be sylphs game and laughter agirispides they are stupids
4530,5652-19215-0055.flac,the empryom with the swans and the eagles even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisee of the frogs
4531,5652-19215-0037.flac,that joyous luxury which every one possessed music forming part of the wedding a symphony above stairs a beating of drums below stairs the dances the joyous faces around the table
4532,5652-19215-0028.flac,which had the kindness to indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and which

4545,5652-19215-0012.flac,as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety four thousand francs
4546,5652-19215-0059.flac,somewhat resentful in her inmost soul
4547,5652-19215-0013.flac,but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euphracy five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the covenant this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party

4549,5652-19215-0017.flac,it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments an presents while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status

4554,5652-19215-0006.flac,and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem
4555,5652-19215-0010.flac,she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead
4556,5652-19215-0011.flac,that he was appointed under the name of fauchelent as cosette's guardian
4557,5652-19215-0053.flac,you must make a dream whirl round the bride a marriage should be royal and cimrical it should promenate its ceremony from the cathedral of the rhymes to the pegoda of chantelu

4563,5652-19215-0004.flac,the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us
4564,5652-19215-0057.flac,receives no impressions either human or pleasant or painful with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes this devotion
4565,5652-19215-0007.flac,a sure means of not encountering any objections cosette was the only sion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fauchellents two brother fauchellens had been gardeners to the covent
4566,5652-19215-0056.flac,do not prune them of their splendours don't scrimp on the day when you beam the wedding is not the housekeeping oh if i were to carry out my fancy it would be gallant violins would be hurd under the trees
4567,5652-19215-0029.flac,equal to that for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest
4568,5652-19215-0060.flac,she would have left him poor so much the worse for my nephew he is wedding a beggar let him be a beggar himself but cosette's half million pleased the aunt and altered her inward situation so far
4569,5652-19215-0005.flac,jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy
4570,5652-19215-0038.flac,the fine spun gallant compliments the songs the fireworks the frank laughter the devil's own row the huge knots of ribbon i regret the bride's garter the bride's garter is cousin to the girdle of venus
4571,5652-19215-0061.flac,one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people since they did not need it

4577,5652-19215-0033.flac,i grant to this age the device dirty cleanliness
4578,5652-19215-0046.flac,people thought much of looking well they embroidered and tinted themselves a bourgeois had the air of a flower a marquis had the air of a precious stone people had no straps to their boots they had no boots
4579,5652-19215-0048.flac,one of the sides of that century was delicate the other was magnificent and by the green cabbages people amuse themselves to day people are serious the bourgeois is a veris the bourgeois is a prude
4580,5652-19215-0000.flac,everything was made ready for the wedding the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then december a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed
4581,5652-19215-0041.flac,homer would construct the iliad he would put in his poem
4582,5652-19215-0018.flac,nothing so amused him as being magnificent he had given to cosette
4583,5652-19215-0015.flac,that the cloud did not last long she had marius the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her
4584,5652-19215-0035.flac,i belong to it he who loves well lashes well thereupon i say plainly that nowadays
4585,5652-19215-0047.flac,they were spruce shining waved lustrous fluttering dainty coquettish which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their sides the humming bird has beacon claws
4586,5652-39938-0066.flac,everything is to be avoided which interferes with the night's sleep
4587,5652-39938-0065.flac,while the advice of the physician ought thus to emphasize the positive elements which work not towards rest but toward a harmonious mental activity we must not forget some essential negative prescriptions
4588,5652-39938-0019.flac,the finest adjustment has to come in during the treatment itself and the response of the patient often has to suggest entirely new lines of procedure
4589,5652-39938-0035.flac,every cause of friction which can be permanently annihilated for the patient certainly should be removed this negative remedy demands its positive supplement
4590,5652-39938-0053.flac,every effort should be estimated with reference to the standard of that particular case this relativity of the mental reaction on the demands of life must always be in the foreground of the psychotherapeutic regime
4591,5652-39938-0022.flac,it cannot be denied that the one great obstacle in the work of the routine physician is the lack of time and patience which is needed for successful treatment to prescribe drugs is always quicker than to influence the mind
4592,5652-39938-0056.flac,they should not be complete rest or complete change of life for any length of time but a continuation of the life for which adjustment has been learned with a reasonable reduction of the demands and stimulations
4593,5652-39938-0047.flac,of course we stand to day before a much more complex surrounding than our ancestors but still more quickly than the complexity have grown the means to master it
4594,5652-39938-0051.flac,if i have a ten pound weight in one hand i may find that i must have one pound more in the other hand to discriminate the difference
4595,5652-39938-0028.flac,especially in the digestive and sexual spheres are sources of irritation which slowly influence the whole personality
4596,5652-39938-0052.flac,yet that quiet countryman may react in his narrow system not less when the modest changes in his surroundings provoke him the gossip of his neighbor may undermine his nervous system just as much as a political fight or the struggles of the exchange that of the city man
4597,5652-39938-0021.flac,subtle adjustment to the personal needs and to the individual conditions is necessary in every case where the psychical factor is to play an important role
4598,5652-39938-0057.flac,the intellectual worker ought to decrease his work the overbusy society woman ought to stay in bed one day in the week the man in the midst of the rush of life ought to cut down his obligations
4599,5652-39938-0032.flac,we may be guided by the psychological experiments which have been made in the interest of testing the fatigue induced by mental work
4600,5652-39938-0004.flac,the intellectual clearness of the patient too easily tempts one into trusting the sincerity of his story and yet the most important ideas clustering perhaps about love or ambition about vice or crime about business failure or family secrets
4601,5652-39938-0064.flac,in the second place come games and sport which may enter into their right if fatigue can be avoided harmonious joyful company as different as possible from the depressing company of the sanitariums will add its pleasantness
4602,5652-39938-0059.flac,that they are interruptions of that which must last and that they are not themselves to become lasting states
4603,5652-39938-0050.flac,above all the intensity of mental stimuli is always relative the psychologist knows the experiments which determine that we perceive the difference of impressions as alike when the stimuli are proportional
4604,5652-39938-0020.flac,more than in any other field of medicine the physician himself has to extend his influence far beyond the office hours and the strictly medical relations and yet on the other hand there is no department of medicine in which the treatment might not profit by the psychotherapeutic influence
4605,5652-39938-0041.flac,the over excitement brought to everybody by the sensationalism of our newspapers and of our public life all injure the brain cells and damage the equilibrium
4606,5652-39938-0055.flac,complete rest for instance for a hard brain worker hardly ought to be recommended unless a high degree of exhaustion has come on if routine prescriptions are to be admitted at all
4607,5652-39938-0034.flac,the instinct of the physician has to find the middle way between a temporary removal of irritation which really allows a development of new energies and a mere interruption which simply damages the acquired relative adjustment
4608,5652-39938-0007.flac,will support the physician and accordingly his examination is not obliged to trap the patient but simply to guide him to important points but then begins the most essential study of diagnostical differentiation
4609,5652-39938-0031.flac,often within a surprisingly short time the brain gathers the energies to overcome the frictions with unavoidable surroundings yet here the physician has to adjust the prescribed dose of outing very carefully to the special case
4610,5652-39938-0005.flac,withheld and may frustrate every psychotherapeutic influence where suspicion is awake and mere confidential talk and persuasion seem insufficient
4611,5652-39938-0015.flac,every element of a man's life history impressions of early childhood his love and his successes his diseases and his distresses his acquaintances and his reading his talent his character his sincerity his energy his intelligence
4612,5652-39938-0045.flac,earlier times surely may have treated even the stronger varieties of this kind as troublesome variations in the sphere of the normal
4613,5652-39938-0048.flac,there is no nation on earth which is more proud of its rush and its hurry than the american people and yet what a
4614,5652-39938-0016.flac,everything ought to determine the choice of the psychotherapeutic steps as it is entirely impossible to determine all those factors by any sufficient inquiry
4615,5652-39938-0036.flac,the patient must be brought under conditions and influences which give fair chances for the recuperation of his energies too often from the standpoint of the psychologist the prescription is simply rest
4616,5652-39938-0037.flac,as far as rest involves sleep it is certainly the ideal prescription there is no other influence which builds up the injured central nervous system as safely as sound natural sleep
4617,5652-39938-0024.flac,namely to remove the external sources of the disturbance external indicates theire not only the outer world but also the own body outside the conscious parts of the brain
4618,5652-39938-0030.flac,however often he may get the impression that such a liberation would stop the source of the mental trouble
4619,5652-39938-0003.flac,it is surprising how often unsuspected vistas of thoughts and impulses and emotions are opened by an inquiring analysis where the direct report of the patient does not awaken the least suspicion
4620,5652-39938-0026.flac,growths in the nose may be operated upon the astigmatic or the short sighted eye may be corrected by glasses the child who is hard of hearing may at least be seated near the teacher and the backward children quickly reach the average level
4621,5652-39938-0062.flac,the most effective agency for this task is contact with beauty beauty in nature and life beauty in art and literature and music
4622,5652-39938-0025.flac,if we take it in the widest meaning this would evidently include every possible medical task from filling a painful tooth to operating on a painful appendix as in every case where pain results the mental equilibrium is disturbed by it and the normal mental life of the patient reduced in its efficiency
4623,5652-39938-0000.flac,the psychological work of the physician does not begin with his curative efforts therapy is always only the last step diagnosis and observation have to precede and an inquiry into the causes of the disease is essential
4624,5652-39938-0013.flac,there are no two cases alike and not only the easily recognizable differences of sex and age and occupation in education and financial means and temperament and capacity are decisive
4625,5652-39938-0058.flac,but probably each of them does better to go on than simply to swear off altogether their rest ought to have the character of vacation that means interruptions without the usual activity ought to be short periods spent with the distinct feeling
4626,5652-39938-0001.flac,the whole equipment of the modern laboratory ought to be put at its disposal perceptions and associations reactions and expressions ought to be examined with the same carefulness with which the conscientious physician examines the blood and the urine
4627,5652-39938-0060.flac,strenuosity must not mean an external rush with the gestures of overbusy excitement but certainly the doctrine of the lazy life is wretched psychotherapy as long as no serious illness is in question
4628,5652-39938-0029.flac,to be sure the brain disturbance may have reached a point where the mere removal of the original affliction is not sufficient to reinstate the normal balance of mental energies but wherever such a bodily irritation goes on it is never too late to abolish it in the interests of psychotherapy
4629,5652-39938-0042.flac,that is a story which we hear a thousand times nowadays yet it is doubtful whether there is really much truth in such a claim and whether much wise psychotherapy can be deduced from it
4630,5652-39938-0018.flac,it is therefore certainly not enough that the knowledge of the physician simply decide beforehand on a definite course of psychical treatment and leave the carrying out to a well meaning minister or any other medical amateur who schematically follows the indicated path
4631,5652-39938-0040.flac,the wild chase for luxury in the higher classes reenforced by the commercialism of our time the hard and the monotonous labor in our modern mills and mines for the lower classes
4632,5652-39938-0012.flac,but one rule is common to all of them never use psychotherapeutic methods in a schematic way like a rigid pattern pschematic treatment is a poor treatment in every department of medicine but in psychotherapeutics it is disastrous
4633,5652-39938-0061.flac,by far the best alteration is therefore even in the periods of interruption not simply rest but new engagements which awaken new interests and stimulate neged mental factors disburdening the overstrained elements of mental life
4634,5652-39938-0044.flac,even to day most people are still without suspicion that a neroaesthenic or a psychoaesthenic or a hysteric disturbance of the nervous system may be in its beginning
4635,5652-39938-0014.flac,but all the subtle variations of prejudices and beliefs preferences and dislikes family life and social surroundings ambitions and prospects memories and fancies
4636,5652-39938-0008.flac,with all the means not only of psychology but of nauralogy an internal medicine he has to separate the particular case from similar ones and to examine whether he deals with for instance a hysteric or with a paronauic
4637,5652-39938-0002.flac,and yet no psychaical treatment can start successfully so long as the patient is brooding on secret thoughts at the bottom of his mind the desire to hide them may often be itself a part of the disease
4638,5652-39938-0049.flac,moreover our life has probably become cooler there is less emotionalism less sentimentality more business like attitude and that all means less innerfriction and excitement in public life too less fear of war and less religious struggle
4639,5652-39938-0043.flac,we may begin even with the very justifiable doubts whether nervousness really has increased in our time earlier periods had not so many names for those symptoms and were not able to discriminate them with the same clearness
4640,5652-39938-0011.flac,in a similar way the psychical examination tests the hallucinations and illusions the variations and defects of memory and attention of judgment and reasoning of orientation and self consciousness of emotions and volitions
4641,5652-39938-0033.flac,if perhaps four hours of concentrated work are done without pauses experiments show that the quality of the work deteriorates measured for instance by the number of mistakes in quick calculation
4642,5652-39938-0023.flac,the first method to bring back the psychophysical equilibrium
4643,5652-39938-0046.flac,the progress of scientific hygene has brought every one much nearer to a harmonious functioning of the organism and the progress of technique has removed innumerable difficulties from the play of life
4644,5652-39938-0009.flac,and he will not forget that there exist almost no symptoms of serious diseases which the nervous system of the hysteric may not imitate for a time
4645,5652-39938-0017.flac,most of the adjustment of method must be left to the instinct of the physician in which wide experience solid knowledge tact and sympathy ought to be blended even the way in which the patient reacts on the method will often guide the instinct of the well trained psychotherapist
4646,5652-39938-0038.flac,and loss of sleep is certainly one of the most pernicious conditions for the brain again rest is a great factor in those systemic rest cures which for a long while were almost the fashion with the neuralogist
4647,5652-39938-0006.flac,the physician may feel justified in the interest of his patient in drawing the thoughts out of their hiding place by artificial means skill tact and experience are needed there as a matter of course
4648,5652-39938-0054.flac,simply to withdraw a patient from the one kind of life
4649,5652-39938-0027.flac,no doubt in the life of the adult as well often almost insignificant and from a strictly physical point of view unimportant abnormalities in the bodily system
4650,5652-39938-0039.flac,it is simply meant that he give up his fatiguing daily work even if that work is made up of a round of entertainments and calls and social engagements the neuro aesthenic and all similar varieties are sent away from the noise of the city away from the rush of their busy life
4651,5652-39938-0010.flac,not ours is the task of analyzing special methods of neurological and mental differential diagnosis such as are used in the psycheatric clinic and in the office of the nerve specialist there the family history with reference to nervous and other diseases
4652,5652-39938-0063.flac,to enjoy a landscape ought to be not merely a negative rest for the man of the office building and good literature or music absorbs the mental energies and harmonizes them
4653,211-122442-0022.flac,besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at saint cloud
4654,211-122442-0043.flac,the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied d'artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me
4655,211-122442-0055.flac,which may betray him who wears it sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign never said d'artagnan then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony
4656,211-122442-0033.flac,is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked d'artagnan do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open
4657,211-122442-0051.flac,oh the women the women cried the old soldier i know them by their romantic imagination everything that savors of mystery charms them so you have seen the arm that was all you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are
4658,211-122442-0052.flac,no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man
4659,211-122442-0021.flac,d'artagnan's intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him
4660,211-122442-0063.flac,by the by you can be sure of your lackey mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all d'artagnan blushed my mistress above all repeated he mechanically
4661,211-122442-0011.flac,exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way and to shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven
4662,211-122442-0061.flac,shun it were it with a child of ten years old if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame if you cross a bridge feel every plank of it with your foot
4663,211-122442-0069.flac,and how the devil did you escape
4664,211-122442-0007.flac,there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you be this evening about ten o'clock at saint cloud
4665,211-122442-0054.flac,well then off to the nearest goldsmiths and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one
4666,211-122442-0005.flac,it is not natural for letters to enter people's houses in this manner if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but no all was hermetically sealed
4667,211-122442-0049.flac,by whom did the queen send you this jewel she gave it to me herself where in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet how giving me her hand to kiss
4668,211-122442-0015.flac,i am going out for all day perhaps you are therefore your own master till seven o'clock in the evening but at seven o'clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses
4669,211-122442-0006.flac,there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted into his chamber and opened the letter
4670,211-122442-0042.flac,now let us talk about yourself my young friend
4671,211-122442-0035.flac,that d'artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter
4672,211-122442-0059.flac,has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested what will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty's service pardieu
4673,211-122442-0066.flac,did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess
4674,211-122442-0044.flac,the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself
4675,211-122442-0077.flac,was busy grooming them and had already finished too
4676,211-122442-0016.flac,we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways you will take your musketoon and your pistols
4677,211-122442-0060.flac,at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions if any one seeks a quarrel with you
4678,211-122442-0039.flac,he certainly would not have remarked it
4679,211-122442-0072.flac,it is woman who has ruined us still ruins us and will ruin us as long as the world stands take my advice and set out this evening
4680,211-122442-0070.flac,they merit richly that piece of attention on your part
4681,211-122442-0027.flac,brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris
4682,211-122442-0079.flac,but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you
4683,211-122442-0002.flac,when he was left stiff as a rush in london in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses has any one brought a letter for me asked d'artagnan eagerly
4684,211-122442-0050.flac,her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor and that in the presence of witnesses imprudent thrice imprudent
4685,211-122442-0037.flac,this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonaceux will visit the conjugal domicile
4686,211-122442-0030.flac,as i see there is no concealing anything from you yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge
4687,211-122442-0073.flac,ah that's quite another thing but promise me if you should not be killed to night that you will go to morrow i promise it do you need money
4688,211-122442-0076.flac,as he passed the hotel des gardes he took a glance into the stables three of the four horses had already arrived
4689,211-122442-0045.flac,and knows that i have been to london the devil you have been to london was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger beware my dear d'artagnan a present from an enemy is not a good thing
4690,211-122442-0019.flac,well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready
4691,211-122442-0080.flac,two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features
4692,211-122442-0038.flac,so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend amuse yourself well replied bonaceux
4693,211-122442-0074.flac,but your companions i don't think they can be in need of any we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure
4694,211-122442-0018.flac,i prefer travelling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear
4695,211-122442-0028.flac,far from here oh lord no about forty leagues only
4696,211-122442-0024.flac,whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal's executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture
4697,211-122442-0023.flac,the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man
4698,211-122442-0000.flac,he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey
4699,211-122442-0062.flac,lest one should give way beneath you if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head if you stay out late be always followed by your lackey and let your lackey be armed if
4700,211-122442-0009.flac,his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love
4701,211-122442-0047.flac,beware of the enemy who makes you presencs
4702,211-122442-0031.flac,and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer
4703,211-122442-0071.flac,ah young man young man some flirtation or other
4704,211-122442-0067.flac,what has become of your three companions
4705,211-122442-0040.flac,his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative he found treville in a joyful mood he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered
4706,211-122442-0056.flac,does not find such stones in his mother's jewel case you think then i have something to dread asked d'artagnan i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mind the match of which is already lighted
4707,211-122442-0008.flac,while reading this letter d'artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers it was the first billais he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him
4708,211-122442-0075.flac,neither of them had returned their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other
4709,211-122442-0064.flac,you are acquainted with the scriptures
4710,211-122442-0036.flac,which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little this evening you said well
4711,211-122442-0017.flac,ah like the charming journey the other day
4712,211-122442-0013.flac,which the liberality of d'artagnan had not entirely effaced left alone d'artagnan read and reread his billet then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress
4713,211-122442-0053.flac,shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsl of a friend
4714,211-122442-0081.flac,and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed
4715,211-122442-0083.flac,heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse
4716,211-122442-0026.flac,in a tine of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days
4717,211-122442-0048.flac,why it is indeed a true royal jewel
4718,211-122442-0057.flac,the devil said d'artagnan
4719,211-122442-0014.flac,at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams
4720,211-122442-0025.flac,d'artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonaceux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance
4721,211-122442-0034.flac,particularly in the night what the deuce can you expect i am no swordsman well don't be alarmed if i return at one two or three o'clock in the morning
4722,211-122442-0078.flac,how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man
4723,211-122442-0065.flac,for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero
4724,211-122442-0020.flac,perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said d'artagnan and nodding to planchet he went out
4725,211-122442-0004.flac,i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter
4726,211-122442-0003.flac,but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket
4727,211-122442-0001.flac,whom he had sent home two hours before from the hotel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him the reader may ask
4728,211-122442-0029.flac,where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not
4729,211-122442-0010.flac,did i not guess truly is it not some bad affair
4730,211-122442-0046.flac,are there not some latin verses upon that subject stop yes doubtless replied d'artagnan
4731,211-122442-0068.flac,detained by an accusation of coining
4732,211-122442-0082.flac,shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction
4733,211-122442-0012.flac,my dear planchet i am the happiest of men
4734,211-122442-0032.flac,so trifling indeed that d'artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man ah may you be a true prophet said d'artagnan laughing no
4735,211-122442-0058.flac,the devil what must i do above all things be always on your guard the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort
4736,211-122442-0041.flac,he had retired at one o'clock under the pretence of being indisposed as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six o'clock in the morning now said treville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone
4737,211-122425-0072.flac,in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous
4738,211-122425-0078.flac,returned to his hotel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner
4739,211-122425-0079.flac,that his eminence's guardsmen had received
4740,211-122425-0071.flac,not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you
4741,211-122425-0069.flac,we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair
4742,211-122425-0081.flac,his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter
4743,211-122425-0074.flac,perfectly does he talk with difficulty but he can speak
4744,211-122425-0075.flac,let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth
4745,211-122425-0080.flac,not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his
4746,211-122425-0073.flac,of which the doctor says bad things
4747,211-122425-0076.flac,then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed
4748,211-122425-0070.flac,and all the fault is with your musketeers
4749,211-122425-0077.flac,placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed
4750,211-122425-0040.flac,that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door an instant after the guardsmen descended in his turn
4751,211-122425-0041.flac,which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer
4752,211-122425-0007.flac,ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of justice before everything
4753,211-122425-0044.flac,he hoped to intimidate but d'artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts
4754,211-122425-0009.flac,and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say
4755,211-122425-0013.flac,then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty cannot be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king
4756,211-122425-0045.flac,and as d'artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d'artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder
4757,211-122425-0024.flac,he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy
4758,211-122425-0004.flac,and by and by by and by we will see ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty
4759,211-122425-0022.flac,that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty
4760,211-122425-0006.flac,la veville said he take my place
4761,211-122425-0067.flac,but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had endeavored to burn now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion
4762,211-122425-0068.flac,he repaired therefore immediately to his hotel and caused himself to be announced the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem both were men of courage and honor
4763,211-122425-0027.flac,that is true said the king but never mind treville come still by the back staircase treville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master
4764,211-122425-0017.flac,and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal's guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory
4765,211-122425-0005.flac,the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket
4766,211-122425-0064.flac,every one to return home and wait for news
4767,211-122425-0028.flac,he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited
4768,211-122425-0010.flac,had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning the party was to take place at saint germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carme dechaux where they were disturbed by dejussac cay jussac
4769,211-122425-0018.flac,one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself d'artagnan sire
4770,211-122425-0015.flac,but i will not swear to it sire you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct
4771,211-122425-0037.flac,look at me as long as you like my little gentlemen i have said what i have said
4772,211-122425-0046.flac,in whose service he had a relative
4773,211-122425-0043.flac,bernajioux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom
4774,211-122425-0032.flac,although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion
4775,211-122425-0031.flac,and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he excepted not knowing what to do with this time from nine o'clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve the two musketeers were already there and were playing together
4776,211-122425-0035.flac,his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely
4777,211-122425-0021.flac,he was dressed as a citizen the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see treville interrupted the king it was they who attacked
4778,211-122425-0039.flac,lest it be observed that we go out together you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way that's true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man
4779,211-122425-0056.flac,they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong they soon tired of the sport besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way
4780,211-122425-0063.flac,gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and more over came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it
4781,211-122425-0000.flac,do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers
4782,211-122425-0060.flac,directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of saint germain
4783,211-122425-0062.flac,the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal
4784,211-122425-0033.flac,and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting
4785,211-122425-0048.flac,and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue
4786,211-122425-0020.flac,placing his hand upon his hip sire resumed treville as i told you
4787,211-122425-0052.flac,who hastened to the succour of their comrades the mele became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers
4788,211-122425-0014.flac,are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes treville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty
4789,211-122425-0002.flac,i'll be their warrantee and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty's service but what are they to do
4790,211-122425-0042.flac,never mind be content i will do my best on guard but said he whom d'artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better
4791,211-122425-0038.flac,you 're in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing what is your name
4792,211-122425-0036.flac,declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms
4793,211-122425-0016.flac,you are right treville but they were not alone your musketeers they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the king's musketeers one of whom was wounded
4794,211-122425-0003.flac,would not one say he was speaking of a religious community in truth my dear captain
4795,211-122425-0026.flac,it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand treville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel it is a brawl
4796,211-122425-0047.flac,and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with ta third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d'artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror
4797,211-122425-0034.flac,passed so close to d'artagnan's face
4798,211-122425-0011.flac,who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah you incline me to think so said the king there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire
4799,211-122425-0050.flac,to his eminence thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king's musketeers in these quarrels
4800,211-122425-0025.flac,it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty jussac one of the first swordsman in the kingdom well sire for once he found his master i will see this young man treville i will see him and if anything can be done
4801,211-122425-0058.flac,and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal
4802,211-122425-0059.flac,and the two will pass off together
4803,211-122425-0057.flac,who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance
4804,211-122425-0019.flac,he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well tell me how treville you know how i delight an accounts of war and fighting
4805,211-122425-0008.flac,yes sire as they always do and how did the thing happen let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible
4806,211-122425-0049.flac,at these cries all who were in the hotel rushed oud and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded
4807,211-122425-0066.flac,whose relative as we already know bernajoux was
4808,211-122425-0054.flac,excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hotel
4809,211-122425-0023.flac,brave young man murmured the king well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussak the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry
4810,211-122425-0012.flac,but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood
4811,211-122425-0051.flac,to the rescue musketeers to the rescue
4812,211-122425-0029.flac,but d'artagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams
4813,211-122425-0055.flac,domestics in daring to make a sordie upon the king's musketeers the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o'clock struck
4814,211-122425-0053.flac,the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state
4815,211-122425-0061.flac,required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companion saw his brow become darker had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency
4816,211-122425-0065.flac,with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal's guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king's musketeers
4817,211-122425-0001.flac,ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged no sire replied treville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire
4818,211-122425-0030.flac,d'artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis
4819,3235-11599-0019.flac,in which there are three beats the first one being accented the second and third unaccented
4820,3235-11599-0026.flac,or of two and three sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition while the seven beat measure is taken in groups of four and three or of three and four
4821,3235-11599-0023.flac,it will be noted that the two measures
4822,3235-11599-0002.flac,measures are similarly accented groups of evenly spaced beats each group having at least one accented and one non accented beat the strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure
4823,3235-11599-0025.flac,quintuple five beat and septuple seven beat measures are occasionally met with but these are rare and will always be spiratic the five beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two
4824,3235-11599-0001.flac,as ev g at the beginning and end of a movement but from the standpoint of the ear a single isolated measure is not possible and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form
4825,3235-11599-0012.flac,into several constituent groups the principal compound measures are four beat and six beat both being referred to as compound duple measures five beat seven beat nine beat and twelve beat measures
4826,3235-11599-0006.flac,while measure is the grouping of these beats according to some specified system in listening to a piece of music two hearers a and b may feel the rhythm equally strongly
4827,3235-11599-0009.flac,insyncopation the normal system of accenting is temporarily suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part of the measure syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents
4828,3235-11599-0027.flac,but usage varies somewhat and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four half measure
4829,3235-11599-0016.flac,there is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words simple and compound when applied in this connection the principal question at issue being whether four beat measure is an individual variety
4830,3235-11599-0008.flac,rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing inherent in the music itself while measure is to a certain extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have adopted for practical purposes ninety eight
4831,3235-11599-0022.flac,four sex tuple in which there are six beats the first and fourth being accented the others not in rapid timpi this is always taken as compound duple measure adotted quarter note having a beat
4832,3235-11599-0007.flac,but a may subjectively group the beats into one two one two et cetera while b feels the groups as one to three four one to thre four et cetera
4833,3235-11599-0024.flac,but these are practically always taken as three beat and four beat measures respectively being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet
4834,3235-11599-0014.flac,clascifies measures as duple triple or quadruple specifying that a simple measure is one in which each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided into halves
4835,3235-11599-0005.flac,et cetera which form the actual musical content of these groups the student will note the essential difference between rhythm and measure rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a series of beats or pulses
4836,3235-11599-0021.flac,the second and fourth unaccented
4837,3235-11599-0017.flac,or whether it is a variety compounded out of two beat measures either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats as is often necessary in slow tempy
4838,3235-11599-0010.flac,and compound a simple measure is one which has but a single accent
4839,3235-11599-0013.flac,are also classified as compound measures an english writer
4840,3235-11599-0018.flac,perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true
4841,3235-11599-0011.flac,two beat measure and three beat measure a compound measure is as its name implies one made up by combining two or more simple measures or by the elaboration of a single measure in slow tempo
4842,3235-11599-0004.flac,one or more of these beats being stronger than the rest two certain rhythmic figures

4844,3235-11599-0028.flac,but an incomplete circle differentiating two beat imperfect measure from three beat perfect measure
4845,3235-11599-0015.flac,and that a compound measure is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted note whose value can be divided into three parts
4846,3235-11599-0003.flac,two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical measure one a group of even beats or pulses always felt though not always actually sounded
4847,3235-11599-0020.flac,three eighth three quarter and three half measure respectively three quadruple in which there are four beats the first and third being accented primary accent on one secondary accent on three
4848,3235-28433-0039.flac,both groups of craft were evidently waiting for the ice to clear from bearing sea before proceeding on their way northward and we counted sixteen ships of different kinds and sizes the majority of them large steamers
4849,3235-28433-0049.flac,an old friend of our captain had decided to follow in our wake he being less familiar than the latter with alaskin waters
4850,3235-28433-0045.flac,with the service of the ship's men leaving unalaska the sun shone clear and cold upon the mountains wherein places the sides looked black from the late fires started in the deep tundra by miscreants
4851,3235-28433-0040.flac,all were loaded with passengers and freight for nome scout boats had already been sent out to investigate and find if possible a passage through the ice fields
4852,3235-28433-0038.flac,and here numbers of ships lay anchored at rest passing along easily beyond another high mountain we were soon at the dock of unalaska beside other great ships in port
4853,3235-28433-0046.flac,the tops of the mountains were covered with snow down deep gorges dashed mountain waters of melting snow and ice hurrying to leap off gullied and rocky cliffs into the sea their progress was never impeded
4854,3235-28433-0043.flac,and each having a curiosity to see if they were faring as well or ill as he comparing notes as to the expense of traveling with the different companies et cetera passengers on the saint paul agreed that they had no kick coming
4855,3235-28433-0037.flac,thereby casting long shadows aslant our pathway so delicately shaded in greens the little hamlet of dutch harbor nestled cosily at the foot of the mountains which bordered the bay
4856,3235-28433-0042.flac,at unalaska we spent four days taking on fresh water and coal during which time passengers visited back and forth from the wating steamers many persons having friends on other boats
4857,3235-28433-0041.flac,and the return of these scouts with good news was anxiously watched and waited for as the most desired thing at that time was a speedy and safe landing on the supposedly golden beach sands of nome
4858,3235-28433-0048.flac,and the bold dignity and grandeur of the mountains is never diminished by these lesser objects as our ship sailed out into bearing sea we were closely followed by the steamer george w elder whose master
4859,3235-28433-0044.flac,which was one of the commonest slang phrases intended to mean that they had no fault to find with the alaska commercial company and their steamer saint paul all were well cared for and satisfied as well they might be

4861,3235-28433-0030.flac,and hoped they would if that would put an end to their sufferings we tried at last to give them comfort by recommending out of former experiences ship's biscuit dry toast and pop corn as remedies
4862,3235-28433-0036.flac,and we knew we were again at the allusian islands and in the rough waters of unimak pass as we drew nearer and entered the harbor so well land locked the sun dipped low into yellow red western waters
4863,3235-28433-0020.flac,little did i then think that these people placed by a seeming chance in an adjoining stateroom were to be my fellow workers and true friends not only for the coming months in that arctic land to which we were going but
4864,3235-28433-0022.flac,these were men going with all the others to seek their fortunes in the new gold fields working their passage as waiters on the ship to nome where they intended to leave it three evenings in the week these musicians

4867,3235-28433-0027.flac,and a practised clog dancer excited the risibles of the company to the extent that they usually shouted with laughter at his exhibition of flying heels day after day passed
4868,3235-28433-0019.flac,and i found no better or more congenial companions on board the ship than these four honest hard working women so full of hope courage and good sense as well as christianity
4869,3235-28433-0013.flac,a pace which my english friends and others could not follow for they were uncomfortably ill in the region of their digestive apparatus for several days i slept for hours each day and thoroughly enjoyed the trip

4872,3235-28433-0007.flac,and crowded to the utmost capacity for comfort every state room was full each seat at the tables occupied not a foot of space above or below decks was left unused but provision was made for all
4873,3235-28433-0012.flac,not speaking often to strangers but laughing and running away to her mother when addressed from the day we sailed from san francisco until we reached nome i missed no meals in the dining salon
4874,3235-28433-0032.flac,these favorite and much used liquids keeping up a continual swishing in one's interior regions and causing one to truthfully speak of the same as infernal instead of internal
4875,3235-28433-0023.flac,with the help of several singers on board gave concerts in the dining salon which though impromptu were very enjoyable a sweet and trained singer was the english girl of our company
4876,3235-28433-0008.flac,and the ship was well manned i was now much gratified to learn that there were many on board whom i had met before that the steward stewardess and several of the waiters had been on duty on the steamer bertha
4877,3235-28433-0016.flac,one a zealous young woman from san francisco going to the swedish mission at golovin bay this young person was pretty and pleasant and i was glad to make her acquaintance as well as that of three other women speaking the same tongue
4878,3235-28433-0033.flac,but they were all tree physical as well as free moral agents and decided these things for themselves at last we entered the japan current and the weather was warmer and more enjoyable
4879,3235-28433-0031.flac,but only received black looks as our reward we then concluded that a diet of tea coffee and soup was exactly such a one as the fishes would recommend could they speak
4880,3235-28433-0010.flac,four hundred and eighty seven of these thirty five were women there was only one child on board and that was the little black eyed girl with her eskimo mother and white father from golovin bay

4882,3235-28433-0021.flac,as the sequel will show perhaps for years to come not many days had passed when we found that we had on board what few steamers can boast of and that was an orchestra of professional musicians among the waiters
4883,3235-28433-0025.flac,oh where is my wandering boy to night there was not a dry eye in the room and the mind of many a man went back to his old home and praying mother in some far distant state
4884,3235-28433-0029.flac,and it was equally useless to recommend an anicdote for maldemere such as theirs no one was ever so ill before they said they knew they should die and be buried at sea
4885,3235-28433-0011.flac,whom i had seen at saint michael some months before and who was now going back to her northern home she wore a sailor suit of navy blue serge trimmed with white braid and was as coy and cunning as ever
4886,3235-28433-0034.flac,on monday june fourth we saw from the deck a few drifting logs and a quantity of seaweed and these with the presence of gulls and goonies flying overhead convinced us that we were nearing land
4887,3235-28433-0005.flac,when i laughingly called the attention of one of the owners of the ship to the fact that the date fell upon friday and many persons objected to sailing upon that day he postponed the starting of the saint paul to may twenty sixth
4888,3235-28433-0018.flac,and though not related to each other were firm friends of long standing and were uniting their little fortunes in the hope of making greater ones the young missionary was a friend to the other three
4889,3235-28433-0035.flac,we were not mistaken after eating an excellent six o'clock dinner we went above to find ourselves between high rocky cliffs which loomed up into mountains not far distant
4890,3235-28433-0006.flac,and we left the dock on saturday afternoon amid the cheers and handwaving of thousands of people who had come to see the big boat off for nome the steamer was well fitted out spick and span in fresh carpets and paint

4894,3235-28433-0028.flac,those who were continually seasick had diversion enough it was useless for us to tell them a pathetic tale of some one who at some time had been more ill than they because they would not believe a word of it
4895,3235-28433-0002.flac,tens and bedding sufficient to last until some of our numerous plans of work after our arrival brought in returns my hope was to meet my father there for he had written that he thought he should go to the new gold fields
4896,3235-28433-0009.flac,during my trip out from alaska the fall before while i was upon speaking terms with a dozen or more of the passengers with whom i had travelled from the same place of passengers we had all told

4900,3235-28452-0010.flac,there were tiny dishes chairs tables a hundred things dear to a little girl's heart and all pleased her immensely but all were laid quickly aside for a basket of wild flowers or mosses
4901,3235-28452-0013.flac,for which she has a whole heartful of love and the sight of which is better to her than medicine during the month of july we eagerly watched the incoming steamers and welcomed all new comers who landed in chinik
4902,3235-28452-0033.flac,farewell to my white faced friends and to the dark skinned ones
4903,3235-28452-0024.flac,and she like an oasis in a desert place is left here to cheer love and help others many times i have seen evidence of the sweet and gentle influences going out from the life of little yahkuk
4904,3235-28452-0023.flac,and she is surely about to fulfil it born as she was in a rough mining camp at the foot of the barren hills she was given the eskimo name of yahkuk meaning a little hill
4905,3235-28452-0032.flac,so tardy and leaving in summer and to kachaik and chinik whose clear rushing waters so cheered us in springtime farewell to the moss covered hills and paths thickly bordered with blossoms
4906,3235-28452-0005.flac,sleeping during the day and guarding the house nights the heavy iron bracelets in his inner coat pocket weighing scarcely more than the loaded revolver in his belt
4907,3235-28452-0007.flac,and my whole time was given to her before one of the sunny south windows of the living room we placed her cot each morning and here she received her numerous friends both eskimo and white and their names were legion
4908,3235-28452-0018.flac,fresh meats and vegetables we made up for many months of winter dieting all this time i longed to get away i was going each day to the hilltop to watch for the steamers which would bring the letters for which i waited

4912,3235-28452-0001.flac,then came hard rain and wind that for several days blew the ice back into the bay first to one side and then to the other so that the steamers waiting to come in could not do so for fear of the drifting floes
4913,3235-28452-0022.flac,the latter now grown wilful but still so bright and pretty i wanted to take both with me but no i could not the little girl's work was not ended

4929,3235-28452-0021.flac,i was determined to go to saint michael up the yukan to dawsin and outside and laid my plans accordingly
4930,3235-28452-0008.flac,they came from the east west north and south all sorry to know of her illness and bringing presents with them sometimes it was a little live bird or squirrel a delicious salmon trout

4932,39-121915-0017.flac,on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father's assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely
4933,39-121915-0022.flac,when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter missus weston had received
4934,39-121915-0003.flac,miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate
4935,39-121915-0008.flac,she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscomb captain weston who had been considered
4936,39-121915-0013.flac,enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor
4937,39-121915-0001.flac,and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family
4938,39-121915-0005.flac,missus weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit
4939,39-121915-0004.flac,and it took place to the infinite mortification of mister and missus churchill
4940,39-121915-0012.flac,where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realized in easy competence
4941,39-121915-0018.flac,but it was not in mister weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him
4942,39-121915-0027.flac,and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield
4943,39-121915-0014.flac,and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth
4944,39-121915-0025.flac,and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought
4945,39-121915-0006.flac,she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger

4949,39-121915-0016.flac,he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must show him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be
4950,39-121915-0028.flac,her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to missus weston and of moments only of regret an her satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment was so just
4951,39-121915-0010.flac,and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade
4952,39-121915-0011.flac,having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favorable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury
4953,39-121915-0020.flac,but never achieved now upon his father's marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention
4954,39-121915-0031.flac,but never did she go without mister woodhouses giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay
4955,39-121915-0021.flac,either when missus perry drank tea with missus and miss bates or when missus and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mister frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened
4956,39-121915-0023.flac,i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mister frank churchill has written to missus weston
4957,39-121915-0029.flac,and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprise
4958,39-121915-0007.flac,nor from missing the luxuries of her former home
4959,39-121915-0032.flac,there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mister woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over
4960,39-121915-0024.flac,missus weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense
4961,39-121915-0026.flac,but dear emma was of no feeble character
4962,39-121915-0002.flac,and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprised except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend
4963,39-121915-0019.flac,mister frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed
4964,39-121915-0000.flac,but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind
4965,39-121915-0033.flac,but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone
4966,39-121914-0008.flac,the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old
4967,39-121914-0016.flac,and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart in his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony
4968,39-121914-0014.flac,rational or playful the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mister woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits
4969,39-121914-0002.flac,the real evils indeed of emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself
4970,39-121914-0000.flac,emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence
4971,39-121914-0044.flac,mister weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mister weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her death bed
4972,39-121914-0021.flac,when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done
4973,39-121914-0011.flac,which had soon followed isabella's marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent
4974,39-121914-0006.flac,the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mister weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners
4975,39-121914-0036.flac,it must be better to have only one to please than two especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature
4976,39-121914-0054.flac,and this is the only way i have of doing him a service mister elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to show him any attention my dear
4977,39-121914-0045.flac,and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago
4978,39-121914-0053.flac,that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mister elton
4979,39-121914-0004.flac,sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married it was miss taylor's loss which first brought grief
4980,39-121914-0033.flac,i wish you may not catch cold dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them
4981,39-121914-0027.flac,i am sure she will be an excellent servant
4982,39-121914-0043.flac,and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful
4983,39-121914-0039.flac,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mister knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor's advantage
4984,39-121914-0056.flac,i dare say mister knightley will be so kind as to meet him
4985,39-121914-0048.flac,your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mister weston were to marry her
4986,39-121914-0032.flac,mister knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mister woodhouse gratefully observed
4987,39-121914-0037.flac,i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa
4988,39-121914-0051.flac,understanding but in part but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one's family circle grievously
4989,39-121914-0030.flac,was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella's husband he lived about a mile from highbury
4990,39-121914-0012.flac,well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers
4991,39-121914-0007.flac,and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning's work for her
4992,39-121914-0049.flac,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it
4993,39-121914-0001.flac,very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma
4994,39-121914-0028.flac,he will be able to tell her how we all are emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening
4995,39-121914-0005.flac,it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together
4996,39-121914-0047.flac,if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady's mind
4997,39-121914-0052.flac,poor mister elton you like mister elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably
4998,39-121914-0017.flac,being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach
4999,39-121914-0009.flac,how she had devoted all her powers
5000,39-121914-0035.flac,poor mister an miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate
5001,39-121914-0034.flac,i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business
5002,39-121914-0019.flac,but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke
5003,39-121914-0018.flac,through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband
5004,39-121914-0041.flac,and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right
5005,39-121914-0046.flac,and borrowed too umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell's i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa
5006,39-121914-0042.flac,may comfort me for anything mister knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and fortell things for whatever you say always comes to pass
5007,39-121914-0031.flac,was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner
5008,39-121914-0023.flac,but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mister weston ever thought of her
5009,39-121914-0038.flac,what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mister knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it's all a joke
5010,39-121914-0013.flac,only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her
5011,39-121914-0055.flac,ask him to come and dine with us some day
5012,39-121914-0015.flac,for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body
5013,39-121914-0025.flac,you know we have settled all that already
5014,39-121914-0050.flac,and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference
5015,39-121914-0003.flac,these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present so unperceived
5016,39-121914-0029.flac,and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mister knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty
5017,39-121914-0022.flac,as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts
5018,39-121914-0040.flac,she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor's time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision
5019,39-121914-0020.flac,matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection
5020,39-121914-0026.flac,that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her
5021,39-121914-0024.flac,and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own a house of her own but what is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear
5022,39-121914-0010.flac,and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve
5023,39-121916-0004.flac,and missus guddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mister woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses
5024,39-121916-0014.flac,to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen who emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty
5025,39-121916-0030.flac,what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style
5026,39-121916-0009.flac,and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned boarding school where reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price
5027,39-121916-0017.flac,and quite determined to continue the acquaintance she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith's conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy
5028,39-121916-0006.flac,she loved every body was interested in every body's happiness quicksighted to every body's merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother
5029,39-121916-0025.flac,he loved to have the cloth laid
5030,39-121916-0005.flac,for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married miss bate stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself
5031,39-121916-0018.flac,not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing showing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield
5032,39-121916-0012.flac,it was no remedy for the absence of missus weston she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well
5033,39-121916-0001.flac,he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties
5034,39-121916-0000.flac,mister woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter
5035,39-121916-0002.flac,and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him real long standing regard brought the westons and mister knightley
5036,39-121916-0008.flac,and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mister woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip missus godard was the mistress of a school
5037,39-121916-0024.flac,which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal
5038,39-121916-0029.flac,i would not recommend an egg boiled by anybody else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you
5039,39-121916-0031.flac,and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy
5040,39-121916-0011.flac,hung around with fancy work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect
5041,39-121916-0026.flac,and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing
5042,39-121916-0027.flac,such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say
5043,39-121916-0015.flac,a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had placed her several years back at missus guddard's school
5044,39-121916-0022.flac,she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the inn betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which
5045,39-121916-0023.flac,always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit
5046,39-121916-0021.flac,she would form her opinions and her manners it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers
5047,39-121916-0016.flac,she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person
5048,39-121916-0013.flac,but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day
5049,39-121916-0019.flac,and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of everything in so superior a style to which she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given
5050,39-121916-0028.flac,missus bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome
5051,39-121916-0020.flac,those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her
5052,39-121916-0010.flac,for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer
5053,39-121916-0003.flac,and by mister elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mister woodhouse's drawing room
5054,39-121916-0007.flac,and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and graceful spirit were a recommendation to every body
5055,3879-173592-0020.flac,and his tribesmen robbed and maltreated by the lawless soldiers exalted in their miseries yet in these their dark and subtle neighbors was their only hope may day came
5056,3879-173592-0043.flac,waited two days and then descended the river with his prisoner
5057,3879-173592-0024.flac,they were lamentably unfit for the work they had taken in hand our misery says laudonnier was so great that one was found that gathered up all the fishbones that he could find which he dried
5058,3879-173592-0018.flac,and now in ample measure the french began to reap the harvest of their folly conquest gold and military occupation had alone been their aims
5059,3879-173592-0040.flac,those who could bear the weight of their armor put it on embarked to the number of fifty in two barges and sailed up the river under laudonniere himself having reached loutina's landing they marched inland entered his village
5060,3879-173592-0010.flac,the name of the tribe is preserved in that of the river cabusa in close league with him was the mighty owath caqua dwelling near cape canaveral who gave his daughter a maiden of wondrous beauty
5061,3879-173592-0005.flac,married his daughter and in his absence reigned in his stead but as his sway verged towards despotism his subjects took offence and split his head with a hatchet during the winter
5062,3879-173592-0029.flac,could their eyes have pieced the future the indians had left the neighborhood but from time to time brought in meagre supplies of fish which they sold to the famished soldiers at exorbitant prices
5063,3879-173592-0015.flac,with thrice the force demanded three hundred thernagoas and thirty frenchmen took up their march through the pine barrons outina's conjurer was of the number and had well nigh ruined the enterprise
5064,3879-173592-0036.flac,the maze began to ripen and this brought some relief but the indians exasperated and greedy sold it with reluctance and murdered two half famished frenchmen who gathered a handful in the fields
5065,3879-173592-0033.flac,the spring wore away and no relief appeared one thought now engrossed the colonists that of return to france vasseur's ship the breton still remained in the river
5066,3879-173592-0012.flac,in the midst of a lake who put the warriors to flight bore the maidens captive to their watery fastness espoused them all and we are assured
5067,3879-173592-0017.flac,panic slaughter and a plentiful harvest of scalps but no persuasion could induce outina to follow up his victory he went home to dance round his trophies and the french returne disgusted to fort caroline
5068,3879-173592-0038.flac,and sent back empty handed and half starved they returned to the fort in the words of laudonnier angry and pricked deeply to the quick for being so mocked
5069,3879-173592-0039.flac,and joined by all their comrades fiercely demanded to be led against outina to seize him punish his insolence and extort from his fears the supplies which could not be looked for from his gratitude the comacommandant was forced to comply
5070,3879-173592-0042.flac,uttered moans and outcries from the strand yet no ransom was offered since reasoning from their own instincts they never doubted that after the price was paid the captive would be put to death laudonnier
5071,3879-173592-0021.flac,the third anniversary of the day when ribaut and his companions full of delighted anticipation had first explored
5072,3879-173592-0004.flac,and was now a soldier under laudonniere the latter gave him leave to trade with the indians a privilege which he used so well that he grew rich with his traffic became prime favourite with the chief of the island of e delano

5074,3879-173592-0034.flac,and they had also the spanish brigantine brought by the mutineers but these vessels were insufficient and they prepared to build a new one the energy of reviving hope lent new life to their exhausted frames
5075,3879-173592-0009.flac,to hold converse in secret with supernal or infernal powers and each year he sacrificed to his gods one of the spaniards whom the fortune of the sea had cast upon his shores
5076,3879-173592-0023.flac,some were digging roots in the forest or gathering a kind of sorrel upon the meadows if they had had any skill in hunting and fishing the river and the woods would have supplied their needs but in this point as in others
5077,3879-173592-0014.flac,again alluring his greedy allies by the assurance that thus reinforced he would conquer for them a free access to the phantom gold mines of appalache attigny set forth on this fool's errand
5078,3879-173592-0025.flac,and beat into powder to make bread thereof the effects of this hideous famine appeared incontinently among us for our bones eftsoon began to cleave so near unto the skin
5079,3879-173592-0016.flac,with hideous grimaces howlings and contortions he wrought himself into a prophetic frenzy and proclaimed to the astounded warriors
5080,3879-173592-0027.flac,to descry the anxiously expected sail had coligny left them to perish or had some new tempest of calamity let loose upon france drowned the memory of their exile
5081,3879-173592-0000.flac,sagacious bold and restless he pushed his way from town to town and pretended to have reached the mysterious mountains of appalache he sent to the fort mantles woven with feathers quivers covered with choice furs
5082,3879-173592-0019.flac,not a rod of ground had been stirred with the spade their stores were consumed and the expected supplies had not come the indians too were hostile saturiona hated them as allies of his enemies
5083,3879-173592-0031.flac,beyond gun shot waiting for their customers to come out to them oftentimes says laudonnieur our poor soldiers were constrained to give away the very shirts from their backs to get one fish if at any time they shewed unto the savages
5084,3879-173592-0008.flac,filled with treasure gathered from spanish wrecks on adjacent reefs and keys the monarch was a priest too and a magician with power over the elements each year he withdrew from the public gaze
5085,3879-173592-0030.flac,lest they should pay the penalty of their extortion they would not enter the fort

5099,3879-174923-0007.flac,so you're at the old game mister finn said his landlord yes at the old game i suppose it's the same with you now mister bunce had been a very violent politician
5100,3879-174923-0006.flac,he would not even endeavour to think how he might in such case best bestow himself for the present he would remain within the region of politics and live as near as he could to the whirl of the wheel of which the sound was so dear to him
5101,3879-174923-0034.flac,but the ground for that was gone and missus low was no longer painfully severe a few words were said as to his great loss missus low once raised her eyebrows in pretended surprise
5102,3879-174923-0046.flac,poor missus low we can foresee that there is much grief in store for her and some rocks ahead too in the political career of her husband phineas was still in london hanging about the clubs doing nothing

5108,3879-174923-0027.flac,he had left all those things of his own free will as though telling himself that there was a better life than they offered to him but was he sure that he had found it to be better he had certainly sighed for the gods which he had left
5109,3879-174923-0023.flac,alas alas how soon might he now require that money lender's services and then he recollected how he had left these rooms to go into others grander and more appropriate to his life when he had filled high office under the state

5114,3879-174923-0021.flac,which he used to know so well a hundred memories of former days crowded back upon him lord chiltern for a few months had lived with him and then there had arisen a quarrel which he had for a time thought would dissolve his old life into ruin
5115,3879-174923-0065.flac,i complain of no injustice our castle was built upon the sand why should mister kennedy have been a cabinet minister and why should i have been his wife
5116,3879-174923-0036.flac,and if her husband could not be said to live by means of the same atmosphere it was because the breath of his nostrils had been drawn chiefly in the vice chancellor's court in lincoln's inn but he no doubt
5117,3879-174923-0001.flac,it would cost but little and that little should he be successful would fall on the shoulders of mister browborough should he knock off eight votes and lose none himself he would be member for tankerville
5118,3879-174923-0042.flac,it would be my business to do so but i'm not a priest mister low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine and in all friendly observances treated him with due affection but neither did he nor did his wife
5119,3879-174923-0029.flac,would the countess's cards be showered upon him again one card or rather note had reached him while he was yet at tankerville reminding him of old days it was from missus low the wife of the barrister
5120,3879-174923-0032.flac,phineas could not keep himself from feeling that missus low intended to triumph over him but nevertheless he accepted the invitation they were very glad to see him explaining that
5121,3879-174923-0069.flac,thence ought to weigh upon me he has never even told me that he loves me but he is persistent in declaring that those whom god has joined together nothing human should separate
5122,3879-174923-0002.flac,he knew that many votes had been given for browborough which if the truth were known of them would be knocked off and he did not know that the same could be said of any one of those by which he had been supported
5123,3879-174923-0008.flac,pretty much the same mister finn i don't see that things are much better than they used to be they tell me at the people's banner office that the lords have had as much to do with this election as with any that ever went before it
5124,3879-174923-0000.flac,that he should be elected and now he did think it probable that he should get the seat on a petition a scrutiny used to be a very expensive business but under the existing law made as the scrutiny would be in the borough itself
5125,3879-174923-0044.flac,she might have been less loud in expressing her abhorrence of the enemies of the church if she feared nothing why should she scream so loudly between the two he was a good deal crushed and confounded
5126,3879-174923-0043.flac,for a moment abstaind from attacking their guest in respect to his speeches at tankerville it seemed indeed to phineas that as missus low was buckled up in such triple armor that she feared nothing
5127,3879-174923-0050.flac,and when i hear of you at harrington hall i know that you are on your way to the other things do tell me what life is like with oswald and violet of course he never writes he is one of those men who on marrying
5128,3879-174923-0061.flac,to me it is all one tragedy i cannot but think of things as they were two or three years since my father and my husband were both in the cabinet and you young as you were stood but one step below it oswald was out in the cold he was very poor
5129,3879-174923-0016.flac,but after all there's been betwixt you and us it wouldn't be natural to pass it by without one word would it mister finn well yes he's just the same man as ever
5130,3879-174923-0013.flac,the money would come to us to do as we pleased with it we proved all that when we pared them down a bit what's an ecclesiastical commission only another name for a box to put the money into till you want to take it out again
5131,3879-174923-0067.flac,by the gloom of his life i suppose that he lives exclusively at loclinter from time to time i am implored by him to return to my duty beneath his roof he grounds his demand on no affection of his own
5132,3879-174923-0035.flac,when phineas explained that he had thrown up his place and then they settled down on the question of the day and so said missus low you've begun to attack the church it must be remembered that at this moment mister daubeny
5133,3879-174923-0040.flac,you haven't thrown the first stone said mister low but you have taken up the throwing at the first moment in which stones may be dangerous no stones can be dangerous said missus low
5134,3879-174923-0072.flac,though he complains in march we move down south for a couple of months do come if you can most sincerely yours laura kennedy
5135,3879-174923-0045.flac,and missus low was very triumphant when she allowed him to escape from her hands at ten o'clock but at that moment nothing had as yet been heard in baker street of mister daubeny's proposition to the electors of east barsetshire
5136,3879-174923-0026.flac,then he thought of certain special drawing rooms in which wonderful things had been said to him since that he had been a married man and those special drawing rooms and those wonderful words had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife
5137,3879-174923-0004.flac,as for going back to dublin that was now out of the question he had entered upon a feverish state of existence in which it was impossible that he should live in ireland
5138,3879-174923-0020.flac,and keeps hisself but he don't bring home his money nor yet it can't be expected mister finn i know what the young uns will do and what they won't and mary jane is quite handy about the house now only she do break things
5139,3879-174923-0005.flac,he must vanish out of the world
5140,3879-174923-0033.flac,as nobody was supposed to be in town nobody had been asked to meet him in former days he had been very intimate in that house having received from both of them much kindness mingled perhaps with some touch of severity on the part of the lady
5141,3879-174923-0064.flac,he won his wife honestly did he not and he has ever been honest it is my pride to think i never gave him up but the bitter part of my cup consists in this that as he has won what he has deserved so have we
5142,3879-174923-0068.flac,on no presumption that any affection can remain with me he says no word of happiness he offers no comfort he does not attempt to persuade with promises of future care he makes his claim simply on holy writ and on the feeling of duty which
5143,3879-174923-0028.flac,while his young wife was living he had kept his sizes down so that she should not hear them but he had been forced to acknowledge that his new life had been vapid and flavourless now he had been tempted back again to the old haunts
5144,3879-174923-0071.flac,to be able to talk again to one who knows all the errors and all the efforts of my past life as you do dresden is very cold in the winter i do not know whether you would mind that we are very particular about the rooms but my father bears the temperature wonderfully well
5145,3879-174923-0052.flac,as the wife of a master of hounds
5146,3879-174923-0057.flac,we certainly did not think that you would come out strong against the church
5147,3879-174923-0047.flac,discussing mister daubeny's wonderful treachery with such men as came up to town and waiting for the meeting of parliament when he received the following letter from lady laura kennedy dresden november eighteenth
5148,3879-174923-0018.flac,that i don't know how to bear it well yes that is true mister finn there never was a man better at bringing home his money to his wife than bunce
5149,3879-174923-0058.flac,but if it must come why not by your hands as well as by any other it is hardly possible that you in your heart should love a protestant ascendant church but as barrington says a horse won't get oats
5150,3879-174923-0039.flac,i am afraid that missus low when she allowed herself to speak thus energetically entertain some confused idea that the church of england and the christian religion were one and the same thing or at least that they had been brought into the world together
5151,3879-174923-0012.flac,but when we read of churches as is called state churches churches as have bishops you and i have to pay for as never goes in to them but we don't pay the bishops mister bunce oh yes we do because of they wasn't paid
5152,3879-174923-0010.flac,not but what he's disgraced himself by what he's been and done now mister slide in former days had been the editor of the people's banner
5153,3879-174923-0009.flac,perhaps they don't know much about it at the people's banner office i thought mister slide and the people's banner had gone over to the other side bunce mister slide is pretty wide awake whatever side is on
5154,3879-174923-0049.flac,than that you should be living in dublin i cannot conceive of you as living any other life than that of the house of commons downing street and the clubs nor do i wish to do so
5155,3879-174923-0062.flac,papa thought all evil of him violet had refused him over and over again he quarrelled with you and all the world seemed against him then of a sudden you vanished and we vanished an ineffable misery fell upon me and upon my wretched husband
5156,3879-174923-0022.flac,now lord chiltern was again his very intimate friend and there had used to sit a needy money lender who
5157,3879-174923-0017.flac,just as he used to and never got so much out of it
5158,3879-174923-0056.flac,he declares that mister browborough is almost disposed not to fight the battle though a man more disposed to fight never bribed an elector but barrington seems to think that you managed as well as you did by getting outside the traces as he calls it
5159,3879-174923-0048.flac,i have heard with great pleasure from my sister in law that you have been staying with them at harrington hall it seems so like old days that you and oswald and violet should be together so much more natural
5160,3879-174923-0030.flac,with whom he had worked when he had been a law student in london she had asked him to come and dine with them after the old fashion in baker street naming a day as to which she presumed that he would by that time have finished his affairs at tankerville
5161,3879-174923-0066.flac,there is no one whom i can ask to tell me of him that he did not attend during the last session i do know and we presume that he has now abandoned his seat i fear that his health is bad
5162,3879-174923-0019.flac,if he drink it which he never does i think i'd bear it better than give it to that nasty union and young jack writes as well as his father pretty nigh mister finn which is a comfort mister bunce was a journeyman scrivener at a law stationer's
5163,3879-174923-0070.flac,i have told papa that i should ask you and he would be delighted
5164,3879-174923-0063.flac,all our good things went from us at a blow i and my poor father became as it were outcasts but oswold suddenly retricked his beams and is flaming in the forehead of the morning sky he i believe
5165,3879-174923-0031.flac,intimating also that mister low would then have finished his at north broughton now mister low had sat for north broughton before phineas left london and his wife spoke of the seat as a certainty
5166,3879-174923-0024.flac,would there ever again come to him such cause for migration and would he again be able to load the frame of the looking glass over the fire with countless cards from countesses and ministers wives he had opened the oyster for himself once
5167,3879-174923-0059.flac,at home as you know not only did he take an active part in politics but he was active also in the management of his own property now it seems to him to be almost too great a trouble to write a letter to his steward
5168,3879-174923-0053.flac,as the art is real she told me how poor dear lady baldock communicated to you her unhappiness about her daughter in a manner that made even me laugh and would make thousands laugh in days to come were it ever to be published
5169,3879-174923-0041.flac,the idea of a state church said phineas is opposed to my theory of political progress what i hope is that my friends will not suppose that i attack the protestant church because i am a roman catholic if i were a priest
5170,3879-174923-0037.flac,would be very much disturbed indeed should he ever be told that he was required as an expectant member of mister daubeny's party to vote for the disestablishment
5171,3879-174923-0011.flac,but what a man keeps in the way of religion for his own use is never nothing to me as what i keeps is nothing to him i'm afraid you don't keep much mister bunce and that's nothing to you neither is it sir no indeed
5172,887-123289-0017.flac,after having risked blowing up during the storm well cried the professor as we have no guns we cannot hunt that's all yes but how about the instruments here is the aneroid the most useful of all
5173,887-123289-0002.flac,then he returned to the rocks against which the furious waves were beating to save what he could i was unable to speak i was shattered with fatigue and excitement
5174,887-123289-0034.flac,well replied my uncle we may easily ascertain this by consulting the compass let us go and see what it says the professor moved toward the rock upon which hans had laid down the instruments
5175,887-123289-0006.flac,and that i was only just coming down to breakfast and that i was to be married to greben that day alas if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east we should have passed under germany under my beloved town of homburg
5176,887-123289-0025.flac,i don't think we shall come out by the way that we went in i stared at the professor with a good deal of mistrust i asked was he not touched in the brain and yet there was method in his madness and now let us go to breakfast said he
5177,887-123289-0016.flac,and had saved the most precious of the articles at the risk of his life not that we had suffered no losses for instance our firearms but we might do without them our stock of powder had remained uninjured
5178,887-123289-0005.flac,the exhilarating voice of the professor fell upon my ears as i awoke he was ominously cheerful well my boy he cried have you slept well
5179,887-123289-0022.flac,four months cried the professor we have time to go and to return
5180,887-123289-0027.flac,after the commotions we had gone through all contributed to give me a good appetite whilst breakfasting i took the opportunity to put to my uncle the question where we were now that seems to me i said rather difficult to make out
5181,887-123289-0020.flac,there was no denying it we had all our instruments as for tools and appliances there they all lay on the ground ladders ropes picks spades et cetera still there was the question of provisions to be settled and i asked
5182,887-123289-0015.flac,on my arrival on the shore i found hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good order my uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude this man with almost superhuman devotion
5183,887-123289-0033.flac,perhaps we have deviated no i think not
5184,887-123289-0032.flac,that is a good long way my friend but whether we are under turkey or the atlantic depends very much on the question
5185,887-123289-0000.flac,what happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than i can tell i felt myself hurled into the waves and if i escaped from death and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks
5186,887-123289-0007.flac,under the very street where dwelt all that i loved most in the world then only forty leagues would have separated us but they were forty leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall and in reality we were a thousand leagues asunder
5187,887-123289-0029.flac,the last observation i remarked was made on the island where the geyser was you mean axel island don't decline the honor of having given your name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the globe well said i
5188,887-123289-0031.flac,surely axel it may vie in size with the mediterranean itself especially i replied if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part and it is a curious circumstance i added that if my computations are right
5189,887-123289-0018.flac,and for which i would have given all the others by means of it i can calculate the depth and know when we have reached the centre without it
5190,887-123289-0037.flac,and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery what is the matter i asked
5191,887-123289-0038.flac,an exclamation of astonishment burst from me the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea i shook the box examined it again
5192,887-123289-0035.flac,he was gay and full of spirits he rubbed his hands he studied his attitudes i followed him curious to know if i was right in my estimate as soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle took the compass laid it horizontally
5193,887-123289-0021.flac,how are we off for provisions the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore in a perfect state of preservation for the most part the sea had spared them and what with biscuits salt meat spirits and salt fish
5194,887-123289-0011.flac,i only want to know how that is to be managed in the simplest way possible when we have reached the centre of the globe either we shall find some new way to get back or we shall come back like decent folks the way we came
5195,887-123289-0028.flac,yes it is difficult he said to calculate exactly perhaps even impossible since during these three stormy days i have been unable to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft but still we may get an approximation
5196,887-123289-0023.flac,i ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's ways yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me now said he
5197,887-123289-0039.flac,it was in perfect condition in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter
5198,887-123289-0014.flac,we left this grotto which lay open to every wind at the same time i cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well it seemed to me impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have destroyed everything on board
5199,887-123289-0036.flac,and questioned the needle which after a few oscillations presently assumed a fixed position my uncle looked and looked and looked again he rubbed his eyes
5200,887-123289-0019.flac,such high spirits as these were rather too strong but where is the compass i asked here it is upon this rock in perfect condition as well as the thermometers and the chronometer the hunter is a splendid fellow
5201,887-123289-0001.flac,it was because the powerful arm of hans came to my rescue the brave icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves over a burning sand where i found myself by the side of my uncle
5202,887-123289-0013.flac,yes to be sure we have hans is a clever fellow and i am sure he must have saved a large part of our cargo but still let us go and make sure
5203,887-123289-0010.flac,but my dear uncle do let me ask you one question of course axel how about returning returning why you are talking about the return before the arrival no
5204,887-123289-0004.flac,the next day the weather was splendid the sky and the sea had sunk into sudden repose every trace of the awful storm had disappeared
5205,887-123289-0024.flac,therefore we shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst as for the raft i will recommend hans to do his best to repair it although i don't expect it will be of any further use to us how so i cried an idea of my own my lad
5206,887-123289-0009.flac,i am only a little knocked up but i shall soon be better oh said my uncle that's nothing to signify you are only a little bit tired but you uncle you seem in very good spirits this morning
5207,887-123289-0012.flac,i feel pleased at the thought that it is sure not to be shut against us but then we shall have to refit the raft of course then as to provisions have we enough to last
5208,887-123289-0003.flac,i wanted a whole hour to recover even a little but a deluge of rain was still falling though with that violence which generally denotes the near cessation of a storm
5209,887-123289-0026.flac,i followed him to a headland after he had given his instructions to the hunter there preserved meat biscuits and tea made us an excellent meal one of the best i ever remember hunger the fresh air the calm quiet weather
5210,887-123289-0030.flac,let it be axel island then we had cleared two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were six hundred leagues from iceland very well answered my uncle let us start from that point and count four days storm
5211,887-123289-0008.flac,all these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before i could answer my uncle's question well now he repeated won't you tell me how you have slept oh very well i said
5212,887-123291-0038.flac,considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth the long continued cooling of the globe produced chasms fissures clefts and faults into which very probably portions of the upper earth may have fallen
5213,887-123291-0002.flac,near abeville in the department of some found a human jawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface it was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light not far distant
5214,887-123291-0024.flac,in the eighteenth century i would have stood up for scheuzer's pre adamite man against peter campit i have perused a writing
5215,887-123291-0008.flac,of certain grottoes in france switzerland and belgium as well as weapons tools earthen utensils bones of children and adults the existence therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more certain
5216,887-123291-0041.flac,in fact it was a wonderful spectacle that of these generations of men and animals commingled in a common cemetery then one very serious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest
5217,887-123291-0014.flac,preserved it thus for so many ages it might be so but this dried corpse with its parchment like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame the limbs still preserving their shape sound teeth abundant hair
5218,887-123291-0005.flac,therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent
5219,887-123291-0028.flac,have recognized in these bones nothing more remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the post tertiary period but in the presence of this specimen to doubt would be to insult science there stands the body you may see it touch it
5220,887-123291-0009.flac,nor was this all fresh discoveries of remains in the pleocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still it is true that these remains were not human bones
5221,887-123291-0017.flac,otto liedenbrock yielding to his nature forgot all the circumstances of our eventful journey forgot where we were standing forgot the vaulted cavern which contained us no doubt he was in mind back again in his johanneum
5222,887-123291-0010.flac,but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork such as fossil leg bones of animals sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man
5223,887-123291-0021.flac,the pretended body of orestes claimed to have been found by the spartans and of the body of asterius ten cubits long
5224,887-123291-0023.flac,you know as well as i do gentlemen the analysis made at luscerne in fifteen seventy seven of those huge bones which the celebrated doctor felix plater affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen feet high
5225,887-123291-0019.flac,eminent geologists have denied his existence others no less eminent have affirmed it the saint thomasis of paleontology if they were here might now touch him with their fingers and would be obliged to acknowledge their error
5226,887-123291-0015.flac,and finger and toe nails of frightful length this desicated mummy startled us by appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago i stood mute before this apparition of remote antiquity my uncle usually so garrulous
5227,887-123291-0042.flac,had all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust of the earth down to the shores of the liedenbroc sea when they were dead and turning to dust or had they lived and grown and died here in this subterranean world under a false sky
5228,887-123291-0027.flac,it was not to be done the unlucky word would not come out at the johannium there would have been a laugh giganto osteology at last the professor burst out between two words which i shall not record here
5229,887-123291-0030.flac,i was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion if i could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid pursued my uncle i should be able to clear it from all the earthly particles and the shells which are incrusted about it
5230,887-123291-0020.flac,i am quite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of this kind i know what capital enterprising individuals like barnum have made out of fossil men i have heard the tale of the knee pan of ajax
5231,887-123291-0022.flac,i have read the reports of the skeleton of trapani found in the fourteenth century and which was at the time identified as that of polyphemus and the history of the giant unearthed in the sixteenth century near palermo
5232,887-123291-0026.flac,he could get no further
5233,887-123291-0031.flac,but i do not possess that valuable solvent yet such as it is the body shall tell us its own wonderful story here the professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton and handled it with the skill of a dexterous showman
5234,887-123291-0025.flac,here my uncle's unfortunate infirmity met him that of being unable in public to pronounce hard words
5235,887-123291-0007.flac,we knew all these details but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages other similar maxillaries though belonging to individuals of various types and different nations were found in the loose grey soil
5236,887-123291-0004.flac,saw at once the importance of this discovery proved to demonstration the genuineness of the bone in question and became the most ardent defendants in what the english called this trial of a jawbone
5237,887-123291-0016.flac,was struck dumb likewise we raised the body we stood it up against a rock it seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits we sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame after some moment's silence the professor was himself again
5238,887-123291-0018.flac,holding forth to his pupils for he assumed his learned air and addressing himself to an imaginary audience he proceeded thus gentlemen i have the honor to introduce to you a man of the quaternary or posttertiary system
5239,887-123291-0033.flac,it is evidently caucasian it is the white race our own the skull of this fossil is a regular oval or rather ovoid it exhibits no prominent cheek bones no projecting jaws
5240,887-123291-0040.flac,the fossil body was not the only one in this immense catacomb we came upon other bodies at every step amongst this mortal dust and my uncle might select the most curious of these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics
5241,887-123291-0003.flac,were found stone hatchets and flint arrowheads stained and encased by lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust the noise of this discovery was very great not in france alone but in england and in germany
5242,887-123291-0001.flac,in a paleontological point of view which had occurred a little while before our departure on the twenty eighth of march eighteen sixty three
5243,887-123291-0011.flac,he was a predecessor of the mastodon he was a contemporary of the southern elephant he lived a hundred thousand years ago when according to geologists the pliocine formation was in progress
5244,887-123291-0039.flac,but there is the man surrounded by his own works by hatchets by flint arrow heads
5245,887-123291-0006.flac,and agreeing in that with couvier he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the caternary period my uncle liedenbrock along with the great body of the geologists had maintained his ground disputed and argued until
5246,887-123291-0013.flac,twenty yards farther on he found himself face to face with a primitive man it was a perfectly recognizable human body had some particular soil like that of the cemetery saintmichel at bordeaux
5247,887-123291-0037.flac,how those strata on which he lay slipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe i confess i cannot answer that question
5248,887-123291-0035.flac,it is nearly ninety degrees but i will go further in my deductions and i will affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the japhetic race which has since spread from the indies to the atlantic don't smile gentlemen nobody was smiling
5249,887-123291-0029.flac,it is not a mere skeleton it is an entire body
5250,887-123291-0032.flac,you see he said that it is not six feet long and that we are still separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants
5251,887-123291-0036.flac,but the learned professor was frequently disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities yes he pursued with animation this is a fossil man the contemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre
5252,887-123291-0034.flac,it presents no appearance of that prognithism
5253,887-123291-0000.flac,chapter thirty eight the professor in his chair again to understand this apostrophe of my uncle's made to absent french savance it will be necessary to allude to an event of high importance
5254,887-123291-0012.flac,such then was the state of paleontological science and what we knew of it was sufficient to explain our behavior in the presence of this stupendous golgotha any one may now understand the frenzied excitement of my uncle when
5255,887-123290-0002.flac,erect upon the rock angry and threatening otto liedenbrock was a rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce achilles defying the lightning but i thought it my duty to interpose an attempt to lay some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism
5256,887-123290-0012.flac,i will not leave it until i have examined it to understand what followed it must be borne in mind that
5257,887-123290-0025.flac,but an impatient curiosity impelled our steps crackling and rattling our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric animals and interesting fossils the possession of which is a matter of rivalry and contention
5258,887-123290-0003.flac,just listen to me i said firmly ambition must have a limit somewhere we cannot perform impossibilities we are not at all fit for another sea voyage who would dream of undertaking a voyage of five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks
5259,887-123290-0014.flac,the space between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable it took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock we trampled under our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed in the earliest ages of the world
5260,887-123290-0015.flac,i also saw immense carapaces more than fifteen feet in diameter
5261,887-123290-0018.flac,this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within the interior of the earth and it certainly had its origin in the waters of the ocean overhead which had made their way hither through some fissure yet
5262,887-123290-0031.flac,he laid his hand upon a bare skull and cried with a voice trembling with excitement axel axel a human head a human skull i cried no less astonished
5263,887-123290-0008.flac,a sail already hung from the new mast and the wind was playing in its waving folds the professor said a few words to the guide and immediately he put everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure
5264,887-123290-0007.flac,hans was finishing the repairs of the raft one would have thought that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions with a few more pieces of surtubrand he had refitted our vessel
5265,887-123290-0001.flac,shall fire air and water make a combined attack against me well they shall know what a determined man can do i will not yield i will not stir a single foot backwards and it will be seen whether man or nature is to have the upper hand
5266,887-123290-0028.flac,leptotheria mericotheria lophiodia anplotheria megatheria mastodons protopithace pteradactyls and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction
5267,887-123290-0029.flac,fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandran library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle professor liedenbrock
5268,887-123290-0026.flac,a thousand couviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection i stood amazed my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky
5269,887-123290-0019.flac,it must be believed that the fissure is now closed and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a very short time perhaps even this water subjected to the fierce action of central heat had partly been resolved into vapor
5270,887-123290-0005.flac,i was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten minutes without interruption not that the professor was paying any respectful attention to his nephew's arguments but because he was deaf to all my eloquence
5271,887-123290-0022.flac,wherever he saw a hole he always wanted to know the depth of it to him this was important we had traversed the shores of the liedenbrock sea for a mile when we observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil it seemed upset contorted
5272,887-123290-0000.flac,we had gone backwards instead of forwards but my uncle rapidly recovered himself aha will fate play tricks upon me will the elements lay plots against me
5273,887-123290-0017.flac,the waves had left manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone this might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe but in my opinion
5274,887-123290-0027.flac,his mouth gaping wide his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles his head balancing with an up and down motion his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered
5275,887-123290-0024.flac,haze there within three square miles were accumulated the materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages a history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited world
5276,887-123290-0030.flac,but more was to come when
5277,887-123290-0010.flac,the icelander seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget and deny himself i could get nothing out of a servant so feutilized as it were to his master my only course was to proceed
5278,887-123290-0016.flac,and ridged up in successive lines i was therefore led to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the ground on which we were treading on the loose and scattered rocks
5279,887-123290-0013.flac,we were not really where the professor supposed we were in fact we were not upon the north shore of the sea now let us start upon fresh discoveries i said and leaving hans to his work we started off together
5280,887-123290-0021.flac,fixed physical laws will or may always explain them we were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil the deposits of the waters of former ages the professor was carefully examining every little fissure in the rocks
5281,887-123290-0009.flac,the air was clear and the north west wind blew steadily what could i do could i stand against the two it was impossible if hans had but taken my side but no it was not to be
5282,887-123290-0011.flac,i was therefore going with as much resignation as i could find to resume my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle laid his hand upon my shoulder we shall not sail until to morrow he said
5283,887-123290-0006.flac,to the raft he shouted such was his only reply it was no use for me to entreat supplicate get angry or do anything else in the way of opposition
5284,887-123290-0023.flac,where the remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together huge mounds of bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance they undulated away to the limits of the horizon and melted in the distance in a faint
5285,887-123290-0020.flac,and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests within the bowels of the earth this theory of the phenomenon we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to me for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature
5286,887-123290-0004.flac,with a blanket in rags for a sail a stick for a mast and fierce winds in our teeth we cannot steer we shall be buffeted by the tempests and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time
5287,3436-172162-0029.flac,then sir gawaine said surely it is unworthy of a knight to travel in such sort but sir launcelot heeded him not at knightfall
5288,3436-172162-0040.flac,consulting his ring and finding that this was an enchantment he burst his chains seized his armor in spite of the visionary monsters who attempted to defend it broke open the gates of the tower and continued his journey
5289,3436-172162-0024.flac,alas for shame said sir launcelot that ever one knight should betray another but it is an old saw a good man is never in danger but when he is in danger of a coward
5290,3436-172162-0015.flac,for he dreaded lest sir launcelot should have knowledge of what had been done then the queen privily called unto her a page of her chamber that was swiftly horsed to whom she said go thou when thou seest thy time
5291,3436-172162-0039.flac,after an easy victory only doomed him to be carted in his turn at night he was received at another castle with great apparent hospitality but found himself in the morning in a dungeon and loaded with chains
5292,3436-172162-0027.flac,that he should take him in and convey him as speedily as possible for a liberal reward the carter consented and sir launcelot placed himself in the cart and only lamented that with much jolting he made but little progress
5293,3436-172162-0007.flac,but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for maying so he prepared him twenty men of arms and a hundred archers to take captive the queen and her knights
5294,3436-172162-0018.flac,then they that were best horsed chased him and shot at him but the child went from them all then sir maleagans said to the queen madam ye are about to betray me but i shall arrange for sir launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you
5295,3436-172162-0030.flac,but to admit his companion whom she supposed to be a criminal or at least a prisoner it pleased her not
5296,3436-172162-0025.flac,then sir launcelot went awhile and he was exceedingly cumbered by his armor his shield and his spear and all that belonged to him then by chance there came by him a cart that came thither to fetch wood
5297,3436-172162-0021.flac,unless i may rescue that noble lady then eagerly he asked his armor and put it on him and mounted his horse and rode as fast as he might
5298,3436-172162-0006.flac,son to king bradamagus who loved queen guenvere passing well and so had he done long and many years now this knight sir maleagans learned the queen's purpose and that she had no men of arms with her
5299,3436-172162-0020.flac,and the child came to westminster and found sir launcelot and told his message and delivered him the queen's ring alas said sir launcelot
5300,3436-172162-0034.flac,sir launcelot found his way beset with obstacles which he encountered successfully but not without much loss of time as evening approached he was met by a young and sportive damsel who gayly proposed to him a supper
5301,3436-172162-0023.flac,and they shot at him and smote his horse so that he fell then sir launcelot left his horse and went on foot but there lay so many ditches and hedges betwixt the archers and him that he might not meddle with them
5302,3436-172162-0045.flac,ah launcelot my knight truly have i been told that thou art no longer worthy of me these words instantly revived the drooping knight he resumed at once his usual superiority and soon laid at his feet his haughty adversary
5303,3436-172162-0046.flac,moved by the entreaties of bradamagus ordered him to withhold the blow and he obeyed the castle and its prisoners were now at his disposal launcelot hastened to the apartment of the queen threw himself at her feet
5304,3436-172162-0032.flac,neither would the damsels prepare a bed for him he seized the first he found unoccupied and was left undisturbed next morning he saw from the turrets of the castle a train accompanying a lady whom he imagined to be the queen
5305,3436-172162-0036.flac,suddenly the scene changed and he was assailed by six furious ruffians whom he dealt with so vigorously that most of them were speedily disabled when again there was a change and he found himself alone with his fair hostess
5306,3436-172162-0000.flac,the adventure of the cart it befell in the month of may queen guenever called to her knights of the table round and gave them warning that early upon the morrow she would ride a maying into the woods and fields beside westminster
5307,3436-172162-0044.flac,and under the eyes of the fair captive launcelot was enfeebled by his wounds and fought not with his usual spirit and the contest for a time was doubtful
5308,3436-172162-0048.flac,for her lover suddenly started from her and bitterly lamenting that he had incurred the displeasure of his sovereign lady rushed out of the castle threw his sword and his shield to the right and left ran furiously into the woods and disappeared
5309,3436-172162-0047.flac,and was about to kiss her hand when she exclaimed ah launcelot why do i see thee again yet feel thee to be no longer worthy of me after having been disgracefully drawn about the country in a she had not time to finish the phrase
5310,3436-172162-0049.flac,it seems that the story of the abominable cart which haunted launcelot at every step had reached the ears of sir kay who hid told it to the queen as a proof that her knight must have been dishonoured
5311,3436-172162-0038.flac,who all seemed to have learned by some means his disgraceful drive in the cart one more insolent than the rest had the audacity to interrupt him during dinner and even to risk a battle in support of his pleasantry launcelot
5312,3436-172162-0051.flac,and that it was his duty to set her right he therefore returned compelled maleagans to release his prisoners
5313,3436-172162-0016.flac,and bar this ring unto sir launcelot and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescue me and spare not thy horse said the queen neither for water nor for land
5314,3436-172162-0035.flac,at her castle the knight who was hungry and weary accepted the offer though with no very good grace he followed the lady to her castle and ate voraciously of her supper but was quite impenetrable to all her amorous advances
5315,3436-172162-0043.flac,offered him his assistance and informed him that the queen was safe in his castle but could only be rescued by encountering maleagans launcelot demanded the battle for the next day and accordingly it took place at the foot of the tower
5316,3436-172162-0052.flac,had the satisfaction of meeting him the next day
5317,3436-172162-0008.flac,in the merry month of may in a morn at break of day with a troop of damsels playing the queen forsooth went forth a maying old song so when the queen had mayd
5318,3436-172162-0004.flac,sir dodinas le savage sir osanna sir ladinas sir persant of ind sir ironside and sir pellias and these ten knights made them ready
5319,3436-172162-0050.flac,three days elapsed during which launcelot wandered without knowing where he went till at last he began to reflect that his mistress had doubtless been deceived by misrepresentation
5320,3436-172162-0037.flac,which she told him would by its changes of color disclosed to him all enchantments and enable him to subdue them sir launcelot pursued his journey without being much incommoded except by the taunts of travellers
5321,3436-172162-0003.flac,so they made them ready and these were the names of the knights sir kay the seneschal sir agrivaine sir brandiles sir sagramore le desurus
5322,3436-172162-0005.flac,so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen and rode a maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them in great joy and delight now there was a knight
5323,3436-172162-0012.flac,then they lashed together with swords till several were smitten to the earth so when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully oppressed and needs must be slain at the last then for pity and sorrow she cried sir maleagans
5324,3436-172162-0028.flac,he drew nearer to see who it might be then sir launcelot told him how the queen had been carried off and how in hastening to her rescue his horse had been disabled and he had been compelled to avail himself of the cart rather than give up his enterprise
5325,3436-172162-0017.flac,and lightly he took his horse with the spurs and departed as fast as he might and when sir maleagan saw him so flee he understood that it was by the queen's commandment for to warn sir launcelot
5326,3436-172162-0011.flac,then the ten knights of the round table drew their swords and the other party run at them with their spears
5327,3436-172162-0031.flac,at supper sir launcelot came near being consigned to the kitchen
5328,3436-172162-0001.flac,and i warn ye that there be none of you but he be well horsed and that ye all be clothed in green either silk or cloth and i shall bring with me ten ladies and every knight shall have a lady behind him
5329,3436-172162-0014.flac,madam said maleagans for your sake they shall be led with you into my own castle if that ye will be ruled and ride with me then sir maleagans charged them all that none should depart from the queen
5330,3436-172162-0019.flac,then he rode with her and them all to his castle in all the haste that they might and by the way sir maleagans laid in ambush the best archers that he had to wait for sir launcelot
5331,3436-172162-0041.flac,at length his progress was checked by a wide and rapid torrent which could only be passed on a narrow bridge on which a false step would prove his destruction launcelot leading his horse by the bridle and making him swim by his side
5332,3436-172162-0013.flac,slay not my noble knights and i will go with you upon this covenant that
5333,3436-172162-0009.flac,traitor knight said queen guenever what wilt thou do wilt thou shame thyself bethink thee how thou art a king's son and a knight of the table round and how thou art about to dishonour all knighthood and thyself
5334,3436-172162-0026.flac,carts were little used except for carrying offl and for conveying criminals to execution but sir launcelot took no thought of anything but the necessity of haste for the purpose of rescuing the queen so he demanded of the carter
5335,3436-172162-0002.flac,and every knight shall have a squire and two ye omen and all well horsed for thus it chanced one morn when all the court green suited but with plumes that mocked the may had been their wont a maying
5336,3436-172162-0033.flac,the lady of the castle supplied sir launcelot with a horse and they traversed the plain at full speed they learned from some travellers whom they met that there were two roads which led to the castle of sir maleagans here therefore the friends separated
5337,3436-172162-0010.flac,be it as it may said sir maleagans know you well madam i have loved you many a year and never till now could i get you to such advantage as i do now and therefore i will take you as i find you
5338,3436-172162-0022.flac,and men say he took the water at westminster bridge and made his horse swim over thames unto lambeth then within a while he came to a wood where was a narrow way and there the archers were laid in ambush
5339,3436-172162-0042.flac,passed over the bridge and was attacked as soon as he reached the bank by a lion and a leopard both of which he slew and then exhausted and bleeding seated himself on the grass and endeavored to bind up his wounds
5340,3436-172171-0025.flac,that she fell senseless to the ground then said kay to perceval go after the knight who went hence to the meadow overthrow him and recover the golden goblet and possess thyself of his horse and arms and thou shalt have knighthood
5341,3436-172171-0052.flac,and who he was but perceval was so intent upon his thought that he gave him no answer then the youth thrust at perceval with his lance and perceval turned upon him and struck him to the ground
5342,3436-172171-0064.flac,gladly will i do so answered perceval so they went together to arthur and saluted him
5343,3436-172171-0027.flac,didst thou see any one coming after me from the court
5344,3436-172171-0018.flac,perceval entered the hall upon the bony pie bald horse with his uncouth trappings in the centre of the hall stood kay the senechal tell me tall man said perceval is that arthur yonder
5345,3436-172171-0000.flac,where he was brought up in total ignorance of arms and chivalry he was allowed no weapon
5346,3436-172171-0023.flac,till she had seen him who would be the flower of chivalry now this damsel came up to perceval and told him smiling that if he lived he would be one of the bravest and best of knights truly said kay
5347,3436-172171-0034.flac,sir owain unfastened the armor and helped perceval to put it on and taught him how to put his foot in the stirrup and use the spur
5348,3436-172171-0003.flac,he said to his mother mother what are those yonder they are angels my son said she by my faith i will go and become an angel with them and perceval went to the road and met them
5349,3436-172171-0037.flac,went back to the court and related all these things to arthur and guenever and to all the household
5350,3436-172171-0054.flac,and perceval thrust at him with his lance and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade and while he lay thus stunned his horse returned back in a wild and prancing pace then said
5351,3436-172171-0047.flac,perceval entered a valley and came to a hermit's cell and the hermit welcomed him gladly and there he spent the night and in the morning he arose and when he went forth behold a shower of snow had fallen in the night and a hawk
5352,3436-172171-0043.flac,if thou seest aught to cause thy wonder ask not the meaning of it if no one has the courtesy to inform thee the reproach will not fall upon thee but upon me that am thy teacher
5353,3436-172171-0006.flac,and perceval in return gave him such information as he had then perceval returned to his mother and said to her mother those were not angels but honorable knights then his mother swooned away
5354,3436-172171-0014.flac,and he gave the maiden his own ring in exchange for hers then he mounted his horse and rode away perceval journeyed on till he arrived at arthur's court and it so happened
5355,3436-172171-0061.flac,and truly he is the knight who fought with thee last verily said perceval i am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the smiling maiden then perceval told him his name and said
5356,3436-172171-0042.flac,footnote the word means both fisher and sinner thou shalt remain with me a space in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries and courtesy and noble bearing and this do thou remember
5357,3436-172171-0004.flac,tell me good lad said one of them sawest thou a knight pass this way either to day or yesterday
5358,3436-172171-0032.flac,verily said sir owain the son of urian to kay the seneschal thou wast ill advised to send that madman after the knight for he must either be overthrown or flee and either way it will be a disgrace to arthur and his warriors
5359,3436-172171-0049.flac,to the hair of the lady that best he loved which was blacker than jet and to her skin which was whiter than the snow and to the two red spots upon her cheeks which were redder than the blood upon the snow
5360,3436-172171-0033.flac,therefore will i go to see what has befallen him so sir owain went to the meadow and he found perceval trying in vain to get the dead knight's armor off in order to clothe himself with it
5361,3436-172171-0024.flac,thou art ill taught to remain a year at arthur's court with choice of society and smile on no one and now before the face of arthur and all his knights to call such a man as this the flower of knighthood
5362,3436-172171-0065.flac,him whom thou hast sought so long welcome unto thee chieftain said arthur and hereupon there came the queen and her handmaidens and perceval saluted them and they were rejoiced to see him and bade him welcome
5363,3436-172171-0050.flac,now arthur and his household were in search of perceval and by chance they came that way know ye said arthur who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook up yonder lord said one of them
5364,3436-172171-0048.flac,had killed a wild fowl in front of the cell and the noise of the horse had scared the hawk away and a raven alighted on the bird and perceval stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the snow
5365,3436-172171-0028.flac,and to take from thee the goblet and thy horse and armour for myself silence said the knight go back to the court and tell arthur either to come himself
5366,3436-172171-0031.flac,my mother's servants were not used to play with me in this wise so thus will i play with thee and he threw at him one of his sharp pointed sticks and it struck him in the eye and came out at the back of his head so that he fell down lifeless
5367,3436-172171-0012.flac,perceiving in one corner of the tent some food two flasks full of wine and some boars flesh roasted he said my mother told me whenever i saw meat and drink to take it
5368,3436-172171-0013.flac,and he ate greedily for he was very hungry the maiden said sir thou haddest best go quickly from here for fear that my friends should come and evil should befall you but perceval said
5369,3436-172171-0017.flac,for it seemed to them that no one would have ventured on so daring an outrage unless he possessed such powers through magic or charms that none could be able to punish him just then behold
5370,3436-172171-0008.flac,and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses when he came again to his mother the countess had recovered from her swoon my son said she desirest thou to ride forth
5371,3436-172171-0057.flac,and perceval was resting on the shaft of his spear pondering the same thought
5372,3436-172171-0026.flac,i will do so tall man said perceval so he turned his horse's head toward the meadow and when he came there the knight was riding up and down proud of his strength and valor and noble mien tell me said the knight
5373,3436-172171-0002.flac,not only the animals of the chase for the table but even birds on the wing at length however perceval was roused to a desire of military renown by seeing in the forest five knights who were in complete armor
5374,3436-172171-0038.flac,and he came to a lake on the side of which was a fair castle and on the border of the lake he saw a hoary headed man sitting upon a velvet cushion and his attendants were fishing in the lake
5375,3436-172171-0020.flac,then all the household began to jeer and laugh at him but there was a certain damsel who had been a whole year at arthur's court
5376,3436-172171-0040.flac,and the hoary headed man received perceval courteously and asked him to sit by him on the cushion when it was time the tables were set and they went to meat and when they had finished their meat the hoary headed man asked perceval
5377,3436-172171-0045.flac,and when all the company saw this they began to weep and lament but for all that the man did not break off his discourse with perceval and as he did not tell him the meaning of what he saw he forbore to ask him concerning it
5378,3436-172171-0011.flac,for thus shalt thou acquire fame yet freely give it to another for thus thou shalt obtain praise if thou see a fair woman pay court to her for thus thou wilt obtain love
5379,3436-172171-0015.flac,for when her page was serving the queen with a golden goblet this knight struck the arm of the page and dashed the wine in the queen's face and over her stomacher then he said
5380,3436-172171-0046.flac,now the cup that perceval saw was the san greal and the spear the sacred spear and afterwards king pettyer removed with those sacred relics into a far country one evening
5381,3436-172171-0029.flac,and unless he do so quickly i will not wait for him by my faith said perceval choose thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly for i will have the horse and the arms and the goblet
5382,3436-172171-0044.flac,while perceval and his uncle discoursed together perceval beheld two youths entered the hall bearing a golden cup and a spear of mighty size with blood dripping from its point to the ground
5383,3436-172171-0001.flac,which was the only thing of all her lord's fair gear that his mother carried to the wood with her in the use of this he became so skilful that he could kill with it
5384,3436-172171-0059.flac,and two men have been before on this errand that is true said perceval and uncourteously they came they attacked me and i was annoyed thereat then he told him the thought that occupied his mind
5385,3436-172171-0022.flac,and carried a bell or babble in his hand though called a fool his words were often weighed and remembered as if there were a sort of oracular meaning in them
5386,3436-172171-0010.flac,and ask of him to bestow knighthood on thee and whenever thou seest a church repeat there thy paternoster
5387,3436-172171-0030.flac,upon this the knight ran at him furiously and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear
5388,3436-172171-0005.flac,such an one as i am said the knight if thou wilt tell me what i ask thee i will tell thee what thou askest me gladly will i do so said sir owain for that was the knight's name
5389,3436-172171-0036.flac,to revenge the injury he did to the maiden but take thou the goblet to queen guenover and tell king arthur that wherever i am i will be his vassal and will do him what profit and service i can and sir owain
5390,3436-172171-0009.flac,yes with thy leave said he go forward then she said to the court of arthur where there are the best and the noblest and the most bountiful of men and tell him thou art perceval the son of pallenor
5391,3436-172171-0007.flac,and perceval went to the place where they kept the horses that carried firewood and provisions for the castle and he took a bony piebald horse which seemed to him the strongest of them and he pressed a pack into the form of a saddle
5392,3436-172171-0021.flac,and the king's fool footnote a fool was a common appendage of the courts of those days when this romance was written a fool was the ornament held in next estimation to a dwarf he wore a white dress with a yellow bonnet
5393,3436-172171-0063.flac,i am right glad to meet thee said perceval for i have everywhere heard of thy prowess and uprightness and i solicit thy fellowship thou shalt have it by my faith and grant me thine said he
5394,3436-172171-0039.flac,when the hoary headed man beheld perceval approaching he arose and went into the castle perceval rode to the castle and the door was open and he entered the hall
5395,3436-172171-0058.flac,if i thought it would be as agreeable to thee as it would be to me i would converse with thee i have also a message from arthur unto thee to pray thee to come and visit him
5396,3436-172171-0051.flac,i will go and learn who he is
5397,3436-172171-0016.flac,let him follow me to the meadow so the knight took his horse and rode to the meadow carrying away the golden goblet and all the household hung down their heads and no one offered to follow the knight to take vengeance upon him
5398,3436-172171-0062.flac,who art thou and he replied
5399,3436-172171-0053.flac,and when the youth returned to the king and told how rudely he had been treated sir kay said i will go myself and when he greeted perceval and got no answer he spoke to him rudely and angrily
5400,3436-172171-0055.flac,surnamed the golden tongued because he was the most courteous knight in arthur's court it is not fitting that any should disturb an honorable knight from his thought unadvisedly for either he is pondering some damage that he has sustained
5401,3436-172171-0056.flac,or he is thinking of the lady whom best he loves if it seem well to thee lord i will go and see if this knight has changed from his thought and if he has i will ask him courteously to come and visit thee
5402,3436-172171-0019.flac,what wouldst thou with arthur asked kay my mother told me to go to arthur and receive knighthood from him by my faith said he thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and with arms
5403,3436-172171-0041.flac,if he knew how to fight with the sword i know not said perceval but were i to be taught doubtless i should and the hoary headed man said to him i am thy uncle thy mother's brother i am called king petheur
5404,3436-172171-0060.flac,and gawain said this was not an ungentle thought and i should marvel if it were pleasant for thee to be drawn from it then said perceval tell me is sir kay in arthur's court
5405,3436-172171-0035.flac,and urged on his horse with a stick then owain would have had him return to the court to receive the praise that was his due but perceval said i will not come to the court till i have encountered the tall man that is there
5406,8088-284756-0023.flac,you can judge for yourself whether the trip was worth while here she is with a gesture he flung open the door and i stared following his glance down at the great tiled swimming pool it is difficult for me to describe the scene
5407,8088-284756-0044.flac,she managed to claw me just once mercer resumed wrapping the robe about him again then i got out and called on carson for help i put him into a bathing suit and we both endeavored to corner her
5408,8088-284756-0020.flac,his eyes dark and large smiled easily and shone with interest but his almost beautiful mouth beneath the long slim moustache always closely cropped seldom smiled with his eyes but it was his present excited speech that amazed me most
5409,8088-284756-0075.flac,i had not forgotten the livid jagged furrows in mercer's side quickly as i shot to the ladder she was there before me a dim wavering white shape waiting i paused holding to a rung of ha ladder with one hand
5410,8088-284756-0060.flac,so that the elongated electrope pressed against the back of his neck extending a few inches down his spine the other three circular electrodes rested on his forehead and either side of his head
5411,8088-284756-0116.flac,but there is no retracing the way i nodded my head bowed on my streaming chest sorry mercer i muttered something got into me those big eyes of hers seemed to tug a threads of memory buried i can't describe it
5412,8088-284756-0029.flac,the great cloud of corn colored hair floated down about it falling below the knees slowly with a grace of movement comparable only with the slow soaring of a gull she came toward me walking on the bottom of the pool through the clear water as though she floated in air
5413,8088-284756-0002.flac,daring a thousand dangers for the sake of the straw packed bottles they carried sea bronzed men with hard flat muscles and fearless eyes ready guns slapping their thighs as they
5414,8088-284756-0012.flac,with the gravel rattling on my fenders i turned off the concrete and swept between the two massive stuccoed pillars that guarded the drive both of them bored corroded bronze plates the billows the name given the monstrosity by the original owner
5415,8088-284756-0028.flac,porcelain i asked hoarcely the thing had an indescribably eery effect he laughed wildly porcelain watch look my eyes followed his pointing finger
5416,8088-284756-0042.flac,i ran through the french windows out into the patio for a moment she ran after me rather awkwardly and heavily but swiftly nevertheless then she saw the pool apparently forgetting that i existed she leaped into the water
5417,8088-284756-0027.flac,even in the soft light i could see her perfectly through the clear water her pale body outlined sharply against the jade green tiles i tore myself away from the staring curious eyes of the figure in god's name mercer what is it
5418,8088-284756-0119.flac,we can try old timer i said a bit shakenly mercer hurried back to the other side of the pool and i adjusted my headsed again smiling down at the girl
5419,8088-284756-0109.flac,the girl was thinking of her suffering taken out of her native element
5420,8088-284756-0051.flac,i asked eagerly glancing down at the beautiful pale face that glimmered up at me through the clear water of the pool why try it on her exclaimed mercer with a mounting enthusiasm don't you see taylor
5421,8088-284756-0001.flac,there was a real romance and adventure rum runners seeking out their hidden port with their cargo of contraband from cuba heading fearlessly through the darkness fighting the high seas still running after the storm of a day or so before
5422,8088-284756-0063.flac,very nice old chap carson impressive even in his bathing suit mercer was mighty lucky to have a man like carson something seemed to tick suddenly somewhere deep en my consciousness yes that's very true
5423,8088-284756-0069.flac,she was such a slim graceful almost delicate little thing the thought that three strong men might not be able to control her seemed almost amusing you haven't seen her in action yet said mercer grimly
5424,8088-284756-0006.flac,i had never heard mercer speak in that high pitched excited voice before his usual speech was slow and thoughtful almost dedatic
5425,8088-284756-0068.flac,i'll lengthen these leads so that we can run them out into the pool and then we'll be ready somehow we must induce her to wear one of these things even if we have to use force i'm sure the three of us can handle her we should be able to i smiled
5426,8088-284756-0065.flac,i received your thoughts regarding carson and then turned the switch so that you received my thought and you did rather gingerly i removed the thing from my head and laid it on the table it's wizardly mercer if it will work as well on her it will i know it will
5427,8088-284756-0083.flac,i pointed upward for i was feeling the need for fresh air again and slowly mounted the ladder this time she did not grasp me but watched me intently as though understanding what i did and the reasons for it
5428,8088-284756-0112.flac,there was a strange fascination about this girl from the depths of the sea a subtle appeal that was answered from some deep subterranean cavern of my being i forgot for the moment who in what i was
5429,8088-284756-0077.flac,perhaps i thought quickly this was with her a sign of greeting i lifted my own arm and returned the salutation if salutation it were aware of a strange rising and falling sound as of a distant humming in my ears
5430,8088-284756-0053.flac,look and he held out a thin aristocratic brown hand before my eyes a hand that shook with nervous excitement i don't blame you i said quickly
5431,8088-284756-0058.flac,nothing assembled put the different entenna plug into these jacks like this he picked up a weird hastily built contrivance composed of two semicircular pieces of spring brass crossed at right angles
5432,8088-284756-0074.flac,i headed directly towards the heavy bronze ladder that led to the bottom of the pool i had two reasons in mind i would need something to keep me under water with my lungs full of air and i could get out quickly if it were necessary
5433,8088-284756-0038.flac,the shore was littered with all sorts of flotsam and jetsamd washed up by the big storm and i was just thinking that i would have to have a man with a truck come and clean up the shore in front of the place when in a little sandy pool i saw her
5434,8088-284756-0111.flac,adjusted to her own ideas of what a man should be i flung the instrument from my head and dropped to the bottom of the pool i gripped both her shoulders gently to express my thanks and friendship my heart was pounding
5435,8088-284756-0007.flac,if it weren't urgent i wouldn't be calling you you know will you come you bet i said quickly feeling rather a fool for ragging him when he was in such deadly earnest have the receiver snapped and crackled
5436,8088-284756-0092.flac,i saw him run up to the pool and lift the slim pale figure in his arms
5437,8088-284756-0057.flac,and in the center a switch with four contact points a heavy snaky cable led from this panel to the maze of apparatus further on this is the control panel explained mercer the whole affair you understand is in laboratory form
5438,8088-284756-0049.flac,i think i have what you call my thought telegraph perfected experimentally he explained rapidly i fell asleep working on it at three o'clock or thereabouts this morning and some tests with carson seemed to indicate that it is a success
5439,8088-284756-0082.flac,i smiled back at her and shook my head
5440,8088-284756-0033.flac,and her bosom rising and falling beneath the veil of pale gold hair she was breathing water mercer literally jerked me away from the edge of the pool
5441,8088-284756-0089.flac,i smiled and nodded and pressed her shoulder in a token of friendly greeting then gesturing toward my own head again and pointing upward i climbed the ladder all right mercer i shouted start at once before she grows restless
5442,8088-284756-0052.flac,if it will work on her and we can direct her thoughts we can find out her history the history of her people we'll add a page to scientific history a whole big chapter that will make us famous man this is so big it sweapt me off my feet
5443,8088-284756-0088.flac,no mean feet under water she hesitated a moment and then her eyes fixed on mine
5444,8088-284756-0059.flac,on all four ends were bright silvery electrodes three of them circular in shape one of them elongated and slightly curved with a quick nervous gesture mercer fitted the thing to his head
5445,8088-284756-0005.flac,get in your car and come down here as fast as possible come just as you are and what's the matter i managed to interrupt him burglars
5446,8088-284756-0022.flac,the other end of the room was nearly all glass and opened on to the patio and the swimming pool mercer paused a moment with his hand on the knob of the door a strange light in his dark eyes now you'll see why i called you here he said tensely
5447,8088-284756-0018.flac,mercer he laughed excitedly you'll see you'll see no i'm not in love and i want you to help and not admire there are only carson and myself here you know and the job's too big for the two of us
5448,8088-284756-0098.flac,the structures varied greatly in size and seemed to be arranged in some sort of regular order like houses along a narrow street
5449,8088-284756-0010.flac,mercer picked the place up for me at a song the monstrosity was some four miles further out from town and off the highway perhaps a half mile more
5450,8088-284756-0024.flac,the patio was not large but it was beautifully done flowers and shrubs even a few small palms grew in profusion in the enclosure while above throuh the movable glass roof made in sections to disappear in fine weather
5451,8088-284756-0105.flac,its naked ribs packed with drifted sand sauntering dreamily she moved away from the ancient derelect suddenly a dim shadow swept across the sand at her feet and she arrowed from the spot like a white slim meteor
5452,8088-284756-0031.flac,i tried to look away and found myself unable to move i felt mercer's tense sudden grip upon my arm but i did not could not look at him she she's smiling i heard him exclaim
5453,8088-284756-0062.flac,he adjusted a second contrivance upon my head smiling as i shrank from the contact of the cold metal on my skin and think he moved the switch from the position marked off to the second contact point watching me intently his dark eyes gleaming
5454,8088-284756-0030.flac,fascinated i watched her her eyes startlingly large and dark in the strangely white face were fixed on mine there was nothing sinister in the gaze yet i felt my body shaking as though in a grip of a terrible fear
5455,8088-284756-0061.flac,some ten feet in length ending in a simple switchboard plug which mercer fitted into the uppermost of the three jacks now he directed you put on this one
5456,8088-284756-0014.flac,apparently every bulb in the place was burning just a few yards beyond the surf boomed hollowly on the smooth shady shore littered now i knew by the pitiful spoils of the storm
5457,8088-284756-0107.flac,the white figure of the girl shot onward through the scarlet flood blinded she did not see that the jutting ribs of the ancient ship were in her path i seemed to see her crash head on into one of the massive timbers
5458,8088-284756-0076.flac,she came closer walking with the airy grace i had noted before and my heart pounded against my ribs as she raised one long slim arm towards me
5459,8088-284756-0013.flac,a newly rich munitions manufacturer the structure itself loomed up before me in a few seconds a rambling affair with square shouldered balconies and a great deal of wrought iron work after the most flamboyant spanish pattern it was ablaze with light
5460,8088-284756-0118.flac,i asked hesitantily i believe replied mercer that she can give us the history of her people if we can only make her understand what we wish god if we only could
5461,8088-284756-0039.flac,she was laying face down in the water motionless her head towards the sea one arm stretched out before her and her long hair wrapped around her like a half transparent cloak i ran up and lifted her from the water her body was cold and deathly white
5462,8088-284756-0114.flac,then strangling i tore myself from her embrace and shot to the surface coughing i cleared my lungs of the water i had inhaled i was weak and shaking when i finished but my head was clear the grip of the strange fantasy that had gripped me was shaken off
5463,8088-284756-0008.flac,usually the very soul of courtesy and consideration
5464,8088-284756-0046.flac,we moved out of the room nothing human can live under water and breathe water as she does mercer paused a moment staring at me oddly the human race he said gravely came up out of sea the human race as we know it some may have gone back
5465,8088-284756-0102.flac,the clinging tresses were censured at the waist with a sort of cord of twisted orange colored material and some of the younger women wore bands of the same material around their brows nearest of all the figures was the girl who was visualizing all this for us
5466,8088-284756-0096.flac,and i sensed through the medium of the instrument i wore that she was thinking of me i saw my own features idealized glowing with a strange beauty that was certainly none of my own i realized that i saw myself in short as she saw me
5467,8088-284756-0073.flac,there was something devilishly fascinating about the girl's great dark searching eyes i'm going in i said hoarsely
5468,8088-284756-0093.flac,i visualized them just as i could close my eyes and visualize for example the fireplace in the living room of my own home i looked down at the girl she was frowning and her eyes were very wide
5469,8088-284756-0050.flac,i should have called you to morrow for further test nearly five years of damn hard work to a successful conclusion taylor
5470,8088-284756-0037.flac,i walked along briskly for perhaps five minutes
5471,8088-284756-0091.flac,so that my head remained out of water and smiled down at the girl touching the instrument on my head and then pointing to hers i could sense mercer's thoughts now he was picturing himself walking long the shore with the stormy ocean in the background
5472,8088-284756-0016.flac,he was wearing a bathrobe hastily flung on over a damp bathing suit his bare legs terminating in a pair of disreputable slippers fine taylor he greeted me i suppose you're wondering what it's all about i don't blame you but come in come in
5473,8088-284756-0103.flac,she was walking slowly away from the cluster of coral structures once or twice she paused and seemed to hold conversation with others of the strange people but each time she moved on the coral structures grew smaller and poorer
5474,8088-284756-0086.flac,i'll try to impress that on her understand i nodded and picked up one of the instruments fire wen ready gridley i commented and sank again to the bottom of the pool i touched the girl's head with one finger and then pointed to my own head
5475,8088-284756-0054.flac,let's get busy what can i do mercer reached around the door into the laboratory and pressed a button for carson he explained we'll need hus help in the meantime we'll look over the set up the apparatus is strewn all over the place
5476,8088-284756-0100.flac,or at time shot overhead like veritable torpedoes there were both men and women moving there the men were broader of shoulder and their hair which they wore to their knees was somewhat darker in color than that of the women both sexes were slim
5477,8088-284756-0064.flac,the words were not spoken i did not hear them i knew them what i glanced at mercer and he laughed aloud with pleasure and excitement it worked he cried
5478,8088-284756-0045.flac,carson got two bad scratches and one rather serious bite that i have bandaged i have a number of lacerations but i didn't fare so badly as carson because i am faster in the water than he is the harder we tried the more determined i became
5479,8088-284756-0113.flac,her great weirdly blue eyes seemed to bore into my brain i could feel them throbbing there i forgot time and space i saw only that pale smiling face in those great dark eyes
5480,8088-284756-0094.flac,her head was a little on one side in the attitude of one who listens intently slowly and carefully mercer thought out the whole story of his experiences with the girl until she had plunged into the pool then i saw again the beach
5481,8088-284756-0040.flac,and took the liquor in a single draught she did not seem to drink it but sucked it out of the glass in a single amazing gulp that's the only word for it
5482,8088-284756-0011.flac,i made the four miles in just a shade over that many minutes and clamped on the brakes as i saw the entrance to the little drive that led towards the sea and mercer's estate
5483,8088-284756-0071.flac,it was the first time i had seen her move in this fashion she seemed to propel herself with a sudden mighty thrust of her feet against the bottom she darted through the water with the speed of an arrow yet stopped as gently as though she had merely floated there
5484,8088-284756-0055.flac,he had not exaggerated the set up consisted of a whole bank of tubes each one in its own shielding copper box on a much drilled horizontal panel propped up on insulators were half a score of delicate meters of one kind and another
5485,8088-284756-0036.flac,late this afternoon i decided to go for a little walk along the beach mercer began i had been working like the devil since early in the morning running some tests on what you call my thought telegraph i felt the need of some fresh sea air
5486,8088-284756-0078.flac,the sound ceased suddenly on a rising note as though of inquiry and it dawned on me that i had heard the speech of this strange creature before i could think of a course of action my aching lungs reminded me of the need of air
5487,8088-284756-0095.flac,i was aware of the soft little tick in the center of my brain that announced that the switch had been moved to another contact point i glanced down at her she was staring up at me with her great curious eyes
5488,8088-284756-0067.flac,the other two receive when the switch is on the first contact number one sends and number two and three receive when the switch is on number two then he sends thoughts and number one and three receive them and so on
5489,8088-284756-0003.flac,absorbed in my mental picture of these modern freebooters the sudden alarm of the telephone startled me like an unexpected shot fire beside my ear brushing the cigarette ashes from my smoking jacket i crossed the room and snatched up the receiver
5490,8088-284756-0021.flac,mercer during all the years i had known him had never been moved before to such tempestuous outburst of enthusiasm it was his habit to speak slowly and thoughtfully in his low musical voice even in the midst of our hottest arguments and we had had many of them
5491,8088-284756-0032.flac,he laughed an excited high pitched laugh that irritated me in some subtle way she was smiling and looking up into my eyes she was very close now within a few feet of us
5492,8088-284756-0017.flac,just wait till you see her her i asked startled
5493,8088-284756-0104.flac,finally the girl trod alone on the floor of the ocean between great growths of kelp and seaweeds with dim looming masses of faintly tinted coral everywhere once she passed close to a tilted ragged hulk of some ancient vessel
5494,8088-284756-0043.flac,i reminded him as he paused apparently lost in thought i tried to find out more about her i put on my bathing suit and dived into the pool well she came at me like a shark quick as a flash her teeth showing her hands tearing like claws through the water
5495,8088-284756-0019.flac,he hurried me across the broad concrete porch and into the house throw the cap anywhere and come on too much amazed to comment further i followed my friend this was a warrn mercer i did not know
5496,8088-284756-0106.flac,but behind her darted a black and swifter shadow a shark like a flash she turned and faced the monster something she had drawn from her girdle shone palely in her hand it was a knife of wetted stone or bone
5497,8088-284756-0080.flac,i looked down the girl was watching me and there was no smile on her face now
5498,8088-284756-0025.flac,was the empty blackness of the sky none of the lights provided for the illumination of the covered patio was turned on but all the windows surrounding the patio were aglow and i could see the pool quite clearly the pool and its occupant
5499,8088-284756-0097.flac,a dim bluish light filtered down on the scene such as mortal eyes had never seen all around were strange structures of jagged coral roughly circular as to base and roundet on top resembling very much the eglus of the esqimos
5500,8088-284756-0081.flac,as her face came close to my own i became aware of the humming crooning sound i had heard before louder this time
5501,8088-284756-0090.flac,i've already started he called back and i hurriedly donned my own instrument
5502,8088-284756-0115.flac,mercer was bending over me speaking softly i was watching old man he said gently i can imagine what happened a momentary psychic fusing of an ancient long since broken link you together with all mankind came up out of the sea
5503,8088-284756-0099.flac,around many of them grew clusters of strange and colorful seaweeds that waved their banners gently as though some imperceptible current dallied with them in passing here and there figures moved slim white figures that strolled along the narrow street
5504,8088-284756-0047.flac,mercer some may have gone back i don't get it mercer shook his head but made no other reply until we stood again on the edge of the pool the girl was standing where we had left her and as she looked up into my face she smiled again
5505,8051-295385-0023.flac,i forbear to dilate upon the war of words which was kept up for some time by these windy commanders van puffenburgh however had served under william the testy and was a veteran in this kind of warfare
5506,8051-295385-0034.flac,for it came to pass that a great cloud of mosquitoes arose out of the marshy borders of the river and settled upon the fortress of helsenburg being doubtless attracted by the scent of the fresh blood of the swedish gormandizers
5507,8051-295385-0010.flac,reaching from his waistband to his chin the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners and separating gallantly behind so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone colored trunk breeches
5508,8051-295385-0027.flac,and whichever had the wind in its favor would keep up a continual firing of cannon to taunt its antagonist with the smell of gunpowder on all these points of windy warfare the antagonists were well matched
5509,8051-295385-0003.flac,nor through the livelong lazy summer's day chants forth his love sick soul in madrigel's to manhood roused he spurns the amorous flute doffs from his brawny back the robe of peace
5510,8051-295385-0032.flac,and diverted into the larders of the hostile camps for some time this war of the cupboard was carried on to the great festivity and jollification of the swedes while the warriors of fort casimir found their hearts or rather their stomachs
5511,8051-295385-0013.flac,with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in advance in order to strengthen his position his right hand grasping a gold headed cane his left resting upon the pummel of his sword his head dressing spiritedly to the right
5512,8051-295385-0000.flac,and his gallant achievements on the delaware chapter one hitherto most venerable and courteous reader have i shown thee the administration of the valorous stuvesant under the mild moonshine of peace
5513,8051-295385-0035.flac,nay it is said that the body of yan printz alone
5514,8051-295385-0012.flac,stuck with a gallant and fiery air over his left eye such was the chivalric port of peter the headstrong and when he made a sudden halt planted himself firmly on his solid supporter
5515,8051-295385-0037.flac,such was the famous mosquito war on the delaware of which general van poffenburgh would fain have been the hero but the devout people of the new nederlands always ascribed the discomfiture of the swedes
5516,8051-295385-0016.flac,upon cabbages sunflowers and pumpkins for want of better occasion to flesh his sword now it came to pass that higher up the delaware at his stronghold of tinnekonk
5517,8051-295385-0009.flac,which still hangs in the family mansion of the stuyvesants arrayed in all the terrors of a true dutch general his regimental coat of german blue gorgeously decorated with a goodly show of large brass buttons
5518,8051-295385-0014.flac,with a most appalling and hard favored frown upon his brow he presented altogether one of the most commanding bitter looking and soldier like figures that ever strutted upon canvas
5519,8051-295385-0006.flac,equipping our warriors with bucklers helms and lances and such like outlandish and obsolete weapons the like of which perchance they had never seen or heard of in the same manner that a cunning statuary arrays a modern general or an admiral
5520,8051-295385-0015.flac,proceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation in the preceding chapter we have spoken of the founding of fort casimir and of the merciless warfare waged by its commander
5521,8051-295385-0029.flac,governor printz at once took advantage of this circumstance and compelled them to lower their flags as they passed under the guns of his battery this was a deadly wound to the dutch pride of general van poffenburg
5522,8051-295385-0036.flac,was sufficient to attract the mosquito from every part of the country for some time the garrison endeavored to hold out but it was all in vain the mosquitos penetrated into every chink and crevice and gave them no rest day nor night
5523,8051-295385-0005.flac,existed in the city of new amsterdam this is but a lofty and gigantic mode in which we heroic writers always talk of war thereby to give it a noble and imposing aspect
5524,8051-295385-0004.flac,and clothes his pampered limbs in panoply of steel o'er his dark brow where late the myrtle waved where wanton roses breathed enervate love he rears the beaming caske and nodding plume grasps the bright shield
5525,8051-295385-0008.flac,and prepare himself to undergo those hardy toils of war in which his mighty soul so much delighted methinks i at this moment behold him in my imagination or rather i behold his goodly portrait
5526,8051-295385-0017.flac,who styled himself governor of new sweden if history belie not this redoubtable swede he was a rival worthy of the windy and inflated commander of fort casimir for master david petersen de vris in his excellent book of voyages
5527,8051-295385-0002.flac,and the rude clash of hostile arms speaks fearful prophecies of coming troubles the gallant warrior starts from soft repose from golden visions and voluptuous ease wherein the dulcet piping time of peace
5528,8051-295385-0007.flac,in the accoutrements of a caesar or an alexander the simple truth then of all this oratorical flourish is this that the valiant peter stuyvesant all of a sudden found it necessary
5529,8051-295385-0033.flac,daily failing them at length the summer heats and summer showers set in and now low and behold a great miracle was wrought for the relief of the nederlands
5530,8051-295385-0019.flac,guzzling deep drinking swash bucklers who made the wild woods ring with their carousals no sooner did this robustious commander hear of the erection of fort casimir than he sent a message to van poffenburg
5531,8051-295385-0031.flac,it is possible he may have paid to the dutch skippers the full value of their commodities but what consolation was this to jacobus van poffenburgh and his garrison who thus found their favorite supplies cut off
5532,8051-295385-0024.flac,governor printz finding he was not to be dislodged by these long shots now determined upon coming to closer quarters accordingly he descended the river in great force and fume and erected a rival fortress
5533,8051-295385-0026.flac,like a couple of belligerent turkey cocks there was a contest who should run up the tallest flag staff and display the broadest flag all day long there was a furious rolling of drums and twanging of trumpets in either fortress
5534,8051-295385-0038.flac,to the miraculous intervention of saint nicholas as to the fortress of helsenburg it fell to ruin
5535,8051-295385-0028.flac,but so it happened that the swedish fortress being lower down the river all the dutch vessels bound to fort casimir with supplies had to pass it
5536,8051-295385-0022.flac,of her swedish majesty christina and woe be to any mortal that wore a breeches who should dare to meddle even with the hem of her sacred garment
5537,8051-295385-0021.flac,from the manhattos as witness the breeches of their land measurer tenbrok to this the governor rejoined that the land had previously been sold by the indians to the swedes and consequently was under the petticoat government
5538,8051-295385-0025.flac,just one swedish mile below fort casimir to which he gave the name of helsenburg and now commenced a tremendous rivalry between these two doughty commanders striving to outstrut and outswell each other
5539,8051-295385-0001.flac,or rather the grim tranquillity of awful expectation but now the war drum rumbles from afar the brazen trumpet brays its thrilling note
5540,8051-295385-0020.flac,warning him off the land as being within the bounds of his jurisdiction to this general van poffenburgh replied that the land belonged to their high mightinesses having been regularly purchased of the natives as discoverers
5541,8051-295385-0018.flac,describes him as weighing upwards of four hundred pounds a huge feeder and bouser in proportion taking three potations pottle deep at every meal he had a garrison after his own heart at tinnekonk
5542,8051-295385-0011.flac,a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our day and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes who scorned to defend themselves in rear
5543,8051-295385-0030.flac,and sorely would he swell when from the ramparts of fort casimir he beheld the flag of their high mightinesses struck to the rival fortress to heighten his vexation governor printz who as has been shown was a huge trencherman
5544,8051-118101-0027.flac,left simply because he never got anything for his labor
5545,8051-118101-0028.flac,his master he describes thus his face was long cheek bones high middling tall and about twenty six years of age with this specimen of humanity charles was very much dissatisfied
5546,8051-118101-0034.flac,charles was sorry for the fate of his sisters but he could not help them if he remained staying to wear the yoke he felt would rather make it worse instead of better for all concerned

5548,8051-118101-0021.flac,and made up his mind to leave the first opportunity before this watchful and resolute purpose the way opened and he soon found it comparatively easy to find his way from maryland to pennsylvania and likewise into the hands of the vigilance committee
5549,8051-118101-0029.flac,and in making an effort to reach canada he was quite willing to suffer many things so the first chance charles got he started and providence smiled upon his resolution
5550,8051-118101-0036.flac,this schriner was described as a low chunky man with grum look big mouth et cetera and was a member of the german reformed church don't swear though might as well he was so bad other ways
5551,8051-118101-0032.flac,and this was what made charles unhappy uneducated as he was he was too sensible to believe that webster had any god given right to his manhood consequently he left because his master did not treat him right
5552,8051-118101-0026.flac,though his stout and hearty appearance would have rendered him very desirable to a trader he fled from william wheeling of sandy hook maryland he spoke of his master as a pretty bad man who was always quarreling and would drink swear and lie
5553,8051-118101-0025.flac,stephen's parents were dead one brother was the only near relative he left in chains charles brown was about twenty five years of age quite black and bore the marks of having been used hard

5558,8051-118101-0022.flac,to whom he made known fully the character of the place and people whence he had fled the dangers he was exposed to from slave hunters and the strong hope he cherished of reaching free land soon
5559,8051-118101-0030.flac,true the thought of his mother and brothers left in the prison house largely marred his joy as it did also the committees still the committee felt that charles had gained his freedom honorably

5562,8051-118101-0012.flac,and charles henry salter chaskey is about twenty four years of age quite black medium size sound body and intelligent appearance nevertheless he resembled a farm hand in every particular

5652,6880-216547-0074.flac,this proposition now coming into notice property is robbery was of a nature to repel from your book even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances had you persisted in maintaining it

5661,6880-216547-0055.flac,inconsiderately accepting gathering together and accumulating everything that is new regarding all reports as true
5662,6880-216547-0092.flac,but the majestic and imposing order of human societies that i sometimes find myself embarrassed in attacking certain abuses i like to rebuild with one hand when i am compelled to destroy with the other
5663,6880-216547-0096.flac,and we build henceforth upon the sand instead of on a rock that i cannot agree to and for that reason i have criticised your book so full of beautiful pages
5664,6880-216547-0053.flac,and what they ought to fear the people incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas provided that in them they get a taste of flattery

5670,6880-216547-0110.flac,will satisfy all the moral and political needs which induce the establishment of the first on the following conditions then of subsequent evidence depends the correctness of my preceding arguments
5671,6880-216547-0087.flac,what chagrin i should always have felt if the king's counsel that is to say the intellectual executioner had followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person
5672,6880-216547-0061.flac,to example and to its own dignity to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti social doctrines contained in this publication in consequence he demands
5673,6880-216547-0090.flac,but see to it sir that ere long they do not come in spite of you to seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal and that your vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophists of the market place

5678,6880-216547-0097.flac,so brilliant with knowledge and fervor i wish sir that my impaired health would permit me to examine with you page by page the memoir which you have done me the honor to addresse to me publicly and personally
5679,6880-216547-0078.flac,which cures all evils i will go farther i will confess that of all abuses the most hateful to me are those of property but once more

5682,6880-216547-0062.flac,in the most formal manner the work of the suar pensioner as having been published without its assent and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members
5683,6880-216547-0106.flac,an hypothesis admitted in mathematics although not proven while i consider that this figure will be a circle honest people can at least understand one another
5684,6880-216547-0083.flac,if i may so speak in your metaphysical mill one who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur in these too beautiful and paradoxical improvisation of yours cannot be a pure and unwavering utipist

5688,6880-216547-0041.flac,it was my duty this blame results from the facts which i call attention to why has the church decreed concerning things which it does not understand
5689,6880-216547-0026.flac,that the principle of equality of conditions not being demonstrated the ideas of the author were nothing more than hypotheses finally gentlemen

5698,6880-216547-0007.flac,my enthusiasm for its glory were unbounded convinced at once that in order to break loose from the beaten paths of opinions and systems it was necessary to proceed in my study of man and society

5701,6880-216547-0029.flac,instead of confining one to commonplaces without breadth or significance it seems to me that your question should be developed as follows
5702,6880-216547-0038.flac,but i should be unjust did i not distinguish between this pretended science and the men who practise it devoted to studies both laborious and severe
5703,6880-216547-0035.flac,has always been misunderstood if by an infallible method of investigation i establish the dogma of equality of conditions if i determine the principle of civil law the essence of justice and the form of society
5704,6880-216547-0012.flac,has already rewarded my efforts but gentlemen of all the masters whom i have followed to none do i owe so much as to you
5705,6880-216547-0011.flac,my perception of the fact that these sciences though badly defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere are like the natural sciences susceptible of demonstration and certainty
5706,6880-216547-0013.flac,your co operation your programms your instructions in agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished hopes have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road this memoir on property
5707,6880-216547-0039.flac,entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow citizens by their knowledge and eloquence our legists deserve but one reproach that of an excessive deference to arbitrary laws
5708,6880-216547-0017.flac,when your committee reported that the competitors had enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of suicide as well as the means of preventing each of them but that from this enumeration
5709,6880-216547-0019.flac,your programme always original and varied in its academical expression became more exact the investigations of eighteen thirty eight had pointed out as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social malady

5712,6880-216547-0037.flac,to the problems of philosophy every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it i have spoken lightly of jurisprudence i had the right
5713,6880-216547-0046.flac,in a society like ours to seek for literary glory seems to me in anacronism of what use is it to invoke an ancient sybyl when a muse is on the eve of birth
5714,6880-216547-0030.flac,can it not render it equal for all his grandchildren and great grandchildren if the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family can it not by the right of heredity
5715,6880-216547-0040.flac,and their unwarranted blunders have disgusted me whoever knowing them pardons them may read them i have severely blamed the learned christian church
5716,6880-216547-0044.flac,i have too much neglected form and style in vain should i have tried to do better literary hope and faith i have none
5717,6880-216547-0021.flac,the utility of the celebration of sunday as regards hygene morality and social and political relation in a christian tongue you asked gentlemen
5718,6880-216547-0042.flac,the church has urred in dogma and in morals physics and mathematics testify against her it may be wrong for me to say it but suly it is unfortunate for christianity that it is true
5719,6880-216547-0020.flac,the neglect of the principles of religion and morality the desire for wealth the passion for enjoyment and political disturbances all these data were embodied by you in a single proposition
5720,911-130578-0020.flac,i must have been asleep a very long time then his son explained to him all that had happened and gave him some food
5721,911-130578-0000.flac,and for this the village boys with whom he played used to quarrel with him saying fatherless orphan why do you cheat so one day he asked his mother why they called him that name and whether his father was really dead
5722,911-130578-0013.flac,the sight of them frightened him and he sang drink your fill tiger i shall not shoot you
5723,911-130578-0012.flac,and climbed up a tall sal tree from the tree he watched the bison go down to the water to drink and then go back into the jungle and after them tigers and bears came down to the water
5724,911-130578-0016.flac,he put an arrow through it and it turned a somersault and fell over dead
5725,911-130578-0003.flac,grannie grannie open the door i have no son and no grandchildren to call me grannie grumbled the old woman and went to open the door to see who was there and when she opened the door and saw him she said ho
5726,911-130578-0001.flac,he is alive said she but a long time ago a rhinocerous carried him off on its horn then the boy vowed that he would go in search of his father and made his mother put him up provisions for the journey
5727,911-130578-0009.flac,but this only broke her teeth and made her mouth bleed so that the pain was worse than before then the boy jeered at her and said did you think grannie that you could bite my iron bow and arrows so saying he left her
5728,911-130578-0005.flac,and she and the boy sat up late talking together and then they lay down to sleep but in the middle of the night he heard the old woman crunching away trying to bite his bow to pieces
5729,911-130578-0008.flac,and in truth her cheeks were badly swollen then he told her that a good cure for toothache was to bite on a white stone and she believed him and the next morning got a piece of white quartz and began to bite on it
5730,911-130578-0010.flac,and continued the search for his father
5731,911-130578-0007.flac,but really she had none to give however she only hurt her jaws biting so that she began to groan with pain what are you groaning for grannie said the boy
5732,911-130578-0002.flac,and he started off taking with him an iron bow and a big bundle of arrows he journeyed on all day and at nightfall he came to a village there he went up to the house of an old woman to ask for a bed
5733,911-130578-0019.flac,and then whip the body with a miral twig and he will come to life so saying the stranger suddenly disappeared and the boy obeyed his instructions and behold his father sat up alive and rubbing his eyes said
5734,911-130578-0004.flac,you are my grandson yes answered he i am your grandchild so she called him inside and gave him a bed to sleep on the old woman was called hutibudi
5735,911-130578-0017.flac,and ran away then the boy climbed down from the tree and pulled the dead body of his father off the horn of the dead animal and laid it down at the foot of a tree and began to weep over it as he wept
5736,911-130578-0018.flac,a man suddenly stood before him and asked what was the matter and when he heard said cry no more take a cloth and wet it in the lake and cover your father's body with it
5737,911-130578-0011.flac,he came to a lake and he sat down by it to eat what was left of the provisions he had brought as he sat he suddenly saw some cowbison coming down to the lake at this he caught up his bow and arrows in a hurry
5738,911-130578-0015.flac,and among them was one which had the dried up body of the boy's father stuck on its horn the boy was rather frightened and sang
5739,911-130578-0014.flac,and they drank and went away then various kinds of birds came
5740,911-130578-0006.flac,he asked her what she was eating some pulse i got from the village headman give me a little to try he begged i am sorry my child i have finished it all
5741,911-128684-0081.flac,but if on the contrary these words are words of sorting ambiguity is natural for then as soon as the relations of a thing are sufficiently various it can be sorted variously
5742,911-128684-0050.flac,are not coefficients with which experiences come to us aboriginally stamped but are rather results of a later classification performed by us for particular needs
5743,911-128684-0087.flac,its censorial adjustments are my attention
5744,911-128684-0041.flac,when clouds float by the moon it is as if both clouds and moon and we ourselves shared in the motion in the extraordinary case of amnesia
5745,911-128684-0002.flac,in opposition to this dualistic philosophy i tried in the first essay to show that thoughts and things are absolutely homogeneous as to their material and that their opposition is only one of relation and of function
5746,911-128684-0057.flac,are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena of our own consciousness there are no activities or effects in nature for the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation
5747,911-128684-0077.flac,and the purposes they subserve by their affective values in short that their consecution in our several conscious streams as thoughts of ours is mainly ruled desire introduces them interest holds them
5748,911-128684-0083.flac,the sun caresses it and the zephyr woos it as if it were a bed of roses so the disgustingness fails to operate within the realm of suns and breezes
5749,911-128684-0049.flac,or as rigorously physical facts so they remain equivocal and as the world goes their equivocality is one of their great conveniences
5750,911-128684-0056.flac,hardness and softness are effects on us of atomic interactions and the atoms themselves are neither hard nor soft nor solid nor liquid size and shape are deemed subjective by cantians
5751,911-128684-0040.flac,but not ascribed correctly to the body that really moves thus in optical vertigo caused by unconscious movements of our eyes both we and the external universe appear to be in a whirl
5752,911-128684-0039.flac,and doubtless passes with most readers for all right psychologists studying our perceptions of movement have unearthed experiences in which movement is felt in general
5753,911-128684-0055.flac,no one ever thought of calling these qualities subjective when however galileo decart and others found it best for philosophic purposes to class sound heat and light along with pain and pleasure as purely mental phenomena
5754,911-128684-0080.flac,immediately intuitively and infallibly discernible and each fixed forever in whatever bit of experience it qualified one does not see how there could ever have arisen any room for doubt or ambiguity
5755,911-128684-0012.flac,taken in this group we call both it and them ideas or sensations and the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of interrelation
5756,911-128684-0058.flac,nature exhibits only changes which habitually coincide with one another
5757,911-128684-0079.flac,is the most natural thing in the world it would however be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which i cited at the outset were correct if physical and mental meant two different kinds of intrinsic nature
5758,911-128684-0024.flac,in the two cases their contexts are apt to be different in the case of our affectional experiences we have no permanent and steadfast purpose that obliges us to be consistent
5759,911-128684-0004.flac,can stand alternately for a fact of consciousness or for a physical reality according as it is taken in one context or in another for the right understanding of what follows
5760,911-128684-0009.flac,any one content such as hard let us say can be assigned to either group in the outer group it is strong it acts energetically and aggressively
5761,911-128684-0033.flac,may count as feelings when we take them singly but when they combine in a total richness we call the result the beauty of the object and treat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives
5762,911-128684-0036.flac,were we forbidden to project words primarily connoting our affections upon the objects by which the affections are aroused the man is really hateful the action really mean the situation really tragic
5763,911-128684-0019.flac,in such a world the mental or the physical status of any piece of experience would be unequivocal whenactive it would figure in the physical and when inactive in the mental group
5764,911-128684-0007.flac,because i had to be so brief i now returned to the subject because i believe that so far from invalidating my general thesis these phenomena when properly analyzed afford it powerful support
5765,911-128684-0032.flac,and in sections ten and eleven of his work the sense of beauty he treats in a masterly way of this equivocal realm the various pleasures we receive from an object
5766,911-128684-0013.flac,the mutual impenetrability on the one hand and the lack of physical interference and interaction on the other that what in itself is one and the same entity should be able to function thus differently in different contexts
5767,911-128684-0064.flac,nor does its use or significance
5768,911-128684-0069.flac,they are not inert as regards that part of physical nature which our own skin covers it is those very appreciative attributes of things their dangerousness beauty rarity utility et cetera
5769,911-128684-0005.flac,in our pleasures and pains our loves and fears and angers in the beauty commicality importance or preciousness of certain objects and situations we have i am told by many critics
5770,911-128684-0048.flac,we shall probably judge it to have been there for both with the affectional experiences which we are considering the relatively pure condition lasts in practical life no urgent need has yet arisen for deciding whether to treat them as rigorously mental
5771,911-128684-0035.flac,an agreeable degree of heat or an agreeable feeling occasioned by the degree of heat either will do and language would lose most of its esthetic and rhetorical value
5772,911-128684-0070.flac,that primarily appeal to our attention in our commerce with nature these attributes are what give emphasis to objects and for an object to be emphatic whatever spiritual fact it may mean
5773,911-128684-0075.flac,for though in that group it be true that things do not act on one another by their physical properties do not dent each other or set fire to each other
5774,911-128684-0018.flac,it is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only alternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or complete inertness
5775,911-128684-0063.flac,it does not work to assume that physical objects are going to act outwardly by their sympathetic or antipathetic qualities the beauty of a thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon of compositions
5776,911-128684-0043.flac,noticed an attendant walk across the room he identified the movement with that of his own he did not yet discriminate between his own movements and those outside himself
5777,911-128684-0037.flac,all in themselves and quite apart from our opinion we even go so far as to talk of a weary road a giddy height a jocund morning or a sullen sky
5778,911-128684-0090.flac,it is their way of behaving towards each other their system of relations their function and all these things vary with the context in which we find it opportune to consider them i think i may conclude then
5779,911-128684-0000.flac,are as dualistic as it is possible to be thoughts we all naturally think are made of one kind of substance and things of another consciousness flowing inside of us in the forms of conception or judgment
5780,911-128684-0045.flac,motion originally simply is only later is it confined to this thing or to that something like this is true of every experience however complex
5781,911-128684-0073.flac,that however is enough to save them from being classed as absolutely non objective the attempt if any one should make it to sort experiences into two absolutely discreet groups
5782,911-128684-0021.flac,in the paragraphs that follow i shall try to show one that the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given as purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous and two
5783,911-128684-0029.flac,and we are always free to speak of them in objective as well as in subjective terms we can say that we are aware of a painful place filling a certain bigness in our organism
5784,911-128684-0042.flac,published by citus and good heart in their important work on multiple personality we read that when the patient first recovered consciousness and
5785,911-128684-0076.flac,they yet act on each other in the most energetic way by those very characters which are so inert extra corporally it is by the interest and importance that experiences have for us by the emotions they excite
5786,911-128684-0011.flac,in the mind on the contrary the hard thing is nowhere in particular it dents nothing it suffuses through its mental neighbors as it were and interpenetrates them
5787,911-128684-0091.flac,and i hope that my readers are now ready to conclude with me that the pretended spirituality of our emotions and of our attributes of value so far from proving an objection to the philosophy of pure experience does when rightly discussed and accounted for
5788,911-128684-0010.flac,here whatever is hard interferes with the space its neighbors occupy it dense them is impenetrable by them and we call the hardness then a physical hardness
5789,911-128684-0084.flac,it does not function as a physical quality but the carrion turns our stomach by what seems a direct operation it does function physically therefore in that limited part of physics
5790,911-128684-0023.flac,classifications depend on our temporary purposes for certain purposes it is convenient to take things in one set of relations
5791,911-128684-0001.flac,or concentrating itself in the shape of passion or emotion can be directly felt as the spiritual activity which it is and known in contrast with the space filling objective content which it envelops and accompanies
5792,911-128684-0068.flac,why then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do and not class them decisively as purely spiritual the reason would seem to be that although they are inert as regards the rest of physical nature
5793,911-128684-0062.flac,turn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us we soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our interests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another
5794,911-128684-0061.flac,both rationalism and the usual empiricism claim that they are exclusively the work of the mind the finite mind or the absolute mind as the case may be
5795,911-128684-0086.flac,sometimes again i think of it as mine i sort it with the me and then certain local changes and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings its breathing is my thinking
5796,911-128684-0014.flac,is a natural consequence of the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come to her offspring a tigress is tender but cruel to every other living thing
5797,911-128684-0074.flac,with nothing but inertness in one of them and nothing but activities in the other would thus receive one check it would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively mental group
5798,911-128684-0026.flac,thus would these experiences so far from being an obstacle to the pure experienced philosophy serve as an excellent corroboration of its truth first of all then it is a mistake to say
5799,911-128684-0053.flac,into the water which it sets a boiling it is the very light of the arc lamp which displaces the darkness of the midnight street et cetera by engendering and translocating just these qualities
5800,911-128684-0016.flac,it is absolutely inert it is thus both energetic and inert and the same is true if you vary the associates properly of every other piece of experience
5801,911-128684-0059.flac,but only a translocation of experiences from one world to another a grouping of them with one set or another of associates for definitely practical or intellectual ends
5802,911-128684-0066.flac,even such things as forces tensions and activities can at a pinch be regarded as anthropromorphic projections so far then as the physical world means the collection of contents that determine in each other certain regular changes
5803,911-128684-0006.flac,a great realm of experience intuitively recognized as spiritual made and felt to be made of consciousness exclusively and different in nature from the spacefilling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects
5804,911-128684-0071.flac,means also that it produces immediate bodily effects upon us alterations of tone and tension of heart beat and breathing of vascular and viceral action
5805,911-128684-0030.flac,or we can say that we are inwardly in a state of pain all our adjectives of worth are similarly ambiguous
5806,911-128684-0044.flac,in which discriminations afterwards needful have not yet been made a piece of experience of a determinate sort is there but there at first as a pure fact
5807,911-128684-0089.flac,prove how hard it is to decide by bare introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either spiritual or material it surely can be nothing intrinsic in the individual experience
5808,911-128684-0003.flac,there is no thought stuff different from thing stuff i said but the same identical piece of pure experience which was the name i gave to the materia prima of everything
5809,911-128684-0067.flac,the whole collection of our appreciative attributes has to be treated as falling outside of it if we mean by physical nature whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies
5810,911-128684-0052.flac,things act on each other as well as on us by means of their secondary qualities sound as such goes through the air and can be intercepted
5811,911-128684-0072.flac,the interesting aspects of things are thus not wholly inert physically though they be active only in these small corners of physical nature which our bodies occupy
5812,911-128684-0078.flac,fitness fixes their order and connection i need only refer for this aspect of our mental life
5813,911-128684-0054.flac,actively efficacious as they seem to be we ourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us and until more purely intellectual as distinguished from practical needs have arisen
5814,911-128684-0031.flac,or is it a feeling in our mind practically we treat it as both or as either according to the temporary direction of our thought beauty says professor santaana is pleasure objectified
5815,911-128684-0025.flac,so we find it easy to let them float ambiguously sometimes classing them with our feelings sometimes with more physical realities according to caprice or to the convenience of the moment
5816,911-128684-0085.flac,and conversely of course we must treat it as nonmental or as mental our body itself is the palmery instance of the ambiguous sometimes i treat my body purely as a part of outer nature
5817,911-128684-0020.flac,but the universe we live in is more chaotic than this and there is room in it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences of our emotions and appreciative perceptions
5818,911-128684-0060.flac,i will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of relations they are undeniable parts of pure experience yet while common sense and what i call radical empiricism stand for their being objective
5819,911-128684-0046.flac,at the moment of its actual presence let the reader arrest himself in the act of reading this article now
5820,911-128684-0028.flac,they are simultaneously affections of the body
5821,911-128684-0034.flac,we discover beauty just as we discover the physical properties of things training is needed to make us expert in either line single sensations also may be ambiguous shall we say
5822,911-128684-0008.flac,the centrial point of the pure experienced theory is that outer and inner are names for two groups into which we sort experiences according to the way in which they act upon their neighbors
5823,911-128684-0082.flac,take a mass of carion for example
5824,911-128684-0047.flac,is there and whether there for some one's consciousness or there for physical nature is a question not yet put at the moment it is there for neither later
5825,911-128684-0027.flac,with the objectors whom i began by citing that anger love and fear are affections purely of the mind
5826,911-128684-0017.flac,it is only towards certain specific groups of associates that the physical energies as we call them of a content are put forth in another group it may be quite inert
5827,911-128684-0022.flac,that their ampiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that subjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is aboriginally made of but of its classification
5828,911-128684-0038.flac,and the term indefinite while usually applied only to our apprehensions functions as a fundamental physical qualification of things in spencer's law of evolution
5829,911-128684-0015.flac,both cruel and tender therefore at once a mass in movement resists every force that operates contrariwise to its own direction but to forces that pursue the same direction or come in at right angles
5830,911-128684-0051.flac,the common sense stage of thought is a perfectly definite practical halting place the place where we ourselves can proceed to act unhesitatingly on this stage of thought
5831,911-128684-0088.flac,its viceral perturbations are my emotions the obstinate controversies that have arisen over such statements as these which sound so paradoxical and which can yet be made so seriously
5832,911-128684-0065.flac,its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands of physical nature chemical affinities are a purely verbal metaphor and as i just said
5833,8580-287363-0031.flac,and then when all was in readiness he began to call his home station he knew that either his father or mister jackson the engineer could receive the wireless
5834,8580-287363-0007.flac,that the colored man had had a method in his madness on his way back through the motor room tom looked to the machinery and adjusted some of the auxiliary oil feeders the various pieces of apparatus were working well
5835,8580-287363-0025.flac,and showing that scientist some of the manufactured diamonds getting our wireless apparatus in shape answered the lad i should have done it before but i had so much to do that i couldn't get at it
5836,8580-287363-0021.flac,and an alarm bell would sound in his stateroom when anything went wrong bless my napkin exclaimed mister damon the next morning as they sat down to a breakfast of fruit ham and eggs and fragrant coffee
5837,8580-287363-0015.flac,as he gazed at some weather instruments on the cabin wall bless my soul don't say that cried mister damon what is it i think from my observations that we will soon have a hurricane said the scientific man
5838,8580-287363-0026.flac,dad will want to know how we are doing as he worked away he also made up his mind to send another message in care of his father for there was a receiving station in the swift home and to whom this message was addressed tom did not say
5839,8580-287363-0010.flac,to where he hoped to discover the secret of phantom mountain how do you like it asked tom it's great replied the diamond man i've never been in an airship before and it's different than what i expected but it's great
5840,8580-287363-0027.flac,but we fancy some of our readers can guess finally after several hours of work the wireless was in shape to send and receive messages tom pulled over the lever and a crackling sound was heard
5841,8580-287363-0035.flac,there was a look of worriment father has just sent me a message he said it's a warning flashed through space he's been trying to get it to me since yesterday
5842,8580-287363-0029.flac,he was ready to serve his guests before he forwarded his own wireless notes jest tell my wife that i'm enjoying myself requested mister damon bless my footstool but this is great we're off the earth yet
5843,8580-287363-0002.flac,complimented mister parker is it always as easy as this starting always is was the answer though as the irishman said coming down isn't sometimes quite so comfortable bless my gizzard that's so
5844,8580-287363-0003.flac,cried the eccentric mister damon can we vall plane to earth in the red cloud tom yes but not as easily as in the butterfly however i hope we will not have to
5845,8580-287363-0009.flac,yes i can't imagine what made rad act that way but i'll set the automatic steering gear now mister damon and then you will be relieved mister jenks was gazing off toward the west
5846,8580-287363-0019.flac,and tom could not help wishing that the scientist would keep his gloomy forebodings to himself however the storm had not developed up to noon when tom with mister damon's help served a fine meal in the dining room in the afternoon the speed of the ship was increased
5847,8580-287363-0000.flac,rapidly the airship ascended and when it was high over the town of shopton tom headed the craft due west looking down he tried to descry mary nestor in her carriage but the trees were in the way
5848,8580-287363-0008.flac,though the engine had not yet been speeded up to its limit tom wanted it to warm up first everything all right asked mister damon as tom rejoined them in the pilot house which was just forward of the living room in the main cabin
5849,8580-287363-0017.flac,oh i think there will be no danger spoke tom if it comes on to blow we will ascend or descend out of the path of the storm this craft is not like the ill fated whizzer i can more easily handle the red cloud even in a bad storm
5850,8580-287363-0012.flac,guided by the automatic rudder so that no one was needed in the pilot house since there was no danger of collisions airships are not quite numerous enough for that yet though they may soon become so
5851,8580-287363-0016.flac,there is every indication of it and he seemed quite delighted at the prospect of his prediction coming true a hurricane cried mister damon i hope it isn't like the one that blew us to earthquake island
5852,8580-287363-0022.flac,and yet we are how far are we above the earth tom he asked turning to the young inventor about two miles now i just sent her up as i thought i detected that storm mister parker spoke of i told you it would come declared the scientist
5853,8580-287363-0013.flac,tom and the others devoted several hours to arranging their staterooms and bunks and getting their clothings stowed away and when this was done mister parker and mister jenks set gazing off into space it's hard to realize that we are really in an airship
5854,8580-287363-0018.flac,remarked mister jenks it would be too bad to be wrecked before we got to phantom mountain well i predict that we will have a bad storm insisted mister parker
5855,8580-287363-0028.flac,as the electricity leaped from the transmitters into space then he clamped the receiver on his ear all ready he announced has anybody any messages they wish sent for with the courtesy of a true host
5856,8580-287363-0023.flac,that morning but only the lower edge of it caught the red cloud and when tom sent her up still higher she found a comparatively quiet zone where she slid along at good speed
5857,8580-287363-0011.flac,it's the only craft that will serve our purpose among the towering mountain peaks where the diamond makers are hidden i hope we can find them in a little while the red cloud was skimming along at faster speed
5858,8580-287363-0001.flac,their interlocking branches hiding the girl tom did see crowds of other persons though thronging the streets of shopton for though the young inventor had made many flights there was always a novelty about them that brought out the curious
5859,8580-287363-0014.flac,observed the diamond man at first i thought i would be frightened but i'm not a bit it doesn't seem as if anything could happen something is likely to happen soon said mister parker suddenly
5860,8580-287363-0030.flac,connected with it mister jenks had no one to whom he wanted to send any word but mister parker wished to wire to a fellow scientist the result of some observations made in the upper air tom noted all the messages down
5861,8580-287363-0006.flac,looking from an after window and even going out on a small open platform but could discover nothing wrong i guess rad was just capering about without any special object mused tom
5862,8580-287363-0032.flac,but no sooner had the young inventor sent off the first few dots and dashes representing s i his home station call than he started and a look of surprise came over his face they're calling us he exclaimed who is
5863,8580-287363-0020.flac,and by night they had covered several hundred miles through the darkness the red cloud kept on making good time tom got up occasionally to look to the machinery
5864,8580-287363-0004.flac,now mister damon if you will just take charge of the steering apparatus for a minute i want to go aft what for i wish to see if everything is all right i can't imagine why eradicate was making those queer motions
5865,8580-287363-0024.flac,that afternoon tom busied himself about some wires in a number of complicated pieces of apparatus which were in one corner of the main cabin what are you doing now asked mister jenks who had been talking with mister parker
5866,8580-287363-0034.flac,gasped mister damon somewhat alarmed by tom's manner the lad did not answer at once he was intently listening to a series of dots and dashes that clicked in the telephone receiver clamped to his left ear on his face
5867,8580-287363-0033.flac,asked mister jenks my house my father he he's been trying to get us ever since we started but i didn't have the wireless in shape to receive messages oh i hope it's not too late too late bless my soul too late for what
5868,8580-287363-0005.flac,mister damon who knew how to operate the red cloud was soon guiding her on the course while tom made his way to the rear compartments through the motor room where the stores of supplies and food were kept he made a careful examination
5869,8580-287363-0036.flac,asked mister jenks rising from his seat the mysterious man is aboard the airship hidden away cried tom that's what eradicate was trying to call to our attention as we started off
5870,8580-287364-0044.flac,and then go on before you can send any word to your confederates we'll put you off in the most lonesome spot we can find and i guess you'll be some time getting back to civilization by that time we'll have the secret of the diamonds you never will
5871,8580-287364-0005.flac,he was looking from the rear storeroom window he's the same man who called on me that time rad remembers him very well bless my shoes what's to be done inquired mister damon looking around helplessly
5872,8580-287364-0036.flac,he was in with the diamond makers said mister jenks he was one of those who took me to the secret cave but it will be the last time he ever goes there how high up are we tom about two miles wy
5873,8580-287364-0028.flac,then i'll help you get it out bless my frying pan but i am very fond of lobster exclaimed mister damon in as natural tones as was possible under the circumstances
5874,8580-287364-0022.flac,the one finally adopted was that tom and mister damon should enter the storeroom casually as if in search of food to cook for supper they would discuss various dishes and mister damon was to express a preference for something in the food line
5875,8580-287364-0048.flac,was dropped off the airship when it was sent down to within a few feet of the earth it will take you some time to get to a telegraph office said mister jenks as a package of food and a flask of water was tossed down to the stowway
5876,8580-287364-0031.flac,a moment later the young inventor was bowled over as a dark figure leaped over his head catch him mister damon he cried bless my hat band iup mister damon's voice ended in a grunt he too had been knocked down by the fleeing man
5877,8580-287364-0002.flac,did eradicate see the man he says he did answered tom the man is hidden away on board now probably among the stores and supplies bless my tomata sauce exploded mister damon
5878,8580-287364-0047.flac,was considered a good one three days later in crossing over a lonely region near the nebraska national forest farley munson which was one of the names the spy went by
5879,8580-287364-0000.flac,chapter ten dropping the stowway tom's excited announcement startled mister damon and the others as much as if the young inventor had informed them that the airship had exploded
5880,8580-287364-0029.flac,he and tom moved cautiously back among the boxes and barrels they were glancing about with eager eyes tom switched on an electric light in the instant he did so
5881,8580-287364-0040.flac,hidd in the airship the stores were all in then and i stowed myself away among the boxes i had food and water so i didn't touch any of yours and he looked at mister damon who seemed much relieved and what was your object
5882,8580-287364-0015.flac,so unless he heard the wireless working and suspects something from that he probably doesn't know that we are aware of his presence aboard but why do you think he has remained quiet all this while tom asked mister damon
5883,8580-287364-0045.flac,declared the man firmly and he would say nothing more though by threats and promises mister jenks tried to get from him something about the men in with him and where the cave of the diamonds was located
5884,8580-287364-0004.flac,but he did not answer the scientist just then another communication was coming to him by wireless he listened intently father says the lad told his companions that eradicate only had a glimpse of the man at the last moment
5885,8580-287364-0027.flac,i think i'd like some of that canned lobster with french dressing on spoke the eccentric man that's a way in the back end of the room said tom in a loud voice it's under a lot of boxes
5886,8580-287364-0019.flac,and while we're about it give him a good scare when we do get him suggested mister jenks how asked tom threatened to drop him overboard perhaps that will make him tell how he happened to get in our ship
5887,8580-287364-0049.flac,he shook his fist at those in the airship and shouted after them you'll never discover the secret of phantom mountain
5888,8580-287364-0024.flac,said tom jump before he has a chance to use his gun mister jenks and mister parker will be waiting outside the room to catch him if he gets away from us i'll have some ropes ready and we'll tie him up and well we'll decide later what to do with him all right
5889,8580-287364-0016.flac,probably he wants to wait until the ship is farther out west suggested mister jenks then he will be nearer his friends and can get help if he needs it and do you really believe he would destroy the red cloud asked mister parker
5890,8580-287364-0042.flac,you must keep away from there and if we refuse asked tom then you'll have to take what comes but not from you exclaimed mister jenks we're going to get rid of you
5891,8580-287364-0037.flac,i guess that will be far enough to let him fall went on the diamond seeker come on mister damon help me throw him overboard you
5892,8580-287364-0034.flac,the cords were produced and the man who had now ceased to struggle was tightly bound he uttered not a word but he smiled grimly when mister damon remarked i guess i'll go back in the storeroom tom and see how much food he ate
5893,8580-287364-0001.flac,and was about to dash with them to the earth the men leaped to their feet and stared at the lad a stow away on board cried mister damon bless my soul how did he are you sure that message is straight asked mister jenks
5894,8580-287364-0009.flac,that's so cried tom we must try to capture him i think we had better the lad paused and again listened to the wireless message father says eradicate saw the man have a gun so we must be careful
5895,8580-287364-0010.flac,the young inventor translated the dots and dashes bless my powder horn exploded mister damon we shall have to proceed cautiously then spoke mister jenks
5896,8580-287364-0007.flac,that man is one of my enemies he has been sent by the band of diamond makers hidden among the mountains to spy on me and if possible prevent me from seeking to discover their secret
5897,8580-287364-0030.flac,he was aware of a movement in a little space formed by one box which was placed on top of two others the lad saw a dark figure moving as if to get farther out of sight i've got him cried tom making a die for the shadow
5898,8580-287364-0017.flac,i think that all he is waiting for is a favorable chance declared the diamond seeker he would destroy the craft and us too if he could prevent us from discovering the secret of phantom mountain i believe
5899,8580-287364-0003.flac,we must get him out at once declared mister jenks i knew something would happen on this voyage came from mister parker i predicted it from the first tom thought considerable
5900,8580-287364-0035.flac,he wasn't there long enough well farley munson so it's you is it asked mister jenks as he surveyed the prisoner do you know him asked tom in some surprise
5901,8580-287364-0006.flac,decided mister jenks with vigor get him out and drop him overboard drop him overboard cried mister parker in horror not exactly but get rid of him
5902,8580-287364-0013.flac,because a stray bullet might pierce the gas bag and damage the ship that's so agreed mister jenks well i guess if we go at it the right way we can capture him without any shooting but we must talk more quietly
5903,8580-287364-0041.flac,demanded mister jenks i wanted to prevent you from going to phantom mountain how by destroying the airship if need be but i hope to accomplish it by other means
5904,8580-287364-0012.flac,he inquired of tom yes was the hesitating answer but i don't want to use them if i can help it not only because of the danger and a dislike of shedding blood but
5905,8580-287364-0008.flac,he tried to work on tom swift's fears and frighten him from using his airship on this quest then when he failed the man must have sneaked into the shed and hidden himself in the ship we must get rid of him or he may wreck the red cloud
5906,8580-287364-0039.flac,how you got aboard and what your object was in coming that's easy enough i had been hanging around the shed for several days watching a chance to get in finally i saw it when that colored man went to feed his mule and i slipped in and
5907,8580-287364-0023.flac,the box containing which was well back in the room this would give the two a chance to penetrate to the far end of the apartment without arousing the suspicions of the hidden man who doubtless would be listening to the conversation and as soon as we get sight of him
5908,8580-287364-0046.flac,heavily bound with ropes the man was locked in a small closet to be kept there until a favorable spot was reached for letting him go mister jenks plan
5909,8580-287364-0021.flac,how are you going to capture him asked mister parker if he has a gun it won't be any too easy to go in the storeroom and drag him out we'll have to use a little strategy decided tom and then they discussed several plans
5910,8580-287364-0038.flac,throw me over with the airship two miles high are you gasped the man will you tell us what we want to know if we don't asked mister jenks
5911,8580-287364-0026.flac,whispered mister damon we'll soon find out answered tom let's go in they entered and in pursuance of their plan tom and his friend talked of various foods
5912,8580-287364-0043.flac,the man's face showed the alarm he felt oh don't worry said mister jenks quickly we're not going to toss you overboard
5913,8580-287364-0020.flac,and what are the plans of the gang of diamond makers we may get valuable information that way i don't believe you can scare such fellows much was tom's opinion
5914,8580-287364-0033.flac,while mister jenks held a gun that was still smoking we caught him cried the scientist anybody hurt asked tom anxiously no i knocked up his gun as he fired explained mister jenks where are the ropes tom
5915,8580-287364-0018.flac,then we must get ahead of him decided tom quietly i have just flashed to dad a message telling him that we will heed his warning now to capture the stowaway
5916,8580-287364-0014.flac,he may have heard us i don't think so replied tom the storeroom is far enough off so that he couldn't hear us besides the motor makes such a racket that he couldn't distinguish what we were talking about even if he heard our voices
5917,8580-287364-0032.flac,look out mister jenks cried tom to warn those on guard at the door of the storeroom there was the report of a gun some excited shouts and when tom could scramble to his feet and rush out he beheld mister parker calmly sitting on a struggling man
5918,8580-287364-0011.flac,if he is like any others in the gang he is a desperate man better sneak up on him then if we can proposed mister parker there are enough of us to cope with one man even if he is armed
5919,8580-287364-0025.flac,i'm ready as soon as you are tom said the eccentric man come ahead they went softly to the storeroom and listened at the door there was no sound heard save that made by the machinery i wonder if he's really here
5920,332-128985-0021.flac,when that bushy bearded pirate was running a muc in the streets but if he had it is not probable that this book would have been written he assures us that when roc was not drunk he was esteemed but at the same time feared
5921,332-128985-0054.flac,and he determined to get rid of him as soon as possible he felt himself in the position of a man who has stolen a baby bear and who hears the roar of an approaching parent through the woods
5922,332-128985-0012.flac,his eyebrows were enormously large and bushy and from under them he glared at his mundane surroundings he was not a man whose spirit could be quelled by looking him steadfastly in the eye it was his custom in the daytime to walk about
5923,332-128985-0052.flac,and he was very anxious that nothing of the kind should happen again there was no great spanish force in the harbour at the time and he did not know how many buccaneering vessels might be able to gather together in the bay
5924,332-128985-0039.flac,and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any roc had plenty of wit and he used it well there was a slave probably not a negro nor a native
5925,332-128985-0010.flac,but i do not believe it is an easy thing to frighten a child into going to sleep if i found it necessary to make a youngster take a nap i should say nothing of the condition of affairs in cuba or of the persecutions of the armenians
5926,332-128985-0087.flac,but which are necessary to make up the true character of a pirate the historian john seems to have been very much cut up by the manner in which his favorite hero had rounded off his piratical career
5927,332-128985-0025.flac,then there was nothing for them to do but go on board their vessels and put out to sea in search of some fresh prize so far roc's career had been very much like that of many other companions of the coast
5928,332-128985-0060.flac,by allowing them to associate with such wicked companions as frenchman and roc made no suggestion of the kind knowing very well how greatly astonished the french captain would be if the governor were to communicate with him on the subject
5929,332-128985-0011.flac,this renowned pirate from brazil must have been a terrible fellow to look at he was strong and brawny his face was short and very wide with high cheek bones and his expression probably resembled that of a pug dog
5930,332-128985-0078.flac,and they were therefore greatly dismayed when a party of horsemen from the town who had made a wide detour through the woods suddenly charged upon their rear
5931,332-128985-0015.flac,but although he was so strict and exacting during the business sessions of his piratical year by which i mean when he was cruising around after prizes he was very much more disagreeable when he was taking a vacation
5932,332-128985-0017.flac,with his cutlass waving high in the air he would rush out into the street and take a whack at every one whom he met as far as was possible the citizens allowed him to have the street to himself and it was not at all likely
5933,332-128985-0020.flac,in his nature there was no alloy nor moderation nor forbearance the appreciative esquemelling who might be called the boswell of the buccaneers could never have met his hero roc
5934,332-128985-0059.flac,there is no doubt that our buccaneers would have much preferred to have been put on board the french vessel but as the spanish governor had started his prisoners on the road to reform he did not wish to throw them into the way of temptation
5935,332-128985-0030.flac,but he chose to go himself and he came to grief no sooner did the people on the ships lying in the harbour behold a boat approaching with a big browed broad jawed mariner sitting on the stern
5936,332-128985-0055.flac,to throw away the cub and walk off as though he had no idea there were any bears in that forest would be the inclination of a man so situated and to get rid of the great pirate without provoking the vengeance of his friends
5937,332-128985-0079.flac,tributor and a great many of the pirates were killed or taken and roc the brazilian had a terrible fall this most memorable fall occurred in the estimation of john esquemeling
5938,332-128985-0033.flac,when the pirate captain and his companions were brought before the governor he made no pretence of putting them to trial buccaneers were outlawed by the spanish
5939,332-128985-0084.flac,but this downfall of a hero simply shows that esquemeling although he was a member of the piratical body and was proud to consider himself a buccaneer did not understand the true nature of a pirate under the brutality
5940,332-128985-0042.flac,and the first thing he did was to bring some writing materials to roc who thereupon began the composition of a letter
5941,332-128985-0026.flac,differing from them only in respect to intensity and force but he was a clever man with ideas
5942,332-128985-0019.flac,from the time he had been able to assert his individuality he had been a pirate and there was no reason to suppose that he would ever reform himself into anything else there were no extenuating circumstances in this case
5943,332-128985-0063.flac,that the captain allowed him to serve as one of the crew roc knew how to do a great many things not only could he murder and rob but he knew how to turn an honest penny when there was no other way of filling his purse he had learned among the indians
5944,332-128985-0043.flac,when he was coming into the bay roc had noticed a large french vessel that was lying at some distance from the town
5945,332-128985-0000.flac,we will pass to the consideration of a regular out and out pirate one from whose mast head would have floated the black flag with its skull and cross bones if that emblematic piece of bunting had been in use by the pirates of the period
5946,332-128985-0027.flac,he was cruising about campeachy without seeing any craft that was worth capturing
5947,332-128985-0009.flac,this story however i regard with a great deal of doubt
5948,332-128985-0023.flac,but in all the instances of ferocious enmity toward the spaniards there has been nothing to equal the feelings of roc the brazilian upon that subject his dislike to everything spanish arose he declared
5949,332-128985-0040.flac,who came in to bring him food and drink and by the means of this man the pirate hoped to play a trick upon the governor he promised the slave that if he would help him and he told him it would be very easy to do so
5950,332-128985-0077.flac,in a marine combat it is seldom that a party of boarders is attacked in the rear by the enemy although on land such methods of warfare may always be expected
5951,332-128985-0086.flac,under certain circumstances he showed himself to have all those brave and savage qualities which esquemeling esteemed and revered and under other circumstances he showed those other qualities which esquemeling despised
5952,332-128985-0046.flac,or upon the town of campeachy should be taken as soon as possible after he should hear of any injury that might be inflicted upon the unfortunate men who were then lying imprisoned in the fortress when the slave came back to roc
5953,332-128985-0032.flac,roc must have had a great deal of confidence in his own powers or perhaps he relied somewhat upon the fear which his very presence evoked but he made a mistake this time he had run into the lion's jaw and the lion had closed his teeth upon him
5954,332-128985-0003.flac,that he was destined to become a most remarkable sea robber he was offered the command of a ship with a well armed crew of marine savages
5955,332-128985-0066.flac,in every way roc behaved so well that for his sake all his men were treated kindly and allowed many privileges but when this party of reformed pirates reached spain and were allowed to go where they pleased
5956,332-128985-0074.flac,if they could do this it would be an easy matter to rush upon the unsuspecting garrison and having annihilated these make themselves masters of the town but their plans did not work very well they were discovered by some indians
5957,332-128985-0081.flac,by ignonimously running away the loyal chronicler had as firm a belief in the absolute inability of his hero to fly from danger as was shown by the scottish douglas when he stood
5958,332-128985-0073.flac,in yucatan and although this was a bold and rash undertaking the two pirates were bold and rash enough for anything roc had been a prisoner in merida and on account of his knowledge of the town he believed that he and his followers could land upon the coast
5959,332-128985-0016.flac,on his return to jamaica after one of his expeditions it was his habit to give himself some relaxation after the hardships and dangers through which he had passed and on such occasions it was a great comfort to roc to get himself thoroughly drunk
5960,332-128985-0024.flac,seems to have been that there was nothing too bad for a spaniard the object of his life was to wage bitter war against spanish ships and spanish settlements he seldom gave any quarter to his prisoners
5961,332-128985-0014.flac,would probably have felt the edge of that cutlass descending rapidly through his physical organism he was a man who insisted upon being obeyed and if any one of his crew behaved improperly or was even found idle
5962,332-128985-0028.flac,and find out whether or not there were any spanish vessels in the bay which were well laden and which were likely soon to come out so with a small boat filled with some of his trusty men he rowed quietly into the port to see what he could discover
5963,332-128985-0008.flac,that roc now became famous the better he became known the more general was the fear and respect felt for him and we are told that the mothers of the islands used to put their children to sleep by threatening them with the terrible roc if they did not close their eyes
5964,332-128985-0035.flac,during the time that preparations were going on for making examples of these impertinent pirates
5965,332-128985-0061.flac,on the voyage to spain roc was on his good behavior and he was a man who knew how to behave very well when it was absolutely necessary no doubt there must have been many dull days on board ship
5966,332-128985-0037.flac,or jumping overboard with a couple of wine jars for a life preserver or of doing any of those ordinary things which pirates were in the habit of doing when escaping from their captors
5967,332-128985-0002.flac,he never had an intention of being anything else as soon as he grew to be a man he became a bloody buccaneer and at the first opportunity he joined a pirate crew and had made but a few voyages when it was perceived by his companions
5968,332-128985-0056.flac,was the natural inclination of the governor now roc and his men were treated well and having been brought before the governor were told that in consequence of their having committed no overt act of disorder they would be set at liberty and shipped to england
5969,332-128985-0007.flac,he could not have been more enthusiastic in his praises and as in the arabian nights the roc is described as the greatest of birds so in the eyes of the buccaneer biographer this roc was the greatest of pirates
5970,332-128985-0069.flac,not only did roc cast from him every thought of reformation and a respectable life but he determined to begin the business of piracy on a grander scale than ever before he made a compact with an old french buccaneer
5971,332-128985-0038.flac,inside of a fortress and if they escaped from this they would find themselves unarmed in the midst of a body of spanish soldiers their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them now
5972,332-128985-0018.flac,that his visits to jamaica were looked forward to with any eager anticipations roc it may be said was not only a bloody pirate but a blooded one he was a thoroughbred
5973,332-128985-0075.flac,after they had landed who hurried to merida and gave notice of the approach of the buccaneers consequently when roc and his companions reached the town they found the garrison prepared for them cannons loaded and all the approaches guarded
5974,332-128985-0068.flac,but as soon as they could manage it they sailed back to the west indies and eventually found themselves in jamaica
5975,332-128985-0034.flac,and were considered as wild beasts to be killed without mercy whenever caught consequently roc and his men were thrown into a dungeon and condemned to be executed if however the spanish governor had known what was good for himself
5976,332-128985-0076.flac,still the pirates did not hesitate they advanced fiercely to the attack just as they were accustomed to do when they were boarding a spanish vessel but they soon found that fighting on land was very different from fighting at sea
5977,332-128985-0053.flac,if it should become known that the great pirate roc had been put to death in campeachey it was an unusual thing for a prisoner to have such powerful friends so near by and the governor took roc's case into most earnest consideration
5978,332-128985-0048.flac,and early in the morning he was to return as if he had been walking along the shore of the harbor when he was to state that he had been put on shore from the french vessel in the offing with a letter which he was to present to the governor the slave performed his part of the business very well
5979,332-128985-0029.flac,and had sent that mild mannered observer into the harbor to investigate into the state of affairs
5980,332-128985-0082.flac,come one come all the bushy browed pirate of the drawn cutlass
5981,332-128985-0070.flac,and with a large company of buccaneers he actually set out to take a town having lost everything he possessed and having passed such a long time without any employment more profitable than that of shooting fish with a bow and arrows
5982,332-128985-0072.flac,from the active practice of this profession
5983,332-128985-0047.flac,the letter was given to him with very particular directions as to what he was to do with it he was to disguise himself as much as possible so that he should not be recognized by the people of the place and then in the night he was to make his way out of the town
5984,332-128985-0049.flac,the next day wet and bedraggled from making his way through the weeds and mud of the coast he presented himself at the fortress with his letter and when he was allowed to take it to the governor no one suspected that he was a person employed about the place
5985,332-128985-0041.flac,he would give him money enough to buy his freedom and to return to his friends and this of course was a great inducement to the poor fellow who may have been an englishman or a frenchman in good circumstances at home the slave agreed to the proposals
5986,332-128985-0006.flac,who had no sympathy with pirates and as for esquemeling he simply worshipped the great brazilian desperado if he had been writing the life and times of alexander the great julius caesar or mister gladstone
5987,332-128985-0044.flac,by the hand of roc went on to say that if any harm should come to these brave men who had been taken and imprisoned when they were doing no harm to anybody he would swear in his most solemn manner that never
5988,332-128985-0045.flac,for the rest of his life would he give quarter to any spaniard who might fall into his hands and he moreover threatened that any kind of vengeance which should become possible for the buccaneers and the french united to inflict upon the spanish ships
5989,332-128985-0036.flac,this was a branch of the business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient if he could not get himself out of scrapes he could not expect to be successful in this case there was no chance of cutting down sentinels
5990,332-128985-0005.flac,his talents for the conduct of great piratical operations soon became apparent and he was generally acknowledged as the head pirate of the west indies he was now looked upon as a hero even by those colonists
5991,332-128985-0071.flac,our doughty pirate now desired to make a grand strike and if he could take a town and pillage it of everything valuable it contained he would make a very good fortune in a very short time and might retire if he chose
5992,332-128985-0013.flac,carrying a drawn cutlass resting easily upon his arm edge up very much as a fine gentleman carries his high silk hat and anyone who should impertinently stare or endeavour to quell his high spirits in any other way
5993,332-128985-0062.flac,when he would have been delighted to gamble to get drunk and to run a muck up and down the deck but he carefully abstained from all these recreations and showed himself to be such an able bodied and willing sailor
5994,332-128985-0001.flac,and his own was unknown and the brazilian because he was born in brazil though of dutch parents unlike most of his fellow practitioners he did not gradually become a pirate from his early youth
5995,332-128985-0022.flac,but there are various ways of gaining esteem and roc's method certainly succeeded very well in the case of his literary associate as we have seen the hatred of the spaniards by the buccaneers began very early in the settlement of the west indies
5996,332-128985-0064.flac,how to shoot fish with bow and arrows and on this voyage across the atlantic he occupied all his spare time in sitting in the rigging and shooting the fish which disported themselves about the vessel
5997,332-128985-0057.flac,upon the single condition that they would abandon piracy and agree to become quiet citizens in whatever respectable vocation they might select to these terms roc and his men agreed without argument
5998,332-128985-0058.flac,they declared that they would retire from the buccaneering business and that nothing would suit them better than to return to the ways of civilization and virtue there was a ship about to depart for spain and on this the governor gave roc and his men free passage to the other side of the ocean
5999,332-128985-0031.flac,and with a good many more broad backed hairy mariners than were necessary pulling at the oars then they gave the alarm
6000,332-128985-0050.flac,having fulfilled his mission he departed and when seen again he was the same servant whose business it was to carry food to the prisoners the governor read the letter with a disquieted mind
6001,332-128985-0083.flac,who would even surrender to say nothing of running away that esquemeling could scarcely believe that roc had retreated from his enemies deserted his friends and turned his back upon the principles which he had always so trucelently proclaimed
6002,332-128985-0004.flac,he fell in with a spanish ship loaded with silver bullion having captured this he sailed with his prize to jamaica which was one of the great resorts of the english buccaneers there his success delighted the community
6003,332-128985-0051.flac,he knew that the french ship which was lying outside the harbor was a powerful vessel and he did not like french ships anyway the town had once been taken and very badly treated by a little fleet of french and english buccaneers
6004,332-128985-0088.flac,and after that he entirely dropped roc from his chronicles
6005,332-128985-0065.flac,these fish he sold to the officers and we are told that in this way he earned no less than five hundred crowns perhaps that many dollars if this account is true fish must have been very costly in those days
6006,332-128985-0085.flac,the cruelty the dishonesty and the recklessness of the sea robbers of those days there was nearly always meanness and cowardice roc as we have said in the beginning of this sketch was a typical pirate
6007,332-128985-0080.flac,who knew all about the attack on merida and who wrote the account of it but he had never expected to be called upon to record that his great hero roc the brazilian saved his life after the utter defeat of himself and his companions
6008,332-128985-0067.flac,they thought no more of the oaths they had taken to abandon piracy than they thought of the oaths which they had been in the habit of throwing right and left
6009,1355-39947-0057.flac,ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere it must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce
6010,1355-39947-0097.flac,there is too much or too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal
6011,1355-39947-0008.flac,is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain it is indeed a frequent symptom in paranoya and other insanities that the patient who feels abnormal organic sensations and abnormal unaccountable impulses interprets them as influences of a distant enemy
6012,1355-39947-0017.flac,belonging therefore entirely to the purposive view of the mind but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purposive view too as long as we discussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician
6013,1355-39947-0086.flac,yes the artificial reinforcement of such special features would deprive education of that which is the most essential namely the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy
6014,1355-39947-0068.flac,criminal on some other objections which interest the community as such we had to touch before and there is no need of returning to them with any fulness of argument we spoke of the danger which the mental cures carry with them when they are based on any particular creed
6015,1355-39947-0069.flac,what is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism
6016,1355-39947-0050.flac,and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital and yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist we do not eliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path
6017,1355-39947-0078.flac,the fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed to the background and that thus the church
6018,1355-39947-0075.flac,even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudo philosophy stands behind the therapeutic work the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior
6019,1355-39947-0011.flac,but if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life we should give up social life itself suggestion is given wherever men come in contact in itself it is neither good nor bad the good resolution and the bad one can be suggested
6020,1355-39947-0036.flac,morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task in our discussion of the mental symptoms i reported as an illustration of the suggestive treatment of the drug passion
6021,1355-39947-0066.flac,if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself science has the right to make hypnotic experiments or experiments with abnormal mental states only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health
6022,1355-39947-0030.flac,it is quite true that if i hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awakening the book which lies on my table he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom he feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and
6023,1355-39947-0081.flac,society does not only ask where psychical treatment can be dangerous but asks with not less right whether the scheme and the method might not be fructified for other social ends besides the mere healing of the sick if psychotherapy demonstrates that for instance
6024,1355-39947-0000.flac,psychotherapy and the community both the physician and the patient find their place in the community the life interests of which are superior to the interests of the individual
6025,1355-39947-0047.flac,these reductions of the dose were made a week apart and sometimes only two days the worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each which was about january tenth
6026,1355-39947-0060.flac,the possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs or of creating unintentionally by suggestion
6027,1355-39947-0024.flac,profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create more than this they have to acknowledge it to gain a basis for their attack just because the hypnotizer can entirely change the desires and passions the habits and perversities of the suffering victim
6028,1355-39947-0035.flac,is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments to make a man fight where despair is inevitable and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers can certainly not be the moral demand
6029,1355-39947-0090.flac,and now that under the influence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained from mastering the next lesson in the same way some naughty traits might be artificially removed but the child would not gain anything towards the much more important power
6030,1355-39947-0058.flac,ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skilful use to hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous if it is done by the unfit
6031,1355-39947-0020.flac,this opposition argues as follows hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom whatever the patient may reach in the altered states is reached without his own effort while he is the passive receiver
6032,1355-39947-0053.flac,if it were really a moral demand that the will be left to its own resources and that no outside influence come to strengthen its power or remove its hindrance or smooth its path then we ought to let the children grow up as nature created them
6033,1355-39947-0064.flac,all that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist as such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment and a psychological clinic managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine
6034,1355-39947-0051.flac,we have no mystic power by which our will simply takes hold of the other man's will but we inhibit and suppress by influence on the imagination those abnormal impulses which resist the sound desires if that were immoral
6035,1355-39947-0055.flac,to patriotism and religion increases the degree of suggestibility that is the glory of life that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion
6036,1355-39947-0084.flac,there can be no doubt that the possibility of such remodelling activity is given but as far as education is concerned certainly grave misgivings ought to be felt when we spoke of the treatment of the sick
6037,1355-39947-0071.flac,any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion the intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering
6038,1355-39947-0041.flac,i finally went to the sanitarium of doctor
6039,1355-39947-0082.flac,hypnotism makes possible the reshaping of a pathological mind it is a natural thought to use the same power for remodelling perhaps the lazy or the intemperate the careless or the inattentive the dishonest or the criminal mind
6040,1355-39947-0095.flac,but the conception of the born criminal is also only a label which is superficially used for a great variety of minds that men are born with a brain which necessarily produces criminal actions is not indicated by any facts
6041,1355-39947-0037.flac,the case of a morphinist to make clear this purposive side of the case as against the causal one which alone interested the physician i may add a few features to the short report as a typical example
6042,1355-39947-0003.flac,one which is perhaps most often heard in popular circles results from an entire misunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed study of the processes involved it is claimed that suggestive power especially in the form of
6043,1355-39947-0070.flac,that is indeed one of the central dangers of all nonmedical suggestive cures that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth
6044,1355-39947-0043.flac,three doses of three grains a day i took my hypodermic as directed but on the following day i lay on the bed too exhausted to get up even to get around the room and i could not eat
6045,1355-39947-0032.flac,but after a long experience i have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts on the contrary
6046,1355-39947-0042.flac,when i first went to see the professor in the harvard psychological laboratory i was using between thirty two and thirty eight grains of morphine daily he put me under his treatment october sixth and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine grains a day or
6047,1355-39947-0087.flac,wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits
6048,1355-39947-0046.flac,i was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again
6049,1355-39947-0044.flac,the desire for the drug was something terrible but in about four days i got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where i spent twenty two hours of the twenty four on the bed
6050,1355-39947-0045.flac,but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day
6051,1355-39947-0048.flac,at this time i had the worst two days of my life i tried whiskey but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then the desire was worse than ever
6052,1355-39947-0025.flac,he seems to them a moral wrong doer who negates the principle of human freedom a forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist the great psychological crime it says to the hypnotist
6053,1355-39947-0001.flac,it is an unavoidable question how far from the higher point of view of the social mind the psychotherapeutic efforts should be encouraged or suppressed are there any conditions which suggest suspicion of or direct opposition to such curative work
6054,1355-39947-0009.flac,whole pamphlets have been written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations and requests to legislatures have been made in that spirit but the physician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the well known phenomena of the mental disease
6055,1355-39947-0033.flac,every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight his own will is a presupposition for being hypnotized
6056,1355-39947-0077.flac,still more that is true of the healing of the sick whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the whole community
6057,1355-39947-0076.flac,the community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non religious work social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit
6058,1355-39947-0096.flac,the varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions we recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements but is characterized only by a change of proportions
6059,1355-39947-0056.flac,and he who by suggestion helps the weak mind to overcome obstacles which the strong mind can overthrow from its inborn resources works for the good of the individual and of the community in the spirit of truest morality much more justified than such
6060,1355-39947-0054.flac,and ought not to try to suppress from without by discipline and training by love and encouragement the wilful impulses and the ugly habits even every good model for imitation is such a suggestive influence from without and every solemn appeal to loyalty and friendship
6061,1355-39947-0023.flac,no one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the
6062,1355-39947-0034.flac,if again and again i hesitate to undertake new cases it is just because i have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses the joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients
6063,1355-39947-0039.flac,in truth it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling he had been for years a slave to his passion to quote from his little autobiography when i realized that i was addicted to morphine
6064,1355-39947-0092.flac,psychotherapy has its right the feeble minded and the retarded child the perverse child and the emotionally unstable child belong under the care of the physician
6065,1355-39947-0085.flac,we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not diseases in the same way hypnotic suggestion might reinforce a single trait but it would not reform the personality of the child
6066,1355-39947-0072.flac,had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of missus eddy's science and health from a cultural viewpoint too suggestive therepeutics must stand the higher the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines
6067,1355-39947-0029.flac,but because it is an error as to the facts such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy
6068,1355-39947-0021.flac,his achievement has therefore no moral value and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits of his misuse of cocane or of his criminal tendencies he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent it would be better
6069,1355-39947-0005.flac,the hypnotist is believed to have mystic power to bring any person in a distant region under his mental control and thus to be able to carry out any sinister plans by the help of his innocent victim all hypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state
6070,1355-39947-0019.flac,draw the practical consequences of a naturalistic view of the mind without inquiring whether or not serious interests in the purposive sphere are injured if there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy it is the duty of the community to consider it
6071,1355-39947-0027.flac,you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend in proportion as you deprive him of the free control and exercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend
6072,1355-39947-0022.flac,if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined no one ought to take such arguments lightly the spirit which directs them is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for superficial goods
6073,1355-39947-0059.flac,we have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister but we can extend this fear to any one who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology
6074,1355-39947-0091.flac,of suppressing an ugly tendency by his own effort all that finds its limits where the inhibitions or obstacles in the brain of the child are too strong possibly to be overcome by the own good will but in that case
6075,1355-39947-0015.flac,any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions what he needs is training in firmness the application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him
6076,1355-39947-0013.flac,their expression awakens confidence their voice in their words reach deeper layers of the mind their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the antagonistic ideas
6077,1355-39947-0016.flac,no possible source of danger on a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and which are not without sympathy with true science in recent times this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression it is an objection from the standpoint of morality
6078,1355-39947-0080.flac,that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one but the interest of the community is not only a negative one
6079,1355-39947-0014.flac,but the chief difference lies after all in the different degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such impressions the easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict he may catch suggestions everywhere
6080,1355-39947-0038.flac,when that man left my laboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness you might well have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and pleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the dangerous desire for morphine
6081,1355-39947-0093.flac,which are at his disposal still more complex is the criminological problem it sounds like an easy remedy for the greatest social calamity if it is proposed simply to hypnotize the criminal and to supplant his antisocial will by a moral one
6082,1355-39947-0065.flac,is certainly not better than a church clinic i cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiment's sake nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind
6083,1355-39947-0052.flac,we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements every sound respect for authority which makes a child willing to accept the advice and maxims of his elders is just such an influence
6084,1355-39947-0073.flac,no theory of the world and of god ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effects freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician
6085,1355-39947-0083.flac,both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions and social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for social movements in future times
6086,1355-39947-0062.flac,would also be a rather poor agent of psychotherapeutic methods but the probability is that such a physician would simply abstain by principle from all psychotherapeutic methods his mistake only begins if from his lack of acquaintance with the subject
6087,1355-39947-0007.flac,the imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will the story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public
6088,1355-39947-0026.flac,by your own testimony you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self control in proportion as you deprive him of the power of self control
6089,1355-39947-0049.flac,he was thus at every moment during the day and night in full possession of the deadly poison with which he could have fully satisfied his craving it was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine
6090,1355-39947-0010.flac,to be sure while no one can be hypnotized against his will many a person is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out the wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without willing that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own motives
6091,1355-39947-0089.flac,i have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits such as the habit of biting the nails a child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this
6092,1355-39947-0067.flac,and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as
6093,1355-39947-0088.flac,in the form of good example and persuasions authority and discipline love and sympathy that holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure for instance
6094,1355-39947-0063.flac,he draws the conclusion that the method itself is undesirable that his real preparation ought to include psychological studies we have pointed out before and the time seems ripe for the community to urge such a reform of the studies
6095,1355-39947-0002.flac,of course society has to be sure that no possible misuse and damage are to result from such practice fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly but from very different standpoints
6096,1355-39947-0074.flac,who does not need the strong religious reinforcement of the suggestion because he reenforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses
6097,1355-39947-0079.flac,in imitating that which others can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which the church alone can do the final outcome is therefore practically in every way the same from whatever starting point we may come we are led to the conviction
6098,1355-39947-0031.flac,as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book
6099,1355-39947-0040.flac,that is coming to anyone who is a user of opium or any of its alkaloids for the first few months i found great relief after every injection of morphine but soon i could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep i got was in the daytime
6100,1355-39947-0061.flac,injurious effects are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work certainly there is no physician who is not liable to make mistakes and a physician who has never given any attention to psychology and psychiatry
6101,1355-39947-0094.flac,and if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the born criminal even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached
6102,1355-39947-0004.flac,hypnotization may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent often this is coupled with telepathic fancies
6103,1355-39947-0018.flac,no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question as soon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community it becomes our duty to bring the causal and the purposive view into harmony and it would be narrow and shortsighted simply to
6104,1355-39947-0006.flac,the presuppositions of such a view are as we know now entirely absurd we know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism
6105,1355-39947-0028.flac,you thereby rob him of those powers upon which he must depend for the achievement of individual immortality but this censure too is entirely mistaken not because it urges the purposive views against the causal
6106,1355-39947-0012.flac,the good example and the bad can be effective both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique certainly there are some persons who have a stronger influence than others on the imagination of those with whom they come in contact
6107,3807-4923-0004.flac,frightened as she was the prison bred child was as much astonished at hearing convicts cheer as a fashionable lady would be to hear her footman quote poetry bates however practical and calm took quite another view of the case
6108,3807-4923-0009.flac,lesley and another burst into a laugh at this wild proposition but rex who had weighed his chances well beforehand felt the force of the pilot's speech and answered seriously it's no use talking he said shaking his still handsome head
6109,3807-4923-0030.flac,and the glimmering water was visible a white speck which gradually neared them come alongside with ye hailed a voice or it will be the worse for ye they want to murder us says frere give way men
6110,3807-4923-0026.flac,and a dozen such as ye the brig's hours can't ye see and we're your masters now frere stifling an exclamation of rage cried to the bow to hook on but the bow had driven the boat backward and she was already beyond arm's length of the brig
6111,3807-4923-0051.flac,which is it to be we'll go with you says the man who had pulled the stroke in the whale boat spitting into the water with averted face upon which utterance the convicts burst into joyous oaths and the pair were received with much handshaking
6112,3807-4923-0038.flac,he had feared that the child was injured by the direction of rex the whale boat was brought alongside the jolly boat and cheshire and lesly boarded her
6113,3807-4923-0039.flac,frere attempted to resist this indignity but cheshire cclapping his musket to his ear swore he would blow out his brains if he uttered another syllable frere catching the malignant eye of john rex
6114,3807-4923-0033.flac,but a few minutes before would have risked his life to obey orders of his officer did more than an hour's reasoning to convince maurice frere of the hopelessness of resistance his authority
6115,3807-4923-0020.flac,that john rex was a greater man at that moments than john bates as missus vickers descended the hatchway the boat with frere and the soldiers came within musket range and lesly according to orders fired his musket over their heads
6116,3807-4923-0037.flac,and a loaded musket across his knees the white object which had been seen by the men in the whale boat was a large white shawl which wrapped missus vickers and sylvia
6117,3807-4923-0024.flac,and poise it on the rail their intention was but too evident and honest bates like a faithful watch dog barked to warn his master bloodthirsty cheshire caught him by the throat and frere unheeding
6118,3807-4923-0027.flac,looking up he saw cheshire's savage face and heard the click of the lock as he cocked his piece the two soldiers exhausted by their long pull made no effort to stay the progress of the boat
6119,3807-4923-0001.flac,clung to her mother with one hand and with the other pressed close to her little bosom the english history in her all absorbing fear she had forgotten to lay it down
6120,3807-4923-0010.flac,we have got the brig and we mean to keep her i can navigate her though i am no seaman so you needn't talk further about it mister bates it's liberty we require what are you going to do with us asked bates leave you behind bates face blanched
6121,3807-4923-0011.flac,what here yes it don't look a picturesque spot does it and yet i've lived here for some years and he grinned bates was silent the logic of that grin was unanswerable come cried the dandy shaking off his momentary melancholy
6122,3807-4923-0049.flac,and revived in the minds of the pair already disposed to break the yoke that sat so heavily upon them a train of dismal memories the life of a soldier on a convict station was at that time a hard one he was often stinted in rations
6123,3807-4923-0041.flac,fell pinioned as he was he could not rise without assistance and russen pulled him roughly to his feet with a coarse laugh in his present frame of mind that laugh galled him worse than his bonds
6124,3807-4923-0028.flac,the deck of the offspry had become invisible in the darkness frere struck his fist upon the thwart in sheer impotence of rage the scoundrels he said between his teeth they've mastered us what do they mean to do next
6125,3807-4923-0015.flac,frightened let me pass prisoner the whole deck burst into a great laugh at this and poor missus vickers paused trembling for the consequences of the child's temerity to thus taunt the desperate convict who held their lives in his hands seemed sheer madness
6126,3807-4923-0008.flac,fools he cried do you know what you are about to do you will never escape give up the brig and i will declare before my god upon the bible that i will say nothing but give all good characters
6127,3807-4923-0019.flac,your daughter has her father's spirit madam said he to missus vickers with a bow bates opened his mouth to listen his ears were not large enough to take in the words of this complimentary convict he began to think that he was the victim of a nightmare he absolutely felt
6128,3807-4923-0002.flac,and shuddering shook her head the men above swore impatiently at the delay and the three hastened on deck who's to command the brig now asked undaunted bates as they came up i am said john rex
6129,3807-4923-0005.flac,the bold project so boldly avowed seemed to him a sheer absurdity the dandy and a crew of nine convicts navigate a brig round the world preposterous why not a man aboard could work a reckoning
6130,3807-4923-0052.flac,then rex with lion and riley as a guard got into the whale boat and having loosed the two prisoners from their bonds ordered them to take the place of russen and fare the whale boat was manned by the seven mutineers
6131,3807-4923-0018.flac,and rex dared not vent his passion on so helpless an object as men do in such cases he veiled his anger beneath an affectation of amusement in order to show that he was not moved by the taunt he smiled upon the taunter more graciously than ever
6132,3807-4923-0000.flac,missus vickers pale and sick with terror yet sustained by that strange courage of which we have before spoken passed rapidly under the open skylight and prepared to ascend sylvia her romance crushed by too dreadful reality
6133,3807-4923-0035.flac,it seemed to him that virtue had gone out of it when they reached the brig they found that the jolly boat had been lowered and laid alongside in her were eleven persons bates with forehead gashed and hands bound the stunned grimes
6134,3807-4923-0029.flac,the answer came pat to the question from the dark hull of the brig broke a flash and a report and a musket ball cut the water beside them with a chirping noise between the black indistinct mass which represented the brig
6135,3807-4923-0014.flac,run down with your mamma and don't be frightened sylvia flashed burning red at this indignity frightened
6136,3807-4923-0036.flac,russen and fair pulling lyon riley cheshire and lesly with muskets and john rex in the stern sheets
6137,3807-4923-0017.flac,the generic name of convicts made him bite his lips with rage had he had his will he would have struck the little creature to the deck but the hoarse laugh of his companions warned him to forbear there is public opinion even among convicts
6138,3807-4923-0054.flac,keep your distance shouted cheshire as frere and bates in obedience to orders began to pull the jolly boat towards the shore and in this fashion was the dismal little party conveyed to the mainland it was night when they reached it
6139,3807-4923-0045.flac,mister frere purple clumsy and bound was not at all heroic now my lad says rex who seemed to have endured the cast off authority of frere we give you your choice stay at hell'sgates or come with us
6140,3807-4923-0016.flac,in the boldness of the speech however lay its safeguard rex whose politeness was mere bravado was stung to the quick by the reflection upon his courage and the bitter accent with which the child had pronounced the word prisoner
6141,3807-4923-0003.flac,and with these brave fellows i'll take her round the world the touch of bombast was not out of place it jumped so far with the humor of the convicts that they set up a feeble cheer at which sylvia frowned
6142,3807-4923-0012.flac,look alive there lower away the jolly boat missus vickers go down to your cabin and get anything you want
6143,3807-4923-0006.flac,his nautical fancy pictured the owsprey helplessly rolling on a swell of the southern ocean or hopelessly locked in the ice of the antarctic seas and he dimly guessed at the fate of the deluded ten
6144,3807-4923-0050.flac,and of necessity deprived of all rational recreation while punishment for offences was prompt and severe the companies drafted to the penal settlements were not composed of the best material and the pair had good precedent for the course they were about to take
6145,3807-4923-0048.flac,go with him ye beggars said he and leave us honest men oh you'll get a tying up for this the phrase tying up brought with it recollection of the worst portion of military discipline the cat
6146,3807-4923-0032.flac,come come sir returned the soldier sulkily this ain't the time to bully and as for mutiny why one man's about as good as another just now this speech from the lips of the man who
6147,3807-4923-0058.flac,great god cried bates running up to his knees in water after the departing boats would you leave us here to starve
6148,3807-4923-0031.flac,it's no use mister frere said the man nearest him we can do no good now and they won't hurt us i dare say you dogs you are in league with them burst out frere purple with indignation do you mutiny
6149,3807-4923-0042.flac,poor missus vickers with a woman's quick instinct saw this and even amid her own trouble found leisure to console him the wretches she said under her breath as frere was flung down beside her to subject you to such indignity
6150,3807-4923-0044.flac,and clad in dazzling mail or at the very least as a muscular hero who would settle affairs out of hand by sheer personal prowess if she had entertained any such notion the reality must have struck coldly upon her senses
6151,3807-4923-0007.flac,even if they got safe to port the chances of final escape were all against them for what account could they give of themselves overpowered by these reflections the honest fellow made one last effort to charm his captors back to their pristine bondage
6152,3807-4923-0013.flac,but i have no wish to leave you without clothes bates listened in a sort of dismal admiration at this courtly convict he could not have spoken like that had life depended on it now my little lady continued rex
6153,3807-4923-0040.flac,remembered how easily a twitch of the finger would pay off old scores and was silent step in here sir if you please said rex with polite irony i am sorry to be compelled to tie you but i must consult my own safety as well as your convenience
6154,3807-4923-0021.flac,shouting to them to lay two but frere boiling with rage at the manner in which the tables had been turned on him had determined not to resign his lost authority without a struggle disregarding the summons he came straight on with his eyes fixed on the vessel
6155,3807-4923-0053.flac,rex teering fair russen and the two recruits pulling and the other four standing up with their muskets levelled at the jolly boat their long slavery had begotten such a dread of authority in these men that they feared it even when it was bound and menaced by four muskets
6156,3807-4923-0022.flac,it was now nearly dark and the figures on the deck were indistinguishable the indignant lieutenant could but guess at the condition of affairs suddenly from out of the darkness a voice hailed him hold water back water
6157,3807-4923-0047.flac,dimly caught the meaning of the sentence
6158,3807-4923-0043.flac,sylvia said nothing and seemed to shrink from the lieutenant perhaps in her childish fancy she had pictured him as coming to her rescue
6159,3807-4923-0056.flac,this being done under the muzzles of the muskets rex commanded that bates and frere should push the jolly boat as far as they could from the shore and ryly catching her by a boat hook as she came towards them she was taken in tow
6160,3807-4923-0046.flac,the soldiers paused irresolute to join the mutineers meant a certainty of hard work with a chance of ultimate hanging yet to stay with the prisoners was as far as they could see to incur the inevitable fate of starvation on a barren coast
6161,3807-4923-0025.flac,ran the boat alongside under the very nose of the revengeful rex the mass of iron fell half in board upon the now stayed boat and gave her sternway with a splintered plank villains cried frere would you swamp us
6162,3807-4923-0023.flac,it cried and was then seemingly choked in its owner's throat the voice was the property of mister bates standing near the side he had observed rex and fare bringing up a great pig of iron irst used as a part of the ballast of the brig
6163,3807-4923-0034.flac,he was now no more than anyone else indeed he was less than many for those who held the firearms were the ruling powers with a groan he resided himself to his fate and looking at the sleeve of the undressed uniform he wore
6164,3807-4923-0055.flac,but the clear sky began to thrill with a late moon as yet unrisen and the waves breaking gently upon the beach glimmered with a radiance born of their own motion frere and bates jumping ashore helped out missus vickers sylvia and the wounded grimes
6165,3807-4923-0057.flac,three cheers for old england and liberty upon which a great shout went up echoed by the grim hills which had witnessed so many miseries to the wretched five this exultant mirth sounded like the knell of death
6166,3807-4955-0010.flac,shouted to put the boat about but he might with as much reason have shouted at an avalanche the wind blew his voice away and emptied it violently into the air a snarling billow jerked the oar from his hand
6167,3807-4955-0032.flac,blunt had not chosen men who were likely to betray him though for that matter rex had suggested a precaution which rendered betrayal almost impossible
6168,3807-4955-0027.flac,blunt rubbed his eyes and stared he looked at the man at the helm do you see anything yonder jem jem a sydney man who had never been round that coast before briefly remarked lighthouse
6169,3807-4955-0019.flac,being a strong and vigorous villain however he clung tenaciously to his oar and even unbuckling his leather belt passed it round the slip of wood that was his salvation girding himself to it as firmly as he was able
6170,3807-4955-0017.flac,and passed over his sprawling body to the shore cox grasping at anything to save himself clutched an oar and the next moment found himself borne out with the overturned whale boat by the under tow he was drifted past his only hope of rescue the guard boat
6171,3807-4955-0030.flac,and then said in tones trembling with greed it's a fire lie too and lower away the jolly boat old man that's our bird for a thousand pounds the pretty mary shortened sail and bluntand staples got into the jolly boat
6172,3807-4955-0036.flac,and this isthmus of the guarded neck was hidden by the outlying cliff in the south western angle of this cliff about midway between the summit and the sea was an arch which vomited a red and flickering light that faintly shone upon the sea in the track of the boat
6173,3807-4955-0012.flac,by the recoil of the waves towards them for an instant all thought that they must share the fate which had overtaken the unlucky convicts but burgess succeeded in trimming the boat and awed by the peril he had so narrowly escaped gave the order to return
6174,3807-4955-0016.flac,reached the upper portion of the shore in safety of all this number only cox was lost he was pulling stroke oar and being something of a laggard stood in the way of the crow who seeing the importance of haste and preserving his own skin plucked the man backwards by the collar
6175,3807-4955-0006.flac,saw a wild waste of raging seas scooped into abysmal troughs in which the bulk of a leviathan might wallow at the bottom of one of these valleys of water lay the mutineer's boat looking with its outspread oars like some six legged insect
6176,3807-4955-0023.flac,he further said that it pricked him to breathe cursed jimmy vetch the settlement and the sea and so impenitently died blunt smoked three pipes and then altered the course of the pretty merry two poisond to the eastward and ran for the coast
6177,3807-4955-0003.flac,and setting his teeth as he seized the oar that served as a rudder he put the boat's head straight for the huge rock that formed the northern horn of pirates bay save for the faint phosphorescent radiance of the foaming waves the darkness was intense
6178,3807-4955-0014.flac,and they knew that it was one of the shattered boat's crew clinging to an oar he was the only one of them alive said burgess bandaging his sprained wrist two hours afterwards at the neck and he's food for the fishes by this time he was mistaken however
6179,3807-4955-0013.flac,as the men set the boat's head to the welcome line of lights that marked the neck a black spot balanced upon a black line was swept under their stern and carried out to sea as it passed them this black spot emitted a cry
6180,3807-4955-0002.flac,knew that on the southern point of the promontory was a strip of beach upon which the company might by good fortune land in safety with something of the decision of his leader rex the crow determined at once that in their desperate plight this was the only measure
6181,3807-4955-0007.flac,floating in a pool of ink the great cliff whose every scar and crag was as distinct as though its huge bulk was but a yard distant seemed to shoot out from its base toward the struggling insect a broad flat straw that was a strip of dry land
6182,3807-4955-0008.flac,the next instant the rushing water carrying the six legged atom with it creamed up over this strip of beach
6183,3807-4955-0015.flac,fate had in reserve for the crew of villains a less merciful death than that of drowning aided by the lightning and that wonderful good luck which urges villainy to its destruction vetch beached the boat and the party bruised and bleeding
6184,3807-4955-0038.flac,stooping and rising as though feeding the fire one might have imagined that a door in vulcan' smithy
6185,3807-4955-0011.flac,despite the desperate efforts of the soldiers the boat was whirled up the mountain of water like a leaf on a water spout and a second flash of lightning showed them what seemed a group of dolls struggling in the surf and a walnut shell bottom upwards was driven
6186,3807-4955-0021.flac,lowered a boat and picked him up nearly bisected by the belt gorged with salt water frozen with cold and having two ribs broken the victim of vetch's murderous quickness retained sufficient life to survive blunt's remedies for nearly two hours
6187,3807-4955-0001.flac,that nothing but the desperate nature of the attempt could have justified so desperate a measure the perpendicular cliffs seemed to render such an attempt certain destruction but vetch who had been employed in building the pier at the neck
6188,3807-4955-0005.flac,and apparently about to be flung against the wall of rock which magnified in the flash seemed frightfully near to them the next instant burgess himself whos boat lifted by the swiftly advancing billow
6189,3807-4955-0034.flac,the madems i'll be bound ay she's a knowing one and the sinister laughter of the pair floated across the violet water go easy man said blunt as they neared the shore they're all awake at eagle hawk and if those cursed dogs give tongue
6190,3807-4955-0024.flac,it was possible that the man for whom he was searching had not been retaken and was even now awaiting his arrival it was clearly his duty hearing of the planned escape having been actually attempted not to give up the expedition while hope remained
6191,3807-4955-0035.flac,there'll be a boat out in a twinkling it's lucky the winds off shore staples lay on his oar and listened the night was moonless and the ship had already disappeared from view they were approaching the promontory from the southeast
6192,3807-4955-0022.flac,during that time he stated that his name was cox that he had escaped from port arthur with eight others that john rex was the leader of the expedition that the others were all drowned and that he believed john rex had been retaken having placed blunt in possession of these particulars
6193,3807-4955-0004.flac,and burgess for some minutes pulled almost at random in pursuit the same tremendous flash of lightning which had saved the life of mc nab by causing rex to miss his aim showed to the commandant the whale boat balanced on the summit of an enormous wave
6194,3807-4955-0000.flac,chapter twenty five the flight gabbet guided by the crow had determined to beach the captured boat on the southern point of cape surville it will be seen by those who have followed the description of the topography of colonel arthur's penitentiary
6195,3807-4955-0031.flac,go in a hoysterin sir said one of the crew with a grin as blunt threw a bundle into the stern sheets staples thrust his tongue into his cheek the object of the voyage was now pretty well understood among the carefully picked crew
6196,3807-4955-0026.flac,stood off a little across the mouth of pirates bay he was walking the deck groaning at the folly of the expedition when a strange appearance on the southern horn of the bay made him come to a sudden halt there was a furnace blazing in the bowels of the mountain
6197,3807-4955-0028.flac,blunt stumped into the cabin and got out his charts no lighthouse was laid down there only a mark like an anchor and a note remarkable hole at this point a remarkable hole indeed
6198,3807-4955-0020.flac,in this condition plus a swoon from exhaustion he was described by the helmsman of the pretty mary a few miles from capesurville at daylight next morning
6199,3807-4955-0039.flac,and that the old hero was forging arms for a demigod blunt turned pale it's no mortal he whispered let's go back and what will madam say returned dare devil will staples who would have plunged into mount erebus had he been paid for it
6200,3807-4955-0029.flac,a remarkable lime kiln would have been more to the purpose blunt called up his mate william staples a fellow whom sarah purfoy's gold had bought body and soul william staples looked at the waxing and waning glow for a while
6201,3807-4955-0018.flac,with a velocity that forbade all attempts at rescue and almost before the poor scoundrel had time to realize his condition he was in the best possible way of escaping the hanging that his comrades had so often humorously prophesied for him
6202,3807-4955-0009.flac,appeared to stoop down over the ocean and as it stooped the billow rolled onwards the boat glided down into the depths and the whole phantasmagoria was swallowed up in the tumultuous darkness of the tempest burgess his hair bristling with terror

6206,7859-102519-0031.flac,the boat weathered the storm and justinian survived to carry out his cruel oath he came ashore in the land of the bulgarians and soon won favor with their king terbal who wanted a good excuse for invading the empire
6207,7859-102519-0016.flac,and banished him to cherson theodotus and stephanus he handed over to the mob who dragged them round the city and burnt them alive
6208,7859-102519-0039.flac,and put out the eyes of the patriarch who had crowned him then he set to work to hunt out meaner victims many prominent citizens of constantinople were sewn up in sacks and drowned in the bosphorus soldiers were picked out by the dozen and beheaded

6210,7859-102519-0054.flac,with every expectation of success when at last there appeared the man who was destined to save the east roman empire from a premature dismemberment
6211,7859-102519-0028.flac,and then calling on the second khazar served him in the same fashion before the khan's orders had been divulged to any one this gave him time to escape and he fled in a fishing boat out into the euxine with a few friends and servants who had followed him into exile
6212,7859-102519-0032.flac,and found it in the pretence of supporting the exiled monarch with a bulgarian army at his back justinian appeared before constantinople
6213,7859-102519-0019.flac,where the romans had still maintained themselves by hard fighting

6220,7859-102519-0013.flac,and bade him save himself by a bold stroke if he would aim a blow at justinian he would find the people and the army ready to follow him
6221,7859-102519-0052.flac,with the express purpose of laying siege to constantinople no one hindered him for the army raised to serve against him

6238,7859-102519-0011.flac,he began to execute or imprison his officers and to decimate his beaten troops to be employed by him in high command was almost as dangerous as it was to be appointed a general in chief during the dictatorship of robesbier
6239,7859-102519-0010.flac,while the emperor's financial expedients were making him hated by the moneyed classes he was rendering himself no less unpopular in the army

6241,7859-102519-0041.flac,these atrocities were mere samples of the general conduct of justinian in a few years he had made himself so much detested that it might be said that he had been comparatively popular in the days of his first reign
6242,7859-102519-0030.flac,may god drown me here he answered

6246,7859-102519-0048.flac,philippicus was blinded and compelled to exchange the pleasures of the palace for the rigours of the monastery but the court intrigue which dethroned philippicus did not please the army
6247,7859-102519-0035.flac,and should have resisted him at all hazards justinian came back in a relentless mood bent on nothing but revenging his mutilated nose and his ten years of exile his first act was to send for the two usurpers who had sat on his throne
6248,7859-102519-0038.flac,and apsimarus after this strange exhibition the two ex emperors were beheaded their execution began a reign of terror for justinian had his oath to keep and was set on reeking vengeance on everyone who had been concerned in his deposition
6249,7859-102519-0042.flac,the army of the tyrant laid down their arms when philippicus approached and he was led forth and beheaded without further delay an end too good for such a monster the conqueror also sought out and slew his little son tiberius

6259,7859-102519-0006.flac,justinian's wars depleded his treasury yet he persisted in plunging into expensive schemes of building at the same time and was driven to collect money by the most reckless extortion he employed two unscrupulous ministers theodotus

6308,7859-102521-0009.flac,these unwise measures had the natural effect the monks were everywhere regarded as martyrs and the image worship which they supported grew more than ever popular with the masses while still in the full vigor of his persecuting enthusiasm

6328,2836-5355-0053.flac,alas it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her this last child the ill faded little being in the cradle beside her
6329,2836-5355-0037.flac,remember though that it is your doing not mine but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel a sum we will fix upon the amount amicably
6330,2836-5355-0026.flac,as she turned her indignant eyes toward him sir francis laughed all stratagems are fair in love and war she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb
6331,2836-5355-0023.flac,and the calmer he spoke the more cutting were his words he need not have told her this what was the secret she inquired in a low tone nay i can't explain all they did not take me into their confidence they did not even take you
6332,2836-5355-0004.flac,your words are not words of truth but of deceit you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage
6333,2836-5355-0033.flac,which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writing case from it gave it to her she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow unlocked the case and took from it some bank notes
6334,2836-5355-0036.flac,if it be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so he said i must confess i think it may be the wisest course as things have come to this pass for a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable
6335,2836-5355-0044.flac,he took out his pocket book and placed the bank notes within it your clothes
6336,2836-5355-0032.flac,these apartments are mine now they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation will you be so obliging i am not strong as to hand me that writing case sir francis walked to the table she indicated
6337,2836-5355-0017.flac,you ladies should think of that beforehand yes she sadly answered may heaven help all to do so who may be tempted as i was if you mean that as a reproach to me it's rather out of place chafed sir francis
6338,2836-5355-0035.flac,allow me to return them to you count them return them to me for what inquired sir francis in amazement i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long take them
6339,2836-5355-0048.flac,then he paid a visit to the landlord and handed him likewise a year's rent in advance making the same remark after that he ordered dinner at a hotel and the same night he and pierre departed on their journey home again
6340,2836-5355-0006.flac,i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning of your departure it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced she spoke so quietly so apparently without feeling or passion that sir francis was agreeably astonished
6341,2836-5355-0011.flac,when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the child's inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed
6342,2836-5355-0051.flac,but that she seemed never to have gone away from it walking in the flower garden with mister carlyle while the three children played on the lawn her arm was within her husband's and he was relating something to her what the news was she could not remember afterward
6343,2836-5355-0049.flac,sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks
6344,2836-5355-0024.flac,and carlyle was acting in it under the rose for missus hale she could not seek out carlyle herself so she sent the young lady that's all i know how did you know it i had reason to think so
6345,2836-5355-0029.flac,who is he like isabel my handsome self were he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided
6346,2836-5355-0019.flac,quite true was her reply and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabel if it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse it is of no consequence to smooth over facts
6347,2836-5355-0041.flac,whom do you take me for what do you take me for she repeated rising in her bitter mortification if you have put me beyond the pal of the world i am still lord mount severn's daughter you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as
6348,2836-5355-0050.flac,into an adjoining room when lady isabel lay down to rest she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep than she had known of late also into a dream she thought she was back at east lyne not back in one sense
6349,2836-5355-0034.flac,i received these from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so
6350,2836-5355-0047.flac,and calling the servants before him there were but two gave them each a year's wages in advance
6351,2836-5355-0042.flac,don't i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it
6352,2836-5355-0046.flac,i wish you a good day so you will not even shake hands with me isabel i would prefer not and thus they parted sir francis left the room but not immediately the house he went into a distant apartment
6353,2836-5355-0018.flac,whose fits of ill temper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger towards your husband
6354,2836-5355-0010.flac,well isabel you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks but her voice sounded calm as before
6355,2836-5355-0003.flac,then i found myself overwhelmed with business and away from it i could not get even now i can only remain with you a couple of days for i must hasten back to town you are breaking faith already she said after hearing him calmly to the end
6356,2836-5355-0012.flac,and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed he did not take the trouble to look at it i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy he resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words
6357,2836-5355-0002.flac,when you left in july you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage you know what i mean when i say in time but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise he interrupted but no sooner had i set my foot in london
6358,2836-5355-0022.flac,her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the interview he spoke quietly now quite in an equal tone of reasoning it was his way when the ill temper was upon him
6359,2836-5355-0030.flac,outwardly into calmness again what else reported sir francis you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me
6360,2836-5355-0009.flac,would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it you deem that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time
6361,2836-5355-0015.flac,if you have taken this aversion to me it cannot be helped he coldly said inwardly congratulating himself let us not doubt at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation
6362,2836-5355-0021.flac,and i say i think you are on the wrong scent i do not believe mister carlyle ever thought of the girl in that way what do you mean she gasped they had a secret between them not of love a secret of business and those interviews they had together
6363,2836-5355-0020.flac,i do not understand what you would imply she said drawing her shawl around her with a fresh shiver how on the wrong scent with regard to your husband and that haire girl you were blindly outrageously jealous of him go on
6364,2836-5355-0028.flac,was her icy answer let's see how old is he now he was born on the last day of august sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes
6365,2836-5355-0016.flac,she shook her head all the reparation in your power to make all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin it and the effects must lie upon me forever oh sin was the derisive exclamation
6366,2836-5355-0000.flac,settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction to speak and act let there be plain truth between us at this interview if there never has been before i don't understand you naked truth unglossed over
6367,2836-5355-0007.flac,he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask but he was an ill tempered man and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now lady isabel continued
6368,2836-5355-0013.flac,and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay interrupted lady isabel you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife were you to propose to do so this day
6369,2836-5355-0001.flac,she pursued bending her eyes determinately upon him it must be with all my heart rejoined sir francis it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind
6370,2836-5354-0031.flac,you may drop that odious title isabel which has stuck to me too long i own a better now what one pray you can look and see lady isabel took up the letter and read it sir francis swallowed down his coffee and rang the
6371,2836-5354-0029.flac,on your favouring us with instructions and we remain sir most faithfully yours moss and grab sir francis levison barte the outside of the letter was superscribed as the other f levison esquire
6372,2836-5354-0011.flac,it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings and she knew that her whole future existence whether spent with that man or without him would be a dark course of gnawing retribution nearly a year went by save some six or eight weeks
6373,2836-5354-0042.flac,scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and the tray when sir francis levison appeared equipped for traveling good bye isabel said he without further circumlocution or ceremony
6374,2836-5354-0022.flac,last out a whole ten months you are in agregious error compliments the very opposite to honey and sweetness have generally supervened long before try it if you don't believe me two letters she continued
6375,2836-5354-0001.flac,taking one absence with the other he had been away from her chiefly in paris pursuing his own course and his own pleasure how fared it with lady isabel just as it must be expected to fare and does fare
6376,2836-5354-0014.flac,misery marks the countenance worse than sickness her face was white and worn her hands were thin her eyes were sunken and surrounded by a black circle care was digging caves for them
6377,2836-5354-0053.flac,the girl departed closing the door and lady isabel sat looking at it schooling her patience another moment and it was flung open sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in she waved him off begging him
6378,2836-5354-0047.flac,and white and sleedy and sloppy the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets were unusually black and the people crept along especially dismal close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom
6379,2836-5354-0004.flac,she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror from which there was never more any escape never more never more the very instant the very night of her departure she awoke to what she had done the guilt
6380,2836-5354-0041.flac,where is pierre miladi asked
6381,2836-5354-0006.flac,lady wife mother should you ever be tempted to abandon your home so will you awake whatever trials may be the lot of your married life though they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature
6382,2836-5354-0038.flac,nothing can repair the injury if you once suffer it to come upon him he will be a byword amidst men throughout his life you had better have written to the law lords to urge on the divorce he returned i cannot help the delay
6383,2836-5354-0003.flac,when instead of the garden of roses it had been her persuader's pleasure to promise her she would fall into but which in truth she had barely glanced at for that had not been her moving motive
6384,2836-5354-0000.flac,nearly a year went by lady isabel carlyle had spent it on the continent that refuge for such fugitives now moving about from place to place with her companion now stationary and alone quite half the time
6385,2836-5354-0012.flac,furnished in the vicinity of the place grenette a windy old house it was full of doors and windows chimneys and cupboards and he said he should remain there lady isabel remonstrated
6386,2836-5354-0046.flac,you will wait i cannot wait he replied his tone changing to one of determination it is useless to urge it he broke from her and left the room and in another minute had left the house pierre attending him a feeling amounting to a conviction
6387,2836-5354-0007.flac,the endurance of woman to bear resolve to bear them fall down upon your knees and pray to be enabled to bear them pray for patience pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape bear unti death
6388,2836-5354-0045.flac,you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us the instant news of the divorce shall arrive
6389,2836-5354-0013.flac,she wished to go farther on where they might get quicker news from england but her will now was as nothing she was looking like the ghost of her former self talk of her having looked ill when she took the voyage over the water with mister carlyle you should have seen her now
6390,2836-5354-0008.flac,rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience for be assured that the alternative if you do rush on to it will be found worse than death poor thing poor lady isabel she had sacrificed husband children
6391,2836-5354-0032.flac,table handbell the only bell you generally meet with in france pierre answered it put me up a change of things said he in french i start for england in an hour it is very well pierre responded and departed to do it
6392,2836-5354-0019.flac,in seeking a divorce and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected she was anxious for it anxious that captain levison should render her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child
6393,2836-5354-0020.flac,little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation any more than he had made it to others who had gone before her she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself
6394,2836-5354-0030.flac,at last thank the pigs was the gentleman's euphonious expression as he tossed the letter open on the breakfast table the divorce is granted feverishly uttered lady isabel he made no reply but seated himself to breakfast
6395,2836-5354-0033.flac,lady isabel waited till the man was gone and then spoke a faint flush of emotion in her cheeks you do not mean what you say you will not leave me yet i cannot do otherwise he answered there's a mountain of business to be attended to
6396,2836-5354-0015.flac,a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health she knew better knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart it was very late for breakfast but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day
6397,2836-5354-0039.flac,there has been no delay quite the contrary but it may be expected hourly now you are worrying yourself for nothing isabel i shall be back in time he quitted the room as he spoke and lady isabel remained in it the image of despair
6398,2836-5354-0035.flac,you might not be back in time in time for what oh how can you ask she rejoined in a sharp tone of reproach you know too well in time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear i shall chance it
6399,2836-5354-0027.flac,sir after sending off our last dated to day we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison your grand uncle he expired this afternoon in town where he had come for the benefit of medical advice
6400,2836-5354-0016.flac,languidly she took her seat at the table just as captain levison's servant a frenchman whom he had engaged in paris entered the room with two letters pointe de gazette pierre
6401,2836-5354-0023.flac,and they are both in the same handwriting your solicitors i believe up went his hand at the last word and he made a sort of grab at the letters stalked to the farthest window opened it and glanced over its contents sir
6402,2836-5354-0037.flac,now don't put yourself in a fever isabel how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you it does no good is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england have you no pity for your child she urged in agitation
6403,2836-5354-0017.flac,and all the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket but he was only obeying the orders of his master it had been captain levison's recent pleasure that the newspapers should not be seen by lady isabel until he had overlooked them
6404,2836-5354-0051.flac,that milady would soon get about if she would only rouse herself she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it
6405,2836-5354-0021.flac,the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest slavens in domestic privacy he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy and she as apathetically answered to it pierre says there are some letters he began
6406,2836-5354-0034.flac,besides i should not choose for the old man's funeral to take place without me
6407,2836-5354-0028.flac,we have much pleasure in congratulating you upon your accession to the title and estates and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you
6408,2836-5354-0049.flac,and she shook and shivered perpetually though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and the crackling logs
6409,2836-5354-0050.flac,she had had a long illness terminating in a low fever
6410,2836-5354-0054.flac,in a subdued quiet tone not to draw too near as any little excitement made her faint now he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot as he explained that he really could not get away from town before
6411,2836-5354-0036.flac,coolly observed sir francis chance it chance the legitimacy of the child you must assure that before all things
6412,2836-5354-0040.flac,nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed
6413,2836-5354-0005.flac,whose aspect had been shunned in the perspective assumed at once its true frightful color the blackness of darkness and a lively remorse a never dying anguish took possession of her soul forever oh reader believe me
6414,2836-5354-0052.flac,had he come who is it she asked of the nurse milady it is monsieur and pierre is with him i have begged milady often and often not to fret for monsieur would surely come milady see i am right
6415,2836-5354-0009.flac,reputation home all that makes life of value to woman she had forfeited her duty to god and deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison
6416,2836-5354-0048.flac,full of windows and doors and draughts with its wide hearth and its wide chimney into which we could put four or five of our english ones shivered lady isabel vane she had an invalid cap on and a thick woollen invalid shawl
6417,2836-5354-0026.flac,news of the divorce i mean tush was the response of captain levison as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a far off affair
6418,2836-5354-0044.flac,how can you be so alarmed isabel of course i have he continued in a peevish though kind tone as he took hold of her hands to raise her no not yet i will remain here until you say you will wait another day or two
6419,2836-5354-0025.flac,it was over then and all claim to the name of carlyle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabel forever captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket is there any news she asked
6420,2836-5354-0010.flac,but the instant the step was irrevocable the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance set in even in the first days of her departure in the fleeting moments of abandonment when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience
6421,2836-5354-0024.flac,we beg to inform you that the suit carlyle versus carlyle is at an end the divorce was pronounced without opposition according to your request we hasten to forward you the earliest intimation of the fact we are sir faithfully yours moss and grab
6422,2836-5354-0043.flac,lady isabel excited beyond all self control slipped the bolt to the door and half leaning against it half leaning at his feet held up her hand in supplication francis have you any consideration left for me any in the world
6423,2836-5354-0002.flac,when a high principled gentlewoman falls from her pedestal never had she experienced a moment's calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion
6424,2836-5354-0018.flac,you will speedily gather his motive pierre departed through captain levison's room and lady isabel took up the letters and examined their superscription with interest it was known to her that mister carlyle had not lost a moment
6425,625-132112-0015.flac,i says look up if you don't look up you can't get up remarked jackson philosophically and he's gotten up dark carter's neat barns would do credit to new england his master helped him to get a start
6426,625-132112-0013.flac,the planters are in debt to the merchants the tenants owe the planters and laborers bow and bend beneath the burden of it all here and there a man has raised his head above these murky waters
6427,625-132112-0052.flac,we passed the muns in place where a plucky white widow is renting and struggling and the eleven hundred acres of the senate plantation with its negro overseer
6428,625-132112-0018.flac,so he moved here where the rent is higher the land poorer and the owner inflexible he rents a forty dollar mule for twenty dollars a year poor lad a slave at twenty two this plantation owned now by a foreigner
6429,625-132112-0024.flac,twenty years yonder sunken cheeked old black man has laboured under that system and now turned day labourer is supporting his wife and borting himself on his wages of a dollar and a half a week received only part of the year
6430,625-132112-0049.flac,for pa willis was the tall and powerful black moses who led the negroes for a generation and led them well he was a baptist preacher and when he died two thousand black people followed him to the grave and now they preach his funeral sermon each year
6431,625-132112-0039.flac,that the concern soon landed in inextricable bankruptcy nobody lives in the old house now but a man comes each winter out of the north and collects his high rents i know not which are the more touching such old empty houses
6432,625-132112-0014.flac,we passed one fenced stock farm with grass and grazing cattle that looked very homelike after endless corn and cotton here and there are black freeholders there is the gaunt dull black jackson with his hundred acres
6433,625-132112-0023.flac,should bind her own to sloth and misfortune as ruthlessly as ever england did the poor land groans with its birth pains and brings forth scarcely a hundred pounds of cotton to the acre where fifty years ago
6434,625-132112-0045.flac,then too there are fewer signs of a romantic past and more of systematic modern land grabbing and money getting white people are more inevidence here
6435,625-132112-0040.flac,or the homes of the masters sons sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those white doors tales of poverty of struggle of disappointment a revolution such as that of sixty three is a terrible thing
6436,625-132112-0056.flac,it was one of those scenes one cannot soon forget a wide low little house whose motherly roof reached over and sheltered a snug little porch there we sat after the long hot drive drinking cool water
6437,625-132112-0010.flac,we see on all sides within the circle of dark forest a land of canaan here and there are tales of projects for money getting borne in the swift days of reconstruction
6438,625-132112-0034.flac,here and there we meet distinct characters quite out of the ordinary one came out of a piece of newly cleared ground making a wide detour to avoid the snakes he was an old hollow cheeked man with a drawn
6439,625-132112-0031.flac,and we passed on now seers
6440,625-132112-0005.flac,five miles below here is a town owned and controlled by one white new englander he owns almost a rhode island county with thousands of acres and hundreds of black laborers
6441,625-132112-0048.flac,but the owner will not sell off a few acres two children a boy and a girl are hoeing sturdily in the fields on the farm where corless works he is smooth faced and brown and is fencing up his pigs
6442,625-132112-0043.flac,but the window panes were gone the pillars were worm eaten and the moss grown roof was falling in half curiously i peered through the unhinged door and saw where on the wall across the hall
6443,625-132112-0016.flac,but when the black man died last fall the master's sons immediately laid claim to the estate and them white folks will get it too says my yellow gossip i turn from these well tended acres with a comfortable feeling that the negro is rising
6444,625-132112-0028.flac,and still having nothing to be sure he had given four children a common school training and perhaps if the new fence law had not allowed unfenced crops in west dougherty he might have raised a little stock and kept ahead
6445,625-132112-0012.flac,the solemn pines have disappeared and this is the oakee woods with its wealth of hickories beeches oaks and palmettos but a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful land the merchants are in debt to the wholesailers
6446,625-132112-0021.flac,but not until one of the fairest regions of the okee woods had been ruined and ravished into a red waste out of which only a yankee or an immigrant could squeeze more blood from debt cursed tenants no wonder that luke black
6447,625-132112-0047.flac,the returns of the farmer are too small to allow much for wages and yet he will not sell off small farms there is the negro sandford he has worked fourteen years as overseer on the ladson place and

6583,7278-104730-0010.flac,was after all of trifling consequence to him and of no serious influence upon the course of history the old new england instincts was in him as it was in the mass of the people that instinct made him the real exponent of new england thought
6584,7278-104730-0018.flac,that whereas the agitation of the subject was disquieting and objectionable all petitions
6585,7278-104730-0041.flac,order notwithstanding the speaker then said the gentleman from massachusetts will take his seat
6586,7278-104730-0026.flac,as then made up the house of representatives were hardly even upon the iron temper an inflexible disposition of mister adams the most insignificant error of conduct in me at this time he writes in april
6587,7278-104730-0038.flac,february fourteenth in the same year was a field day in the petition campaign he presented them no less than three hundred and fifty petitions all but three or four of which bore more or less
6588,7278-104730-0022.flac,that it was not in order might be entered on the journal
6589,7278-104730-0020.flac,mister adams had a support among the people at large vastly greater than he could have enjoyed as the opponent of slavery as his adversaries had shaped the issue he was predestined to victory in a free country
6590,7278-104730-0017.flac,one that congress had no power to interfere with slavery in any state two that congress ought not to interfere with slavery in the district of columbia
6591,7278-104730-0001.flac,was to present fifteen petitions signed numerously by citizens of pennsylvania praying for the abolition of slavery and the slave trade in the district of columbia he simply moved their reference to the committee on the district of columbia
6592,7278-104730-0013.flac,mister adams again presented two petitions for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia but without giving rise to much excitement the
6593,7278-104730-0030.flac,i have gone he said as far upon this article the abolition of slavery as the public opinion of the free portion of the union will bear
6594,7278-104730-0021.flac,having constituted a vote mister adams called attention to the omission the clerk by direction of the speaker thereupon called his name
6595,7278-104730-0031.flac,and so far that scarcely a slave holding member of the house dares to vote with me upon any question i have as yet been thoroughly sustained by my own state but one step further and i hazard my own standing and influenced there
6596,7278-104730-0032.flac,my own final overthrow and the cause of liberty itself for an indefinite time certainly for more than my remain of life were there in the house one member capable of taking the lead in this cause of universal emancipation
6597,7278-104730-0042.flac,and presented another petition he did not dare tell me
6598,7278-104730-0037.flac,all laid on the table january fifteenth he presented fifty more january twenty eighth he received thirty one petitions and spent that day and the next in assorting and filing these and others which he previously had amounting in all to one hundred and twenty
6599,7278-104730-0011.flac,when his fellow representatives almost to a man deserted him he was sustained by many a token of sympathy and admiration coming from among the people at large
6600,7278-104730-0006.flac,to encounter the mighty efforts which were made to stiffle the great humanitarian cry in the halls of the national legislature this was quite as much as one man was equal to
6601,7278-104730-0036.flac,in december eighteen thirty seven still at this same work he made a hard but fruitless effort
6602,7278-104730-0040.flac,i waited till it subscided and then resumed that if they could catch him they would hang him i said this so as to be distinctly heard throughout the hall the renewed
6603,7278-104730-0033.flac,which is moving onward in the world and in this country i would withdraw from the contest which will rage with increasing fury as it draws to its crisis but for the management of which my age infirmities and approaching end
6604,7278-104730-0028.flac,the extremests who had cast aside all regard for what was practicable and who utterly scorned to consider the feasibility or the consequences of measures
6605,7278-104730-0005.flac,outside the walls of congress the business of firing the people and stirring popular opinion and sympathy he was set to do that portion of the work of abolition which was to be done in congress
6606,7278-104730-0003.flac,multiplying for the purpose of spreading and increasing a popular hostility towards the great
6607,7278-104730-0027.flac,eighteen thirty seven would be my irredeemable ruin in this world and both the ruling political parties are watching with intense anxiety for some overt act by me to set the whole pack of their harling presses upon me
6608,7278-104730-0029.flac,urging him to action which would only have destroyed him further in political life would have stripped him of his influence exiled him from the position in congress where he could render the most efficient service that was in him
6609,7278-104730-0016.flac,declaring that the house would not entertain any petitions for the abolition
6610,7278-104730-0000.flac,were before him it was a part of his destiny to become the champion of the anti slavery cause in the national legislature
6611,7278-104730-0015.flac,but in a moment mister glascock of georgia moved that the petition be not received debate sprang up on a point of order and two days later before the question of reception was determined a resolution was offered by mister jarvis of maine
6612,7278-104730-0009.flac,having a natural distaste for disquieting agitation and influenced by class feeling the gentlemen of the north sympathizing with the aristocracy of the south could not make common cause with anti slavery people fortunately
6613,7278-104730-0034.flac,totally disqualify me there is no such man in the house september fifteenth eighteen thirty seven he says i have been for some time occupied day and night
6614,7278-104730-0035.flac,no return to my request from the servile side of the house the next day he presented fifty one more like documents and notes having previously presented one hundred and fifty more
6615,7278-104730-0012.flac,quite in the wrong and predestined to well merited defeat
6616,7278-104730-0023.flac,he brought up the matter again one of his opponents made a false step and mister adams bantered him upon it until the other was provoked into saying that if the question ever came to the issue of war the southern people
6617,7278-104730-0002.flac,that he had always cherished an abhorrence of slavery and a bitter antipathy to slave holders as a class is sufficiently indicated by many chance remarks scattered
6618,7278-104730-0039.flac,i said that in another part of the capital it had been threatened that if a northern abolitionists should go to north carolina and utter a principle of the declaration of independence here a loud cry of order order burst forth in which the speaker yelled the loudest
6619,7278-104730-0007.flac,overawe him nor loneliness dispired him he was probably the most formidable fighter in debate of whom parliamentary records preserve the memory
6620,7278-246956-0003.flac,of the advantages he took for he knew that he had known them such as shrunk from the light not coming
6621,7278-246956-0030.flac,postolic carefulness have protected him i suspect it would only have given rise to more vulgar misunderstandings and misrepresentations still to explain to him who loves not is but to give him the more
6622,7278-246956-0026.flac,in order thereby to attain to a better innocence then without it could ever be theirs how far she mistook or how far she knew or suspected that she spoke falsely i will not pretend to know but although she spoke as she did
6623,7278-246956-0029.flac,occasion to the dishonest to caval and condemn imagine saint paul having a prevision of how he would be misunderstood in heeding it what would then have become of all those his most magnificent outbursts and would any amount of
6624,7278-246956-0027.flac,there was something either in the curate or in the sermon that had quieted her a little and she was less contemptuous in her condemnation of him than usual happy both for himself and others the curate
6625,7278-246956-0019.flac,from the couch she took no notice that he had got up and dressed while she was at church and he knew that a cloud had come between them and that after all she had borne and done for him he and his sister were now farther apart
6626,7278-246956-0020.flac,for the time at least than when oceans lay betwixt their birth and their meeting and he found himself looking back with vague longing even to the terrible old house of glaston
6627,7278-246956-0001.flac,mister dre's head was down as i have always said certain things he had been taught in his youth and had practised in his manhood certain mean ways counted honest enough in the trade had become to him
6628,7278-246956-0034.flac,the groom took his horse in the street and he came into the drawing room helen hastened to meet him will george she said anxiously oh it's all right will be at least i am sure
6629,7278-246956-0035.flac,i will tell you all about it in the garden after dinner aunt has the good sense never to interrupt us there he added i'll just run and show myself to leopold he must not suspect that i am of your party and
6630,7278-246956-0008.flac,than all the rest leopold was ever present to him and while he strove to avoid absorption in a personal interest however justifiable it was of necessity
6631,7278-246956-0009.flac,of his utterance at times indeed he felt as if he were speaking to him immediately and to him only at others although then he saw her no more than him
6632,7278-246956-0011.flac,and the firm mouth had forgotten itself into a tremulous form which the stillness of absorption had there for the moment fixed but even already although he could not yet read it upon her
6633,7278-246956-0033.flac,that after an early breakfast he had mounted helen's mare and set out to call on mister hooker
6634,7278-246956-0028.flac,was not one of those who cripple the truth and blind their own souls
6635,7278-246956-0017.flac,she was a free woman and as leopold had chosen other counsellors had thus declared her unworthy of confidence and after all that she had suffered and done for love of him
6636,7278-246956-0024.flac,that they would but strengthen him in his determination to do whatever the teacher of them might approve as she repassed him to go to the drawing room she did indeed say a word of kindness but it was in a forced tone
6637,7278-246956-0022.flac,had been filled with wave upon wave of wishing that poldie could hear this could hear that could have such a thought to comfort him such a lovely word to drive the horror from his soul
6638,7278-246956-0013.flac,when the world was without form and void and the snake said why then did he not speak like that to my leopold why did he not comfort him with such a good hope
6639,7278-246956-0005.flac,from them by the indwelling presence of the god of all living men and true merchants was a blessedness unspeakable small was the suspicion in the abbey church of oliston that morning
6640,7278-246956-0007.flac,with wills that might become free as his own while wingfold had been speaking in general terms with the race in his minds and the congregation in his body's eye he had yet thought more of one soul with its one crime and its intolerable burden
6641,7278-246956-0002.flac,regarded from the ideal point of the divine in
6642,7278-246956-0021.flac,and the sharing of their agony therein his eyes followed her as she walked across to the dressing room and the tears rose and filled them but he said nothing and the sister who all the time of the sermon
6643,7278-246956-0023.flac,now cast on him a chilly glance and said never a word of the things to which she had listened with such heavings of the spirit ocean for she felt with an instinct more righteous than her will
6644,7278-246956-0018.flac,had she not done enough would even her father require more of her than she had already done and endured
6645,7278-246956-0010.flac,that he was comforting the sister individually in holding out to her brother the mighty hope of a restored purity and when once more his mind could receive the messages
6646,7278-246956-0006.flac,battery of sin sprung suffering withstanding and enduring and stilling the recoil of the awful force wherewith his father had launched the worlds and give birth to human souls
6647,7278-246956-0012.flac,countenance a snake had begun to lift its head from the chaotic swamp which runs a creek at least into every soul the rudimentary dissolation a remnant of the time
6648,7278-246956-0000.flac,after the sermon as the sermon drew to a close and the mist of his emotion began to disperse individual faces of his audience again dawned out on the preacher's kin
6649,7278-246956-0004.flac,he was now doing his best to banish them from his business and yet they were a painful presence to his spirit so grievous to be borne
6650,7278-246956-0016.flac,a gray wintery mist had settled down upon her spirit and she said to herself that if this last hope in george should fail her she would not allow the matter to trouble her any further
6651,7278-246956-0031.flac,plentiful material for misinterpretation let a man have truth in the inward parts and out of the abundance of his heart let his mouth speak if then he should have ground to fear honest misunderstanding
6652,7278-246956-0014.flac,well becoming a priest of the gentle jesus or if he fancied he must speak of confession why did he not speak of it in plain honest terms instead of suggesting the idea of it so that the poor boy
6653,7278-246956-0015.flac,imagined it came from his own spirit and must therefore be obeyed as the will of god so said the snake and by the time helen had walked home with her aunt the glow had sunk from her soul and
6654,7278-246956-0032.flac,let him preach again to enforce the truth for which he is jealous and if it should seem to any that the two utterances need reconciling let those who would have them consistent reconcile them for themselves
6655,7278-246956-0025.flac,and was only about his dinner his eyes overflowed but he shut his lips so tight that his mouth grew grim with determination and no more tears came to the friend who joined her at the church door and in george
6656,1594-135914-0021.flac,you know the natural goodness of my disposition and that i love to do justice by these words
6657,1594-135914-0074.flac,and she felt a sudden emotion for which she could not account show me said she to the syndic into the sick man's room i should be glad to see him the syndic conducted her and whilst she was going thither
6658,1594-135914-0106.flac,and there is no question but that he will load your family with favours
6659,1594-135914-0007.flac,but they hoped because they wished it their affection for him increasing instead of diminishing with their misfortunes their conversation was generally about him and they inquired for him of all they met but let us leave jalib al koloob and her mother
6660,1594-135914-0024.flac,i must own that from the first moment he saw me he perhaps designed to devote himself to me and conceived hopes of engaging me to admit his love i guess at this by the eagerness which he showed in entertaining me
6661,1594-135914-0064.flac,and doubt not he will do you as much good as he has done you injury you are no longer his enemies he waits for ganem to requite the service he has done me by uniting our fortunes he gives me to him for his consort
6662,1594-135914-0029.flac,he perceived it but far from availing himself of my frailty and notwithstanding the flame which consumed him he still remained steady in his duty and all that his passion could force from him were the words i have already repeated to your majesty
6663,1594-135914-0075.flac,whose eyes were closed his countenance pale disfigured and bathed in tears she gazed earnestly on him her heart beat and she fancied she beheld ganem but yet she would not believe her eyes
6664,1594-135914-0092.flac,and she satisfied his inquiries saying so many things in commendation of ganem's mother and sister he desired to see them as well as the young merchant though haroon alrusheed was passionate and in his heat sometimes guilty of cruel actions
6665,1594-135914-0077.flac,ganem said she with a trembling voice is it you i behold having spoken these words she stopped to give the young man time to answer but observing that he seemed insensible alas ganem added she
6666,1594-135914-0056.flac,said to ganem's mother be so kind as to tell us your misfortunes and recount your story you cannot make the relation to any persons better disposed to use all possible means to comfort you
6667,1594-135914-0042.flac,the next day she took another purse of the same value and in like equepageas the day before went to the square of the jeweller's shops and stopping at the gateway without alighting sent one of her black eunuchs for the syndic or chief of them
6668,1594-135914-0115.flac,the syndic who was a man of a good taste chose such as were very handsome and had them made up with all expedition they were finished in three days and ganem finding himself strong enough prepared to go abroad
6669,1594-135914-0019.flac,she prostrated herself before him and so continued her face bathed in tears
6670,1594-135914-0096.flac,who told her that ganem had rested well that night and that his disorder proceeding altogether from melancholy the cause being removed he would soon recover his health
6671,1594-135914-0102.flac,he has doubtless listened to you you have dispelledless jealousy and he has restored you to his favour yes my dear ganem answered fetnah i have cleared myself before the commander of the true believers who to make amends for the wrong he has done you
6672,1594-135914-0095.flac,go back to that young merchant and as soon as he has recovered his health you shall bring him to me with his mother and sister the next morning early fetnah repaired to the syndic of the jewellers being impatient to hear of ganem's health and tell the mother and daughter the good news she had for them
6673,1594-135914-0119.flac,which he managed very gracefully the mother and daughter were mounted on mules belonging to the palace and whilst fetnah on another mule led them by a by way to the prince's court jaafir conducted ganem and brought him into the hall of audience
6674,1594-135914-0053.flac,madam answered the syndic's wife they lie in those beds you see by each other
6675,1594-135914-0084.flac,in favour of whom the commander of the true believers has caused a proclamation to be made in bagdad declaring that he forgives him what is past be satisfied for the present with knowing so much
6676,1594-135914-0083.flac,but you shall see her again as soon as you are in a condition to bear the interview you now stand in need of rest and nothing ought to obstruct your taking it the situation of your affairs is altered since you are as i suppose that ganem
6677,1594-135914-0118.flac,ganem returned no other answer to the vizier's compliment than by profoundly bowing his head
6678,1594-135914-0017.flac,he was overjoyed at the thought for he respected fetnah and had been much concerned at her disgrace therefore flying instantly to the tower madam said he to the favourite with such an air as expressed his satisfaction be pleased to follow me
6679,1594-135914-0108.flac,he appeared so impatient to see them that the favourite could no longer defer giving him the satisfaction and accordingly called them in they were at the door waiting for that moment they entered went up to ganem and embracing him in their turns
6680,1594-135914-0100.flac,you have again found your fetnah whom you thought you had lost forever
6681,1594-135914-0088.flac,fetnah then said let us bless heaven for having brought us al together
6682,1594-135914-0103.flac,beautiful fetnah may i give credit to what you tell me
6683,1594-135914-0105.flac,who before caused search to be made for you to take away your life and who in his fury caused your mother and your sister to suffer a thousand indignities desires now to see you that he may reward the respect you had for him
6684,1594-135914-0087.flac,there was no occasion for the syndic's saying any more to ganem's mother as soon as she was told that she could not converse with her son without hazarding his life she ceased insisting to go and see him
6685,1594-135914-0116.flac,while he was making ready with his mother and sister the grand vizier jafir came to the syndic's house he had come on horseback attended by a great number of officers sir said he to ganem as soon as he entered
6686,1594-135914-0070.flac,he was bound with cords on a camel because he had not strength enough to sit they had already unbound him and were carrying him into the hospital when i happened to pass by i went up to the young man viewed him attentively
6687,1594-135914-0046.flac,and will be pleased to step to my house
6688,1594-135914-0047.flac,i met them yesterday as they were coming into the city they were in a deplorable condition and it moved me the more because i thought they were persons of rank through all the rags that covered them notwithstanding the impression the sun has made on their faces
6689,1594-135914-0110.flac,when they had dried up their tears ganem drew them afresh by the recital of what he had suffered from the day he left fetnah till the moment the syndic brought him to his house he told them that having taken refuge in a small village he there fell sick
6690,1594-135914-0098.flac,because there was ground to fear that not knowing his mother and sister were at bagdad the sight of them might occasion too great a surprise and joy it was therefore resolved that fetnah should first go alone into ganem's chamber
6691,1594-135914-0123.flac,and assigned him a considerable pension he then descended from his throne and causing only ganem and the grand vizier follow him retired into his own apartment
6692,1594-135914-0020.flac,i think you charge me with violence and injustice who is he that notwithstanding the regard and respect he had for me is in a miserable condition speak freely
6693,1594-135914-0076.flac,though she found something of ganem in the objects she beheld yet in other respects he appeared so different that she durst not imagine it was he that lay before her unable however to withstand the earnest desire of being satisfied
6694,1594-135914-0068.flac,but why should we despair of seeing him again we shall find him the happiness of meeting with you makes me conceive fresh hopes perhaps this is the last day of your sufferings and the beginning of a greater felicity than you enjoyed in damascus
6695,1594-135914-0040.flac,she then withdrew into the apartment she had occupied before her melancholy adventure
6696,1594-135914-0049.flac,because we wish to let them take some rest before we trouble them with our questions fetnah without knowing why felt a curiosity to see them the syndic would have conducted her to his house
6697,1594-135914-0043.flac,the syndic who was a most charitable man and spent above two thirds of his income in relieving poor strangers sick or in distress did not make fetnah wait knowing by her dress that she was a lady belonging to the palace i apply myself to you said she
6698,1594-135914-0062.flac,no doubt of it said fetnah interrupting her there he is no more guilty than you are i can assure you of his innocence for i am that very fetnah you so much complain of who through some fatality in my stars
6699,1594-135914-0022.flac,commander of the true believers said she if i have let fall any word that is not agreeable to your majesty i most humbly beseech you to forgive me but he whose innocence and wretched state you desire to be informed of
6700,1594-135914-0085.flac,the lady who just now spoke to you will acquaint you with the rest therefore think of nothing but recovering your health i will contribute all in my power towards it having spoke these words he left ganem to take his rest
6701,1594-135914-0127.flac,i give you to jaffir and you fetnah to ganem let a cauzee and witnesses be called and the three contracts be drawn up and signed immediately
6702,1594-135914-0099.flac,when she thought it was proper matters being so ordered the syndic announced fetnah's coming to the sick man who was so transported to see her that he was again near fainting away well ganem said she drawing near to his bed
6703,1594-135914-0091.flac,commander of the true believers said she i have been so successful that i have found him and also his mother and sister
6704,1594-135914-0015.flac,will not prevent your being condemned and punished for your violent and unjust proceedings here fetnah ceased her complaints her sighs and tears putting a stop to her utterance
6705,1594-135914-0114.flac,but i will go and make some provision for them this said she went to the palace and soon returned with a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold which she delivered to the syndic desiring him to buy apparel for the mother and daughter
6706,1594-135914-0117.flac,i am come from the commander of the true believers my master and yours the orders i have differ much from those which i do not wish to revive in your memory i am to bear you company
6707,1594-135914-0086.flac,exhausted by hard living and toil
6708,1594-135914-0059.flac,i had a son called ganem who coming to trade at bagdad has been accused of carrying off fetnah
6709,1594-135914-0033.flac,i believe all you have told me but why was it so long before you let me hear from you was there any need of staying a whole month after my return before you sent me word where you were commander of the true believers answered fetnah
6710,1594-135914-0026.flac,i owe this justice to his virtue to declare his behaviour was always suitable to his words you commander of the true believers well know with what rigour you have treated him and you will answer for it before the tribunal of god
6711,1594-135914-0101.flac,what miracle has restored you to my sight
6712,1594-135914-0069.flac,when ganem was with you fetnah would have proceeded but the syndic of the jewellers coming in interrupted her madam said he to her i come from seeing a very moving object it is a young man whom a camel driver had just carried to an hospital
6713,1594-135914-0048.flac,whilse she herself led them to our warm bath and gave them clean linen
6714,1594-135914-0009.flac,the uncertainty of whose fate was a killing affliction there was scarcely a moment in which she did not lament him
6715,1594-135914-0023.flac,is ganem the unhappy son of abu ayoub late a rich merchant of damascus he saved my life from a grave and afforded me a sanctuary in his house
6716,1594-135914-0089.flac,and to morrow morning i will return to you this said she embraced the mother and the daughter and went away as soon as she came to the palace
6717,1594-135914-0011.flac,stopped and drawing near the door to listen distinctly heard these words which fetnah whose thoughts were always on ganem uttered with a loud voice o ganem too unfortunate ganem where are you at this time
6718,1594-135914-0016.flac,he plainly perceived that if what he had heard was true his favourite must be innocent and that he had been too hasty in giving such orders against ganem and his family
6719,1594-135914-0054.flac,good woman said she i come to offer you my assistance i have considerable interest in this city and may be of service to you and your companion madam answered ganem's mother
6720,1594-135914-0052.flac,fetnah raised her up and said my good lady
6721,1594-135914-0067.flac,the wealth ganem had in this city is not lost it is in my apartment in the palace but i know all the treasure in the world cannot comfort you without ganem if i may judge of you by myself blood is no less powerful than love in great minds
6722,1594-135914-0104.flac,nothing is more certain answered the lady
6723,1594-135914-0073.flac,i have caused him to be brought to my own house by my slaves and they are now in a private room where i placed him putting on some of my own linen and treating him as they would do myself fetnah's heart beat at these words of the jeweller
6724,1594-135914-0126.flac,who shall become the first cause of your good fortune as she was of your past sufferings this is not all added he turning toward ganem's mother you are still young i believe you will not disdain to be allied to my grand vizier
6725,1594-135914-0032.flac,when she had done speaking
6726,1594-135914-0000.flac,in this miserable state they came to the first village the peasants wives flocked about them and as it appeared through their disguise that they were people of some condition asked them what was the occasion of their travelling in a habit that did not seem to belong to them
6727,1594-135914-0055.flac,that fetnah and the syndic's wife could not forbear letting fall some tears
6728,1594-135914-0063.flac,have occasioned you so many misfortunes to me you must impute the loss of your son if he is no more but if i have occasioned your misfortune i can in some measure relieve it
6729,1594-135914-0128.flac,but he was resolved to marry her haroon thought this such an extraordinary story that he ordered his historiographer to commit it to writing with all its circumstances
6730,1594-135914-0071.flac,and fancied his countenance was not altogether unknown to me i asked him some questions concerning his family and his country but all the answers i could get were sighs and tears i took pity on him
6731,1594-135914-0031.flac,and enlarging on the obligation she owed to ganem but above all she highly extolled his discretion
6732,1594-135914-0122.flac,after which he said to him ganem i will have you live in my court commander of the true believers answered the young merchant a slave has no will but his masters on whom his life and fortune depend
6733,1594-135914-0078.flac,it is not you that i address my imagination being overcharged with your image has given to a stranger a deceitful resemblance
6734,1594-135914-0038.flac,i must do more rejoined the prince in requital for having saved your life and the respect he has strewn for me to make amends for the loss of his fortune in short to repair the wrong i have done to himself and his family
6735,1594-135914-0050.flac,for they were the persons the syndic had been speaking of to fetnah the syndic's wife being informed by the slave that a lady from the palace was in her house was hastening to meet her but fetnah who had followed the slave did not give her time
6736,1594-135914-0039.flac,i give him to you for a husband
6737,1594-135914-0109.flac,the syndic himself and his wife were so moved at the spectacle that they could not forbear weeping nor sufficiently admire the secret workings of providence which had brought together into their house four persons whom fortune had so cruelly persecuted
6738,1594-135914-0124.flac,not questioning but that fetnah was in waiting with abou ayoub's widow and daughter he caused them to be called in they prostrated themselves before him he made them rise and was so charmed by jalib al koloob's beauty
6739,1594-135914-0014.flac,how can you exculpate yourself when you shall appear with ganem before the tribunal of the supreme judge and the angels shall testify the truth before your face all the power you are now invested with and which makes almost the whole world tremble
6740,1594-135914-0113.flac,as soon as ganem has recovered his health
6741,1594-135914-0058.flac,but suppressing her agitation and concern she suffered ganem's mother to proceed in the following manner
6742,1594-135914-0036.flac,i acknowledge my fault and would willingly make amends for it by heaping favours on the young merchant of damascus consider therefore what i can do for him ask what you think fit and i will grant it
6743,1594-135914-0120.flac,arabs persians egyptians africans and syrians of his own domaions not to mention strangers when the vizier had conducted ganem to the foot of the throne
6744,1594-135914-0012.flac,whither has thy cruel fate led thee alas it is i that have made you wretched why did you not let me perish miserably rather than afford me your generous relief what melancholy return have you received for your care and respect
6745,1594-135914-0001.flac,instead of answering the question they fell to weeping which only served to heighten the curiosity of the peasants and to move their compassion ganem's mother told them what she and her daughter had endured at which the good countrywomen were sensibly afflicted
6746,1594-135914-0094.flac,that your search has proved so successful it is a real satisfaction to me not so much for your sake as for my own i will keep the promise i have made you you shall marry ganem and i here declare you are no longer my slave you are free
6747,1594-135914-0080.flac,ah madam said he by what miracle he could say no more such a sudden transport of joy seized him that he fainted away fetnah and the syndic did all they could to bring him to himself
6748,1594-135914-0027.flac,i must make a confession which perhaps may displease you but i beg pardon of your majesty beforehand speak daughter said haroon al rousheed i forgive you all provided you conceal nothing from me well then replied fetnah
6749,1594-135914-0034.flac,ganem went abroad so very seldom that you need not wonder we were not the first that heard of your return besides ganem who took upon him to deliver the letter i wrote to noran nihar
6750,1594-135914-0045.flac,i am also satisfied that you prevent their wants and that nothing is more grateful to you than to have an opportunity of relieving their misery madam answered the syndic i shall obey your commands with pleasure but if you desire to exercise your charity in person
6751,1594-135914-0013.flac,the commander of the faithful who ought to have rewarded persecutes you and in requital for having always regarded me as a person reserved for his bed you lose your fortune and are obliged to seek for safety an flight
6752,1594-135914-0006.flac,thence notwithstanding all they had endured they proceeded to bagdad that was the place they had fixed their thoughts upon
6753,1594-135914-0030.flac,that which belongs to the master is forbidden to the slave this ingenuous confession
6754,1594-135914-0044.flac,putting the purse into his hands as a person whose piety is celebrated throughout the city i desire you to distribute that gold among the poor strangers you relieve for i know you make it your business to assist those who apply to your charity
6755,3607-135982-0050.flac,he knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly he leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands counting the beats of his temples
6756,3607-135982-0030.flac,they talked volubly and with little reserve jimmy whose imagination was kindling conceived the lively youth of the frenchman twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the englishman's manner a graceful image of this he thought an a just one
6757,3607-135982-0046.flac,jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience the wit was flashing play ran very high and paper began to pass jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing but it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards
6758,3607-135982-0010.flac,and had afterwards sent him to dublin university to study law jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a while he had money and he was popular and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles
6759,3607-135982-0019.flac,but jimmy who in spite of temporary errors was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together this knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness
6760,3607-135982-0047.flac,they were devils of fellows but he wished they would stop it was getting late someone gave the toast of the yacht the bell of newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish the piano had stopped villona must have gone up on deck
6761,3607-135982-0026.flac,in a haze of summer evening in jimmy's house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion a certain pride mingled with his parents trepidation a certain eagerness also to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue
6762,3607-135982-0043.flac,a man brought in a light supper and the young men sat down to it for form's sake they drank however it was bohemian they drank ireland england france hungary the united states of america jimmy made a speech a long speech
6763,3607-135982-0032.flac,riviere not wholly ingeniously undertook to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french mechanicians the resonant voice of the hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters
6764,3607-135982-0000.flac,the cars came scudding in towards dublin running evenly like pellets in the groove of the nass road
6765,3607-135982-0045.flac,the table was cleared villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them the other men played game after game flinging themselves boldly into the adventure they drank the health of the queen of hearts and of the queen of diamonds
6766,3607-135982-0036.flac,at the corner of grafton street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party andre it's farley
6767,3607-135982-0027.flac,and as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tied his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable his father therefore was unusually friendly with villona
6768,3607-135982-0021.flac,jimmy had a respect for his father's shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment money to be made in the motor business pots of money moreover segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth
6769,3607-135982-0018.flac,it was pleasant after that honor to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks then as to money he really had a great sum under his control
6770,3607-135982-0017.flac,at the control segouin had presented him to one of the french competitors and in answer to his confused murmur of compliment the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth
6771,3607-135982-0002.flac,the cars of their friends the french the french moreover were virtual victors their team had finished solidly they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning german car was reported a belgian
6772,3607-135982-0014.flac,decidedly villona was in excellent spirits he kept up a deep base hum of melody for miles of the road the frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase
6773,3607-135982-0001.flac,careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the continent sped its wealth and industry now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed their sympathy however was for the blue cars
6774,3607-135982-0011.flac,his father remonstrative but covertly proud of the excess had paid his bills and brought him home
6775,3607-135982-0009.flac,he had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the dublin newspapers as a merchant prince he had sent his son to england to be educated in a big catholic college
6776,3607-135982-0034.flac,the room grew doubly hot and segouin's task grew harder each moment there was even danger of personal spite the alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to humanity and when the toast had been drunk he threw open a window significantly
6777,3607-135982-0041.flac,villona said with conviction it is delightful there was a yacht piano in the cabin villona played a waltz for farley and riviere farley acting as cavalier and riviere as lady
6778,3607-135982-0025.flac,were to go home to dress the car steered out slowly for grafton street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers they walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise while the city hung its pale globes of light above them
6779,3607-135982-0013.flac,villona was entertaining also a brilliant pianist but unfortunately very poor the car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth the two cousins sat on the front seat jimmy and his hungarian friend sat behind
6780,3607-135982-0023.flac,and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal they drove down dame street the street was busy with unusual traffic loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram drivers
6781,3607-135982-0044.flac,villona saying hear hear whenever there was a pause there was a great clapping of hands when he sat down it must have been a good speech farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly what jovial fellows what good company they were cards cards
6782,3607-135982-0012.flac,who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in france such a person as his father agreed was well worth knowing even if he had not been the charming companion he was
6783,3607-135982-0039.flac,they were walking out of kingstown station the ticket collector saluted jimmy he was an old man fine night sor it was a serene summer night the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet
6784,3607-135982-0042.flac,then in impromptu square dance the men devising original figures what merriment jimmy took his part with a will this was seeing life at least then farley got out of breath and cried stop
6785,3607-135982-0048.flac,it was a terrible game they stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck jimmy understood that the game lay between routh and segouin what excitement jimmy was excited too he would lose of course how much had he written away
6786,3607-135982-0004.flac,in fact these four young men were almost hilarious they were charles segouin the owner of the car endre riviere a young electrician of canadian birth a huge hungarian named villona
6787,3607-135982-0031.flac,he admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation the five young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened villona with immense respect began to discover to the mildly surprised englishmen the beauties of the english madrigal
6788,3607-135982-0037.flac,a torrent of talk followed farley was an american no one knew very well what the talk was about vilona and riviere were the noisiest but all the men were excited they got up on a car squeezing themselves together amid much laughter
6789,3607-135982-0024.flac,near the bank segouin drew up and jimmy and his friend alighted a little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor the party was to dine together that evening in segouin's hotel and meanwhile jimmy and his friend who was staying with him
6790,3607-135982-0020.flac,and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance it was a serious thing for him
6791,3607-135982-0028.flac,and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the hungarian who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner the dinner was excellent exquisite
6792,3607-135982-0022.flac,jimmy set out to translate into day's work that lordly car in which he sat how smoothly it ran in what style they had come careering along the country roads the journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life
6793,3607-135982-0040.flac,they proceeded towards it with linked arms singing cadet roussel in a chorus stamping their feet at every ho ho ho hey vrement they got into a row boat at the slip and made out for the american's yacht there was to be supper music cards
6794,3607-135982-0007.flac,and besides he was an optimist by nature the fourth member of the party however was too excited to be genuinely happy he was about twenty six years of age with a soft light brown moustache and rather innocent looking gray eyes
6795,3607-135982-0008.flac,his father who had begun life as an advanced nationalist had modified his views early he had made his money as a butcher in kingstown and by opening shops in dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over
6796,3607-135982-0051.flac,the cabin door opened and he saw the hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light
6797,3607-135982-0035.flac,that night the city wore the mask of a capital the five young men strolled along stephen's green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke they talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders the people made way for them
6798,3607-135982-0038.flac,to a music of merry bells
6799,3607-135982-0049.flac,the men rose to their feet to play the last tricks talking and gesticulating routh won the cabin shook with the young men's cheering and the cards were bundled together they began then to gather in what they had won farley and jimmy were the heaviest losers
6800,3607-135982-0033.flac,when segouin shepherded his party into politics here was congenial ground for all jimmy under generous influences felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him he aroused the torpid routh at last
6801,3607-135982-0015.flac,this was not altogether pleasant for him as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind besides villona's humming would confuse anybody the noise of the car too
6802,3607-135982-0016.flac,rapid motion through space elates one so does notoriety so does the possession of money these were three good reasons for jimmy's excitement he had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these continentals
6803,3607-135982-0005.flac,and a neatly groomed young man named doyle segouin was in a good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance he was about to start a motor establishment in paris
6804,3607-135982-0006.flac,and riviere was in good humor because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment these two young men who were cousins were also in good humor because of the success of the french cars villona was in good humor because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon
6805,3607-135982-0029.flac,segouin jimmy decided had a very refined taste the party was increased by a young englishman named routh whom jimmy had seen with segouin at cambridge the young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps
6806,3607-135982-0003.flac,each blue car therefore received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car in one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present
6807,3607-29116-0045.flac,heaven protect me from such a charge that is what dilworthy said and yet when you come to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the services of some of our ablest men sir if the country were opposed to to bribery it is a harsh term i do not like to use it
6808,3607-29116-0026.flac,uncle dilworthy uncle balloon tells very amusing stories when ladies are not present i should think so eighty five there i must find that chairman queer buckstone x
6809,3607-29116-0032.flac,and then hicks went on with a serious air colonel if you register a letter it means that it is of value doesn't it and if you pay fifteen cents for registering it the government will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it is lost isn't that so
6810,3607-29116-0031.flac,and perhaps that didn't lessen the relish of the conversation to the correspondents it seems that they had got hold of the drygoods box packing story about balloon one day and were talking it over when the colonel came in the colonel wanted to know all about it and hicks told him
6811,3607-29116-0021.flac,i suppose he will paint pub docks on them and frank them home that's good economy isn't it yes yes but child all congressmen do that it may not be strictly honest indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in with the clothes
6812,3607-29116-0041.flac,we have many truly noble statesmen in our country service like balloon the senate is full of them don't you think so colonel well i don't now i honor my country's public servants as much as anyone can i meet them sir every day and the more i see of them
6813,3607-29116-0023.flac,eracing figuring and talking to herself free i wonder what dilworthy does think of me anyway one two eight seventeen
6814,3607-29116-0029.flac,and more than she thought proper to tell him she was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young fellows of newspaper row and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual advantage
6815,3607-29116-0024.flac,wouldn't dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some of the things balloon did say to me there hopperson's influence ought to count twenty the sanctimonious old cormudgn son in law synecure in the negro institution that about gauges him the three committeemen
6816,3607-29116-0034.flac,it was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch of humour about it too i think there is more real talent among our public men of to day than there was among those of old times a far more fertile fancy a much happier ingenuity
6817,3607-29116-0020.flac,but he is right at heart his term expires next year and i fear we shall lose him he seemed to be packing the day i was there his rooms were full of dry goods boxes into which his servant was crowding all manner of old clothes and stuff
6818,3607-29116-0033.flac,yes i suppose it's so well senator balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those seven huge boxes of old clothes and shipped that ton of second hand rubbish old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as registered matter
6819,3607-29116-0028.flac,but as he lodged near the bookstore she would drop in there and keep a look out for him while laura is on her errand to find mister buckstone it may not be out of the way to remark that she knew quite as much of washington life as senator dilworthy gave her credit for
6820,3607-29116-0025.flac,sons in law nothing like a son in law here in washington or a brother in law and everybody has em let's see sixty one with places twenty five persuaded it is getting on we'll have two thirds of congress in time dilworthy must surely know i understand him
6821,3607-29116-0036.flac,i have a much greater admiration for senator balloon yes balloon is a man of parts there is no denying it i think so he is spoken of for the post of minister to china or austria and i hope will be appointed
6822,3607-29116-0027.flac,seemed to be in love i was sure of it he promised to come here and he hasn't strange very strange i must chance to meet him to day laura dressed and went out thinking she was perhaps too early for mister buckstone to come from the house
6823,3607-29116-0035.flac,now colonel can you picture jefferson or washington or john adams franking their wardrobes through the mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government responsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents statesmen were dull creatures in those days
6824,3607-29116-0022.flac,it's a funny world good bye uncle i'm going to see that chairman and humming a cheery opera air she departed to her room to dress for going out before she did that however she took out her note book and was soon deep in its contents marking dashing
6825,3607-29116-0042.flac,of securing their services few lands are so blessed that is true colonel to be sure you can buy now and then a senator or a representative but they do not know it is wrong and so they are not ashamed of it they are gentle and confiding and childlike
6826,3607-29116-0040.flac,that is to say he charged nothing more than the lumber would bring but the poor injuns not that i care much for injuns what did he do for them gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with governor balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor indians but balloon is not alone
6827,3607-29116-0043.flac,and in my opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of
6828,3607-29116-0030.flac,they were always talking in the row everlastingly gossiping bantering and sarcastically praising things and going on in a style which was a curious commingling of earnest and persiflage colonel sellers liked this talk amazingly though he was sometimes a little at sea in it
6829,3607-29116-0039.flac,whose land had been taken from them by the white man in the interests of civilization but balloon knew their needs better he built a government saw mill on the reservation with the money and the lumber sold for enormous prices a relative of his did all the work free of charge
6830,3607-29116-0044.flac,i quite agree with you colonel sellers well hesitated the colonel i am afraid some of them do buy their seats yes i am afraid they do but as senator dilworthy himself said to me it is sinful it is very wrong it is shameful
6831,3607-29116-0037.flac,what we want abroad is good examples of the national character john jay and benjamin franklin were well enough in their day but the nation has made progress since then balloon is a man we know and can depend on to be true to himself
6832,3607-29116-0038.flac,yes and balloon has had a good deal of public experience he is an old friend of mine he was governor of one of the territories a while and was very satisfactory indeed he was he was ex officio a indian agent too
6833,3607-29116-0010.flac,if it was not to aid in the salvation of his fellow men the senator spoke with feeling and then added i hope you showed hopperson that our motives were pure yes and he seemed to have a new light on the measure i think we'll vote for it
6834,3607-29116-0002.flac,and the senator beamed with his own congressional wit in the committee of the whole things are working very well we have made ever so much progress in a week i believe that you and i together could run this government beautifully uncle the senator beamed again
6835,3607-29116-0011.flac,i hope so his name will give tone and strength to it i knew you would only have to show him that it was just and pure in order to secure his cordial support i think i convinced him yes i am perfectly sure he will vote right now
6836,3607-29116-0008.flac,and for the good of the colored race much as i am interested in the heirs of this property and would like to have them succeed laura looked a little incredulous and the senator proceeded don't misunderstand me i don't deny that it is for the interest of all of us that this bill should go through and it will
6837,3607-29116-0004.flac,i don't know any man in congress i'd sooner go to for help in any christian work what did he say oh he beat around a little he said he should like to help the negro his heart went out to the negro and all that plenty of them say that but he was a little afraid of the tennessee land bill
6838,3607-29116-0013.flac,running his eye down the list that's encouraging what is the c before some of the names and the b b those are my private marks that c stands for convinced with argument
6839,3607-29116-0003.flac,he liked to be called uncle by this beautiful woman did you see hopperson last night after the congressional prayer meeting yes he came he's a kind of eh he is one of my friends laura he's a fine man a very fine man
6840,3607-29116-0015.flac,but he has charitable impulses if we secure him we shall have a favorable report by the committee
6841,3607-29116-0006.flac,i have been with him a great deal on conference committees he wants reasons good ones didn't you show him he was an error about the bill i did i went over the whole thing i had to tell him some of the side arrangements some of the you didn't mention me
6842,3607-29116-0016.flac,oh i saw senator balloon he will help us i suppose balloon is a wholehearted fellow i can't help loving that man for all his drollery and waggishness he puts on an air of levity sometimes but there ain't a man in the senate knows the scriptures as he does
6843,3607-29116-0009.flac,i have no concealments from you but i have one principle in my public life which i should like you to keep in mind it has always been my guide i never push a private interest if it is not justified and ennobled by some larger public good
6844,3607-29116-0019.flac,my daughter said the senator with a grave look i trust there was nothing free in his manner free repeated laura with indignation in her face with me there there child i meant nothing balloon talks a little freely sometimes with men
6845,3607-29116-0014.flac,i expect to see the chairman of the committee to day mister buckstone
6846,3607-29116-0012.flac,that's good that's good said the senator smiling and rubbing his hands is there anything more you'll find some changes in that i guess handing the senator a printed list of names those checked off are all right ah
6847,3607-29116-0000.flac,laura went downstairs knocked at the study door and entered scarcely waiting for the response senator dilworthy was alone with an open bible in his hand upside down laura smiled and said forgetting her acquired correctness of speech it is only me
6848,3607-29116-0017.flac,he did not make any objections not exactly he said shall i tell you what he said asked laura glancing furtively at him certainly he said he had no doubt it was a good thing if senator dilworthy was in it it would pay to look into it
6849,3607-29116-0007.flac,oh no i told him you were daft about the negro in the philanthropy part of it as you are daft is a little strong laura but you know that i wouldn't touch this bill
6850,3607-29116-0005.flac,if senator dilworthy wasn't in it he should suspect there was a fraud on the government he said that did he yes and he said he felt he couldn't vote for it he was shy not shy child cautious he's a very cautious man
6851,3607-29116-0001.flac,ah come in sit down and the senator closed the book and laid it down i wanted to see you
6852,3607-29116-0018.flac,the senator laughed but rather feebly and said balloon is always full of his jokes i explained it to him he said it was all right he only wanted a word with you continued laura he is a handsome old gentleman and he is gallant for an old man
6853,412-126975-0021.flac,he took no notice of the girl's alarmed adjuration but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her where he might very well have broken his legs i think i was meant to be a burglar
6854,412-126975-0005.flac,if i make myself clear in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral town similarly in france when i had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant
6855,412-126975-0087.flac,like all true christian benefactors anonymous the harlequin already clad in silver paper out of cigar boxes was with difficulty
6856,412-126975-0082.flac,you see an english interior open a moonlit garden it all goes by magic and snatching a chance piece of billiard chalk from his pocket he ran it across the hall floor
6857,412-126975-0049.flac,i won't have you talking like that cried the girl who was in a curious glow you've only talked like that since you became a horrid what's his name you know what i mean
6858,412-126975-0028.flac,oh that's my godfather sir leopold fisher he always comes on boxing day then after an innocent pause which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm
6859,412-126975-0027.flac,and stood throbbing hullo hullo said the young man with the red tie here's somebody born on the right side anyhow i didn't know miss adams that your santa claus was so modern as this
6860,412-126975-0029.flac,ruby adams added he is very kind john krook journalist had heard of that eminent city magnate and it was not his fault if the city magnate
6861,412-126975-0019.flac,was a tall angular young man with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush intelligent and even distinguished lineaments but a sallow and almost alien complexion
6862,412-126975-0018.flac,oh don't jump mister crook she called out in some alarm it's much too high the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse
6863,412-126975-0023.flac,how can you say such things she remonstrated well said the young man if you're born on the wrong side of the wall i can't see that it's wrong to climb over it
6864,412-126975-0001.flac,was also by a singular coincidence my last it was committed at christmas as an artist
6865,412-126975-0086.flac,that strangely resembled the large lamp shade in the drawing room the clown and pantaloom made themselves white with flour from the cook and red with rouge from some other domestic who remained
6866,412-126975-0043.flac,with an unaffected vain glory that had something disarming about it he held out the case before them all it flew open at a touch and half blinded them
6867,412-126975-0004.flac,among the lights and screens of the cafe riche thus in england if i wished to relieve a deen of his riches which is not so easy as you might suppose i wished to frame him
6868,412-126975-0092.flac,why is he so wild he is harlequin to your columbine said crook i am only the clown who makes the old jokes i wish you were the harlequin
6869,412-126975-0022.flac,he said placidly and i have no doubt i should have been if i hadn't happened to be born in that nice house next door i can't see any harm in it anyhow
6870,412-126975-0083.flac,half way between the front door and the staircase to mark the line of the footlights how even such a banquet of boch was got ready in the time remained a riddle
6871,412-126975-0032.flac,and began to unpack him like some very carefully protected parcel rugs enough to stock a bazarre furs of all the beasts of the forest and scarves of all the colours of the rainbow
6872,412-126975-0091.flac,to the coat tails of sir leopold fisher this however was frowned down uncle is too absurd cried ruby to crook round whose shoulders she had seriously placed a string of sausages
6873,412-126975-0010.flac,i repented the same evening flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside and even from the inside it was odd seen from the outside
6874,412-126975-0066.flac,lead fisher to say in his most sarcastic magisterial manner no doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat what is it pray
6875,412-126975-0052.flac,does a socialist mean a man who desires a social evening with the chimney sweep a socialist means a man who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney sweeps paid for it but who won't allow you
6876,412-126975-0014.flac,the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds filling them as it were with the ghosts of the dead roses
6877,412-126975-0038.flac,everything seemed undistinguished about the priest even down to his name which was brown yet the colonel had always found something companionable about him and frequently asked him to such family gatherings
6878,412-126975-0020.flac,this showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie the only part of his costume of which he seemed to take any care perhaps it was a symbol
6879,412-126975-0041.flac,over which hung the colonel's sword the process was completed and the company including the saturnine crook presented to sir leopold fisher that venerable financier however
6880,412-126975-0045.flac,fisher stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the colonel the wonder of the whole group
6881,412-126975-0057.flac,now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset the scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint like a back scene in a play that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the door
6882,412-126975-0090.flac,he put a paper donkey's head unexpectedly on father brown who bore it patiently and even found some private manner of moving his ears he even essayed to put the paper donkey's tail
6883,412-126975-0089.flac,she had worn at a fancy dress party as the queen of diamonds indeed her uncle james blount was getting almost out of hand in his excitement he was like a schoolboy
6884,412-126975-0062.flac,of course of course replied the colonel carelessly my dear chap any friend of yours no doubt he will prove an acquisition
6885,412-126975-0071.flac,or something blue beards more in my line and him i like best when he turned into the pantaloon i'm all for making a policeman into sausages said john crook
6886,412-126975-0037.flac,with him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighboring roman church for the colonel's late wife had been a catholic and the children as is common in such cases had been trained to follow her
6887,412-126975-0093.flac,she said and left the string of sausages swinging father brown though he knew every detail done behind the scenes and had even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime baby
6888,412-126975-0044.flac,it was just as if a crystal fountain had spurted in their eyes in a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all round them
6889,412-126975-0084.flac,but they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry that lives when youth is in a house and youth was in that house that night though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from which it flamed
6890,412-126975-0042.flac,still seemed struggling with portions of his well lined attire and at length produced from a very interior tail coat pocket a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his christmas present for his goddaughter
6891,412-126975-0054.flac,with speculation in his eye i've heard that gardeners use it and i once made six children happy at christmas when the conjuror didn't come entirely with soot applied externally
6892,412-126975-0000.flac,the flying stars the most beautiful crime i ever committed flambeaux would say in his highly moral old age
6893,412-126975-0007.flac,well my last crime was a christmas crime a cheery cosy english middle class crime a crime of charles dickens
6894,412-126975-0006.flac,which is almost impossible it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars and those solemn plains of gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of milee
6895,412-126975-0033.flac,were unwrapped one by one till they revealed something resembling the human form the form of a friendly but foreign looking old gentleman with a gray goat like beard and a beaming smile
6896,412-126975-0039.flac,in the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for sir leopold and the removal of his raps porch and vestibule indeed
6897,412-126975-0059.flac,mister blount started and stopped in his shout of assent ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it his face clouded a little and then cleared and he turned to his brother in law and host
6898,412-126975-0015.flac,on one side of the house stood the stable on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind the young lady having scattered bread for the birds
6899,412-126975-0079.flac,you ought to have a statue cried the canadian as he came back radiant from the telephone there we are all fitted mister crook shall be clown
6900,412-126975-0056.flac,and the astonished financier his in some considerable deprecation when a knock sounded at the double front doors the priest opened them and they showed again the front garden of evergreens monkey tree and all
6901,412-126975-0009.flac,a house with a monkey tree enough you know the species i really think my imitation of dickens's style was dexterous and literary it seems almost a pity
6902,412-126975-0048.flac,growled the man in the red tie i shouldn't blame em if they had taken em when they ask for bread and you don't even give em a stone i think they might take the stone for themselves
6903,412-126975-0002.flac,i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe as if for a statuary group
6904,412-126975-0094.flac,went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee the spectators were few relations one or two local friends
6905,412-126975-0040.flac,were unduly large in proportion to the house and formed as it were a big room with the front door at one end and the bottom of the staircase at the other in front of the large hall fire
6906,412-126975-0017.flac,here she gave an exclamation of wonder real or ritual and looking up at the high garden wall above her beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure
6907,412-126975-0016.flac,for the fourth or fifth time that day because the dog ate it passed unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glittering plantation of evergreens behind
6908,412-126975-0068.flac,what i say is let's do something for the company to night not blacking faces or sitting on hats if you don't like those but something of the sort why couldn't we have a proper old english pantomime
6909,412-126975-0034.flac,who rubbed his big fur gloves together long before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch had opened in the middle and colonel adams father of the furry young lady
6910,412-126975-0063.flac,he'll black his face if that's what you mean cried blount laughing i don't doubt he'd black everyone else's eyes i don't care i'm not refined
6911,412-126975-0080.flac,he's a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes i can be harlequin that only wants long legs and jumping about my friend florian phones he's bringing the police costume he's changing on the way
6912,412-126975-0025.flac,and which is the right side of the wall asked the young lady smiling whichever side you are on said the young man named crook
6913,412-126975-0011.flac,it was perfectly incomprehensible and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it from this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable
6914,412-126975-0053.flac,put in the priest in a low voice to own your own soot crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect does one want to own soot he asked one might
6915,412-126975-0024.flac,i never know what you will say or do next she said i don't often know myself replied mister crook but then i am on the right side of the wall now
6916,412-126975-0081.flac,we can act it in this very hall the audience sitting on those broad stairs opposite one row above another these front doors can be the back scene either open or shut shut
6917,412-126975-0050.flac,a saint said father brown i think said sir leopold with a supercilious smile that ruby means a socialist
6918,412-126975-0047.flac,but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them i might have lost them on the road here it was quite possible quite natural i should say
6919,412-126975-0031.flac,which was rather a long process a large neat chauffeur in green got out from the front and a small neat man servant in grey got out from the back and between them they deposited sir leopold on the doorstep
6920,412-126975-0008.flac,i did it in a good old middle class house near putney a house with a crescent of carriage drive a house with a stable by the side of it a house with the name on the two outer gates
6921,412-126975-0013.flac,but her figure was beyond conjecture for she was so wrapped up in brown furs that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur but for the attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear
6922,412-126975-0051.flac,a radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes remarked crook with some impatience and a conservative does not mean a man who preserves jam neither i assure you
6923,412-126975-0060.flac,i'm sick at being such a nuisance colonel he said with the cheery colonial conventions but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here to night on business in point of fact it's florian
6924,412-126975-0070.flac,and i find the things extinct nothing but a lot of snivelling fairy plays i want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages and they give me princesses moralizing by moonlight blue birds
6925,412-126975-0055.flac,oh splendid cried ruby oh i wish you'd do it to this company the boisterous canadian mister blount was lifting his loud voice in applause
6926,412-126975-0075.flac,haven't killed a policeman lately blount frowned thoughtfully a space and then smote his thigh yes we can he cried i've got florian's address here
6927,412-126975-0078.flac,you must get some one else for pantaloon i will be pantaloon if you like said colonel adams taking his cigar out of his mouth and speaking for the first and last time
6928,412-126975-0069.flac,clown columbine and so on i saw one when i left england at twelve years old and it's blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since i came back to the old country only last year
6929,412-126975-0065.flac,don't let's quarrel there are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat dislike of the red tied youth born of his predatory opinions and evident intimacy with the pretty godchild
6930,412-126975-0064.flac,i like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat not on mine please said sir leopold fisher with dignity well well observed crook airily
6931,412-126975-0058.flac,he was dusty looking and in a frayed coat evidently a common messenger any of you gentlemen mister blount he asked and held forward a letter doubtfully
6932,412-126975-0072.flac,it's a better definition of socialism than some recently given but surely the get up would be too big a business not a scrap cried blount quite carried away
6933,412-126975-0073.flac,a harlequinades the quickest thing we can do for two reasons first one can gag to any degree and second all the objects are household things
6934,412-126975-0077.flac,almost dancing i'll be columbine and you shall be pantaloon the millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heathen solemnity i think my dear he said
6935,412-126975-0088.flac,prevented from smashing the old victorian lustre chandeliers that he might cover himself with resplendent crystals in fact he would certainly have done so had not ruby unearthed some old pantomime paste jewels
6936,412-126975-0030.flac,had not heard of him for in certain articles in the clarion or the new age sir leopold had been dealt with austerely but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motor car
6937,412-126975-0067.flac,letting a top hat sit on you for instance said the socialist now now now cried the canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence don't let's spoil a jolly evening
6938,412-126975-0085.flac,as always happens the invention grew wilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had to create the columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt
6939,412-126975-0046.flac,i had to be careful of em coming down they're the three great african diamonds called the flying stars because they've been stolen so often all the big criminals are on the track
6940,412-126975-0003.flac,thus squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak while jews on the other hand should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless
6941,412-126975-0012.flac,opened on the garden with the monkey tree and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes
6942,412-126975-0026.flac,as they went together through the laurels toward the front garden a motor horn sounded thrice coming nearer and nearer and a car of splendid speed great elegance
6943,412-126975-0036.flac,or pasha's in egypt with him was his brother in law lately come from canada a big and rather boisterous young gentleman farmer with a yellow beard by name james blount
6944,412-126975-0035.flac,had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside he was a tall sun burnt and very silent man who wore a red smoking cap like a fez making him look like one of the english sirders
6945,412-126975-0074.flac,tables and towel horses and washing baskets and things like that that's true admitted crook nodding eagerly and walking about but i'm afraid i can't have my policeman's uniform
6946,412-126975-0061.flac,that famous french acrobat and comic actor i knew him years ago out west he was a french canadian by birth and he seems to have business for me though i hardly guess what
6947,412-126975-0076.flac,and he knows every costumir in london i'll phone him to bring a police dress when he comes and he went bounding away to the telephone oh it's glorious godfather
6948,6064-300880-0030.flac,he observed to mister harmon what is he making all the fuss about inquired that gentleman as the visitor again applied himself forcefully to the bell wants to see mister remsen
6949,6064-300880-0005.flac,what's the matter with an old man make up at the front door just this friend murphy on watch hauls out his little paper and on the chance of its being me slaps the wrist of anybody who appears on those steps
6950,6064-300880-0031.flac,but the old bull dog of a butler won't let him put his nose inside the door says his name is cartier and he's come all the way from england to see him england not roddy cateret
6951,6064-300880-0010.flac,plumb in the dead center of noware thirteen miles from a railroad fishing and hunting on the premises reads like a real estate man's prospectus observed remsen this year pursued harmon
6952,6064-300880-0015.flac,get yourself a car from the garage and motor to the bungalow that's at the third corner of my little triangular piece of mountain and forest
6953,6064-300880-0035.flac,decided the coller argument followed while the chauffeur burrowed into the mechanism of his car it ended by the englishman bestowing two dollars upon mister murphy to get a message to mister remsen containing a protest and an address
6954,6064-300880-0028.flac,when he was restored to his feet and his breath and the taxi had ceased to imitate ferfner the dragon a tall figure in an extremely english ulster which had hastily emerged from the remsen front door rushed down ten steps
6955,6064-300880-0036.flac,the two gentlemen then moved away in the extinguished taxi tickets had been provided by the forethoughtful harmon the fugitive was the first man in the parlor car
6956,6064-300880-0013.flac,they won't thank you when they meet across the dinner table oh it isn't as bad as that they'll be a mile apart the lees will be at the cottage they get off at meredith and go in on the truck the woods i'm sending to the island
6957,6064-300880-0009.flac,tested it at every point and pronounced it perfect but we've forgotten one point said remsen at the end of the discussion what's that where do i go when i get out where do you want to go
6958,6064-300880-0012.flac,one half won't know how the other half lives till they get there i've loaned the place to both couples for a fortnight it's a dead secret neither couple knows where the other is going they're on oath
6959,6064-300880-0004.flac,why not dress apart and walk away incognito oh certainly assented the other with bitterness put on a suit of tights and dive out of the conservatory window disguised as annette kellerman i suppose
6960,6064-300880-0024.flac,fortified by my accent it is most convincing that'll be carteret who rodney carteret am i suppose to know him rather
6961,6064-300880-0021.flac,i've got some things to attend to now about our jail breaking scheme i've got an amendment how would it be if the taxi i arrive in should catch fire at the psychological moment can it be done
6962,6064-300880-0011.flac,i'm keeping open house for a special reason two fellows i know are getting married to morrow it's a double wedding it's also a double honeymoon but they aren't on to that yet harmon's clear brown eyes twinkled
6963,6064-300880-0037.flac,and were shown into drawing room a at the upper end of the car shortly after another couple also glistening as to garb entered and took possession of drawing room b at the lower end of the car
6964,6064-300880-0000.flac,five times mister thomas harmon vainly rang the bell of the remsen mansion while engaged upon the sixth variation he became aware of a face in the window scrutinizing him all right called the face
6965,6064-300880-0016.flac,wouldn't know them if i did any other agreeable surprises about the resort no oh yes i nearly forgot there's a little friend of gloria green girl tired out
6966,6064-300880-0007.flac,presently you will be seen coming down again unable to effect an entrance against the watchfulness of the faithful conner
6967,6064-300880-0001.flac,laid up inquired mister harmon shaking hands bottled up answered the young man gloomily can i help possibly did you ever kill a sepena server
6968,6064-300880-0002.flac,not yet care to try what does the thing look like cast your eyes toward the avenue and you'll see one
6969,6064-300880-0032.flac,it was done almost as well as that accomplished actor mister jacob remsen could have done it harmon sprang across the street
6970,6064-300880-0033.flac,he called what on earth are you doing over here the bell ringer adjusted a monocle and ambled down the steps to shake hands
6971,6064-300880-0017.flac,too much gayety or something don't know what it is or who she is but she's up against it for a month's rest so miss green wished her on bolder brook and welcome where does she go inquired remsen suspiciously
6972,6064-300880-0034.flac,perhaps you can tell me what's amiss with this beastly house i'll tell you proffered the obliging and innocent mister murphy he did so then i'll just go back and jolly well camt there till somebody jolly well lets me in
6973,6064-300880-0003.flac,he never asks questions about other people's troubles he now busied himself in thought haven't you any of your amateur theatrical duds here was the outcome of his cogitations all of em
6974,6064-300880-0018.flac,to the cave or the castle or the crags or the haunted manor house or the co educational club or which one of the numerous institutions you maintain in your private city she goes to the farmhouse
6975,6064-300880-0023.flac,you'll see the englishest lookin englishman you ever set eyes on outside the pages of punch trying to tear my old fashioned doorbell out by the roots that's your best make up is it remsen
6976,6064-300880-0029.flac,and leisurely climbed them again was wrenching violently at the bell for a time mister murphy regarded him disdainfully then crossed over held brief colloquy and returned hot chance he's got of breaking in
6977,6064-300880-0019.flac,missus bond my housekeeper is looking after her seclusion is her watchword if you see her make a noise like a dry leaf and blow away you'll go won't you remsen meditated
6978,6064-300880-0026.flac,him i mean and take em to the nine o'clock train for boulder brook in my taxi righto old thing be here at eight thirty cheerio said his host britishly
6979,6064-300880-0025.flac,not know a man with whom you toured for two months in japan said remsen reproachfully stupid of me confessed harmon grinning carteray good old roddy certainly then i'd better capture you
6980,6064-300880-0022.flac,easily i'm not a manufacturer of chemicals for nothing great keep it going for ten seconds for the benefit of the watchful murphy and if you look up after that
6981,6064-300880-0020.flac,it certainly seems made to order and it's mighty good of you old man yes i'll just take you up on that there's a train at nine o'clock in the morning to morrow make it the day after
6982,6064-300880-0008.flac,i get you i'm to be in disguise but how shall we get the process server off guard leave that to me the two conspirators elaborated their plan built it up revised it
6983,6064-300880-0014.flac,they climb out at ashland and go over by boat unless they all happen to take the same train one pair won't even know the other as around until they meet up on the lake or in the woods sounds like a party doesn't it want to join
6984,6064-300880-0006.flac,merely a matter of distracting friend murphy's attention for ten seconds at the end of the ten seconds you will be seen going up the steps to the front door
6985,6064-300880-0027.flac,from its window emerged a heavy puff of smoke from its door emerged mister thomas harmon who rolled upon the pavement apparently strangling mister murphy rushed to his aid
6986,6064-300880-0038.flac,the eluder of justice eyed them and drew his own conclusions here we are all of us he said to himself retiring discreetly behind his newspaper
6987,6064-56165-0034.flac,how can you criticize edith's brother don't let her do it edith it doesn't trouble me answered the placid edith i know all about philip and he's good enough for me that's right said nora
6988,6064-56165-0005.flac,i should say not exclaimed nora but belle who had some new york cousins was silent brenda however noticing belle's expression and not feeling disposed to side completely with nora said
6989,6064-56165-0017.flac,he only looked a little sheepish the other fellow said
6990,6064-56165-0035.flac,he says there are two or three fellows just sponging off of philip all the time and philip is too good natured to say anything i wonder how he'll like julia said edith
6991,6064-56165-0003.flac,and he would grow almost enthusiastic when describing the tussle between ned brown and stanley hooper over the respective merits of boston and new york in which hooper the new yorker was terribly beaten and upon my word he concluded
6992,6064-56165-0020.flac,although he had belonged to the illustrious organization a very short time well i think you're perfectly horrid cried brenda i mean the dicky i've heard about the way you make people suffer branding them with hot cigars and making them run barefoot winter nights and
6993,6064-56165-0010.flac,philip looked over his shoulder in the glass there was nothing the matter with his own shapely nose and i doubt that he would have run any such risk as edith suggested perhaps this was the reason why philip was not a fighter
6994,6064-56165-0028.flac,she's invited to my cooking party next week said nora you know that you've accepted too so you'll see her oh yes by the way said philip what evening is it friday of course replied nora
6995,6064-56165-0029.flac,so we can sit up late without thinking about school the next day well you'll see me sure said philip but see here it's five o'clock now and i have an engagement down town
6996,6064-56165-0013.flac,how funny you are edith said belle you never hear anything hasn't any one told you how the other fellows made him run blindfolded in his shirt sleeves down beacon street no really
6997,6064-56165-0015.flac,oh it gives a fellow a chance to show what kind of stuff he's made of explained philip whether he has good manners and whether he's clever and all that there must be better ways of showing bravery
6998,6064-56165-0006.flac,you're terribly narrow nora to think that nobody's any good unless he comes from boston i didn't say so replied nora no but that's what you mean and i'm surprised philip blair
6999,6064-56165-0024.flac,interrupted philip i've heard that some professors say that their annax classes do better work than ours but anybody can tell that that's all rot i believe it's all perfectly true said nora
7000,6064-56165-0014.flac,and everybody looking at him oh said one girl and oh said another and how silly they all cried together if girls amuse themselves like that what fun you'd make of us said the practical nora
7001,6064-56165-0032.flac,and it was not often that he condescended to spend as long a time in their presence as had been the case this afternoon do you think that philip looks very well edith
7002,6064-56165-0012.flac,oh say did you hear about the time will hardon had with the dicky last week he asked nora nodded she too had a brother in college what was it asked edith you haven't told me philip
7003,6064-56165-0033.flac,replied philip's sister it seems to me he was just a little pale he is always pale said edith do you suppose he sits up too late asked brenda i'll warrant he doesn't study too much said belle
7004,6064-56165-0023.flac,oh see here it would just spoil everything to have women in the classes with us are you afraid they'd get ahead of you asked edith gently now look here edith
7005,6064-56165-0009.flac,how queer girls are do you always fight like this when you are together we don't fight like you boys answered edith good humoredly we don't knock each other down and run the risk of breaking one another's noses
7006,6064-56165-0022.flac,oh they hate to see these girls going about with books and trying to get into harvard yes trying to break down the walls said nora sarcastically
7007,6064-56165-0031.flac,though only about four years their senior he seemed much older than brenda and her friends years before they had all been playmates together but his two years in college had taken him away from them
7008,6064-56165-0011.flac,there was one good thing about the little disputes in which brenda and belle indulged they very seldom lasted long in the present instance the girls were ashamed of having shown temper before philip
7009,6064-56165-0021.flac,there are a lot of girls studying in cambridge now at the annex and the fellows don't like it at all well i declare exclaimed nora i'd like to know what difference it makes to them
7010,6064-56165-0030.flac,philip hurried off bowing in a very grown up way to the group of girls for whatever criticisms anyone might make about philip's indolence and disinclination to study no one could deny that he had very good manners
7011,6064-56165-0004.flac,i wasn't sorry for the new york set is getting just unbearable i wouldn't so much mind fighting stanley hooper myself about new york and boston i guess i'd show him that new york isn't the whole world
7012,6064-56165-0026.flac,does julia wear glasses or look green i beg your pardon brenda no she doesn't said nora shortly she's about the nicest girl i know oh she is lovely added edith
7013,6064-56165-0018.flac,he walked off as nice as you please wasn't he mad at the two fellows for taking him there of course not that's a part of the thing why there are fellows in cambridge who would go through fire and water
7014,6064-56165-0000.flac,he was a harvard sophomore and realized his own importance quite as much as the girls did but still there was always the chance that he would come into the room just for a minute and tell them some of the latest cambridge news
7015,6064-56165-0016.flac,said the practical edith i don't believe you know a bit more about will hardon's bravery than you did before we knew something about his manners what why when he saw where he was he didn't run away or flunk out
7016,6064-56165-0025.flac,well i wish myself that our english instructor hadn't such a fondness for reading themes to us that the girls have written he makes out that they are better than ours but i can't say that i see it myself who gets the best marks
7017,6064-56165-0036.flac,hastily interposed belle boys never like a girl who studies especially one who is going to college well julia is just the nicest girl i know said nora repeating the words she had used to philip
7018,6064-56165-0001.flac,he would have scorned to call it gossip if there was any one thing in the world he hated so he said it was girl's talk this jabbering about nothing for his part he wouldn't waste his time that way
7019,6064-56165-0008.flac,no that's just it you don't treat her decently
7020,6064-56165-0007.flac,well you'd better talk brenda barlow broke in nora again just see the way you treat julia if she'd been born in boston i don't treat her interrupted brenda
7021,6064-56165-0002.flac,yet when he had an appreciative audience and girls generally appreciated what philips said he would often spend as much as half an hour talking about the fellows
7022,6064-56165-0019.flac,or stand on their heads in front of a pulpit for the sake of getting into the dicky i tell you we make some of them suffer
7023,6064-56165-0027.flac,a matter of opinion murmured belle under her breath you don't mean to say you haven't seen her cried brenda in surprise no i haven't happened to answered philip
7024,6064-56168-0003.flac,the girls were making up little groups to go to the game with youths of their acquaintance as escorts under the chaperonage of older people a few who had received no invitation were especially miserable and took no trouble to disguise their feelings
7025,6064-56168-0027.flac,when the tongues of half a dozen girls are vigorously discussing people and events of which the listener has not the slightest knowledge ruth herself was very independent
7026,6064-56168-0008.flac,except that you speak as if it were some one we might not care to have and if that's the case i declare it's too bad said belle if it's anything like that broke in brenda rather snappishly i will just tell edith what i think
7027,6064-56168-0033.flac,oh dear i can hardly wait for saturday i know it replied brenda it's less than a week too but it seems an awfully long time
7028,6064-56168-0012.flac,ruth roberts is as pleasant a girl as there is in school and yet she would have a terribly lonely time if it were not for edith and julia nobody else ever thinks of speaking to her well why should we
7029,6064-56168-0010.flac,you need not look so surprised rejoined nora and if you take my advice you will not see anything to edith she ought to have her own way in arranging her own party and you know when she makes up her mind it is of no use to talk to her about it
7030,6064-56168-0029.flac,had undertaken to prepare for college and it had been a great delight to her to have the latter placed with her in one or two special classes julia's liking for her had made edith take a little more interest in her than would otherwise have been the case
7031,6064-56168-0023.flac,ruth was a pretty and amiable girl about julia's age and therefore a little older than the four she had been in the school for two years before the coming of julia but in all that time she had had only a speaking acquaintance with the other girls
7032,6064-56168-0013.flac,yes that's what i think too nora smiled pleasantly and her eyes looked brighter than ever under the rim of her brown felt hat with its trimmings of lighter brown nora's temper was not easily ruffled
7033,6064-56168-0005.flac,and even occasionally from brenda both of whom were inclined to be more exclusive so it happened that the general harmony of the four was somewhat disturbed when nora one day at recess exclaimed who do you suppose is going with us to the game
7034,6064-56168-0031.flac,was so annoyed by belle's proposed championship of princeton that she was unexpectedly cordial to ruth and almost to her own surprise found herself urging ruth to come to town early on the saturday of the game to take luncheon with her and julia
7035,6064-56168-0007.flac,why who is it cried brenda and who is it echoed belle i know that you can't guess oh don't be silly nora it wouldn't be worth while to guess about something you'll know all about so soon
7036,6064-56168-0030.flac,no one who saw the hearty way in which nora and brenda greeted ruth as she came up with edith and julia could for a moment have imagined that she had been under discussion the mercurial brenda for the moment
7037,6064-56168-0018.flac,i am going to carry an orange scarf and perhaps an orange flag what for why i never heard of such a thing exclaimed nora nor i cried brenda at a harvard game
7038,6064-56168-0002.flac,and those who had relatives in the team were too proud for anything as brenda said the game was to be played in holmes field and tickets were not easy to get because the seats were far less numerous than now on the great soldiers field
7039,6064-56168-0015.flac,but i don't see turning rather snappishly towards brenda why the rest of us have got to take up ruth roberts just because your cousin julia is so devoted to her now this was a little too much even for brenda
7040,6064-56168-0006.flac,for of course in the minds of the others there could be but one game
7041,6064-56168-0032.flac,the latter expressed her thanks in a glance towards her cousin as ruth accepted very gracefully and nora exclaimed what fun we are going to have
7042,6064-56168-0014.flac,then belle added a final word oh it's clear that this is all julia's doings
7043,6064-56168-0020.flac,why it's a duty to do everything you can to help your own side i never said that harvard was my side interrupted belle didn't i tell you that i have a cousin on the princeton team you'd better not say anything of that kind to philip
7044,6064-56168-0022.flac,walking away from nora and brenda i do not need to be told what to do what nora or brenda might have answered i cannot say for hardly had belle disappeared within the house when edith herself appeared with julia and ruth
7045,6064-56168-0019.flac,i should call it very impolite if there were no orange flags shown at the game well you have the most ridiculous ideas hasn't she brenda brenda nodded assent and nora continued
7046,6064-56168-0016.flac,and anyway i'm thankful to have julia take a fancy to anybody it leaves us a great deal freer to do as we like i should think that you would see that yourself oh well said nora laughing the whole thing is not worth quarrelling about
7047,6064-56168-0025.flac,ruth lived in the suburbs and as bille had said outside of school the other girls seldom saw her at recess each little group had so many personal things to talk about that an outsider would have been decidedly in the way
7048,6064-56168-0017.flac,yes i know but still the least said the soonest mended said nora though to tell you the truth the quotation did not sound especially appropriate the least said the soonest mended
7049,6064-56168-0026.flac,and would perhaps have been a little uncomfortable in joining them no one gets a great deal of enjoyment from reading a single chapter in the middle of a book and so it is often hard to be a mere listener
7050,6064-56168-0021.flac,or to edith either they are both perfectly devoted to harvard and they expect their party to give great encouragement to the harvard team why belle i cannot imagine your doing anything else i'm not a child responded belle very crossly
7051,6064-56168-0028.flac,she had acquired the habit of studying during recess since after school she spent more time than most girls of her age in outdoor sports it did her no great harm to pass the half hour of recess in this way ruth as well as julia
7052,6064-56168-0000.flac,for a week before thanksgiving there was great excitement among the school girls on account of the approaching football game the four were as excited as the others although not so many of their own particular friends were in the harvard team
7053,6064-56168-0024.flac,that they were very selfish in leaving their schoolmate so entirely to herself it was not because they did not like her they were merely so very much wrapped up in their own affairs that they hardly noticed that she was often left to herself
7054,6064-56168-0001.flac,it was to be a game with princeton one of the great university matches and for special reasons there was the deepest interest in the match those girls who had brothers in college or even cousins or friends held themselves with more dignity than any of the others
7055,6064-56168-0011.flac,it's hard enough to have julia tagging about everywhere but why in the world we should have ruth roberts when we never see her anywhere except at school i really cannot understand and i don't see how you and nora can like it either why
7056,6064-56168-0009.flac,it that cried nora didn't i say that it was a person a girl if i must be more definite ruth roberts if i must tell just who it is oh cried belle and ah echoed brenda
7057,6064-56168-0004.flac,who had not been invited elsewhere to go in some other party now edith was of a generally generous disposition and not inclined to limit her favors of whatever nature to any particular set of girls
7058,6272-70191-0034.flac,it was the custom and father took his hat off to thank his friends for their sympathy and attention his lips moved but no words were audible the procession moved down the path again
7059,6272-70191-0033.flac,slanting backward and forward in protest against the folly of indicating what was no longer beneath them the mounds were covered with mats of scanty tangled grass and here and there a rank spot of green
7060,6272-70191-0036.flac,and not a soul was there when we went in the duties of friendship and tradition had been fulfilled the neighbors had gone home to their avocations for the public the tragedy was over all speculation on the degree of our grief
7061,6272-70191-0037.flac,or our indifference was settled we could take off our morning garments and our morning countenance now that we were alone or we could give way to that anguish we were afraid and ashamed to show except before the one
7062,6272-70191-0035.flac,arthur's hand was in mine he stamped his feet firmly on the sand as if to break the oppressive silence which no one seemed disposed to disturb the same ceremonies were performed in starting us homeward
7063,6272-70191-0019.flac,will the house be empty yes good i can walk through it once more the dead must be buried that is certain but why should it be certain that i must be the one to do it you think i can go through with it then
7064,6272-70191-0026.flac,that some considerate friend took him out and aunt merce wept so violently that she grew faint and caught hold of me i gave her the flashon of salts which revived her but i felt as father looked stern
7065,6272-70191-0002.flac,who were too distantly related to consider themselves as mourners to be shut up with us it was put under rigorous funeral law and inspected from garret to cellar they supervised all the arrangements
7066,6272-70191-0032.flac,we left the carriage at the palings and walked up the narrow path among the mounds where every stone was marked morgeson some so old that they were stained with blotches of yellow moss
7067,6272-70191-0005.flac,they reiterated the character the peculiarities the virtues of the mother i had lost who could never be replaced who was in a better world however i was in a measure
7068,6272-70191-0021.flac,i think we might kiss each other now she said i opened my arms holding her against my breast so tightly that she drew back but kissed my cheek gently and took from her pocket
7069,6272-70191-0001.flac,though i am sure the performers thereof had small encouragement veronica alone would see no one her room was the only one not invaded for the neighbors took the house into their hands assisted by that part of the morgesons
7070,6272-70191-0031.flac,and rode up a little hill where the sand was so deep that it muffled the wheels and feet of the horses the whole round of the gray sky was visible it hung low over us i wished it to drop and blot out the vague nothings under it
7071,6272-70191-0008.flac,which he had imparted to her of an arch it must be made of black marble with gold veins and ought to stand in egypt with the word pandemonium on it the kitchen was the focus of interest to him
7072,6272-70191-0004.flac,i endure the same annoyances over and over again from relays of people bedtime especially was there occasion i was not allowed to undress alone i must have drinks either to compose or stimulate
7073,6272-70191-0020.flac,i have set your behaviour down to your will you might be right perhaps mother was always right about me too she was against me she looked at me with a timidity and an apprehension that made my heart bleed
7074,6272-70191-0015.flac,is this like her she asked showing me a drawing how could you have done this because i have tried is it like yes the idea
7075,6272-70191-0003.flac,her course was taken for granted mine was imposed upon me i remonstrated with temperance but she replied that it was all well meant and always done
7076,6272-70191-0025.flac,they seemed to fall on the coffin in dull strife with its inmate who mutely contradicted them a discourse followed which was calculated to harrow the feelings to the utmost arthur began to cry so nervously
7077,6272-70191-0022.flac,a flascon of salts which he fastened to my belt by its little chain and said again go but recalling me said
7078,6272-70191-0013.flac,coming into my room dressed for the funeral no
7079,6272-70191-0007.flac,things would go well he said for everybody must expect to die then the bible says so he informed me also that he expected to be an architect and that mother liked it he had an idea
7080,6272-70191-0009.flac,for meals were prepared at all hours for comers and goers temperance told me that the mild and indifferent mourners were fond of good victuals and she thought their hearts were lighter than their stomachs when they went away
7081,6272-70191-0029.flac,at last the word was given and the long procession began to move through the street which was deserted a cat ran out of a house and scampered across the way arthur laughed and father jumped nervously at the sound of his laugh
7082,6272-70191-0023.flac,the landing stair was full of people i locked the door and took out the key the stairs were crowded all made way for me with a silent respect aunt murce when she saw me
7083,6272-70191-0016.flac,but what a picture she had attempted to make mother's shadowy face serenely looked from a high small window set in clouds like those which gather over the sun when it draws water
7084,6272-70191-0024.flac,put her hand on an empty chair beside father who sat by the coffin those passages in the bible which contained the beautifully poetic images relating to the going of man to his long home were read and to my ear
7085,6272-70191-0000.flac,we sat in state to be condoled with and waited upon
7086,6272-70191-0027.flac,and anxious to escape the unprofitable trial as the coffin was taken out to the hearse my heart twisted and palpitated as if a command had been laid upon it to follow and not leave her
7087,6272-70191-0028.flac,when the hearse moved down the street fathuer arthur and i were called and assisted in our own chaise as if we were helpless the reins were put in father's hands and the horse was led behind the hearse
7088,6272-70191-0006.flac,kept for myself during this interval the matter is often subservient to the manner arthur's feelings were played upon also he wept often confiding to me his grief and his plans for the future
7089,6272-70191-0018.flac,keep it but don't work on it any more and i put it away she was wan and languid but collected i see you are ready somebody must bury the dead go
7090,6272-70191-0030.flac,the graveyard was a mile outside the village a sandy plain where a few stunted pines transplanted from the woods near it struggled to keep alive as we turned from the street into the lane which led to it
7091,6272-70191-0010.flac,because he looked so grief struck aunt murce was engaged with a dressmaker and with the orders for bonnets and veils she discussed the subject of the morning with the morgesons i acquiesced in all her arrangements
7092,6272-70191-0011.flac,for she derived a simple comfort from these external tokens veronica refused to wear the bonnet and veil and the required bombozine bombozine made her flesh crawl why should she wear it mother hated it too
7093,6272-70191-0012.flac,for she had never worn out the garments made for grand'ther warren she is a bigger child than ever temperance remarked and must have her way
7094,6272-70191-0014.flac,the yard is full of carriages already somebody handed me gloves my bonnet was tied a handkerchief given to me and the door opened in the passage i heard a knocking from veronica's room and crossed to learn what she wanted
7095,6272-70191-0017.flac,it was closely pressed to the glass and she was regarding dark indefinite creatures below it
7096,6272-70168-0031.flac,though the fire had gone out the lamps winked brightly and father moving his cigar to the other side of his mouth changed his regards from one lamp to the other and said he thought i was growing to be an attractive girl
7097,6272-70168-0009.flac,did you experience any shadow of a change during the revival at barmouth no more than the baby here did i shall have faith though
7098,6272-70168-0022.flac,though the tall brass lamps glittered like gold their circle of light was small the corners of the room were obscure mister park entering retreated into one and mother was obliged to forego the pleasure of undressing arthur
7099,6272-70168-0017.flac,i grew blithe as i saw it winking under the rays of the afternoon sun and clapping my hands said i was glad to get home we left veronica at the table and mother resumed her conversation with me in a corner of the room
7100,6272-70168-0000.flac,instead of my heart leaping for joy as i had expected a sudden indifference filled it i felt averse to the change from the narrow ways of barmouth which for the moment i regretted
7101,6272-70168-0001.flac,when i entered the house and saw mother in her old place her surroundings unaltered i suffered a disappointment i had not had the power of transferring the atmosphere of my year's misery to surry
7102,6272-70168-0005.flac,the boy by name charles came to see the new arrival but smitten with diffidence crept under the table and examined me from his retreat
7103,6272-70168-0024.flac,as he shook hands with me i saw that his hair had whitened he held a tasselled cane between his knees and thumped the floor whenever he asked a question
7104,6272-70168-0021.flac,say so to my own child verry turned her face to the wall and said no more but she had started a less pleasant train of thought it was changed again by temperance coming with lights
7105,6272-70168-0023.flac,so she sent him off with temperance and charles whose duty it was to rock the cradle as long as his babyship required soon after father came and hepsy brought in his hot supper while he was eating it grandfather john morgeson bustled in
7106,6272-70168-0016.flac,she was too much engaged in conversation to fulfil her duties that way
7107,6272-70168-0006.flac,inquired mother he is getting his double teeth oh yes and where's veronica she's up garret writing geography and told me nothing in the world must disturb her till she had finished an account of the city of palmery
7108,6272-70168-0007.flac,said temperance call her when supper is ready replied mother who asked me to come into the bedroom where arthur was sleeping he was a handsome child large and fair and as i lifted his white lax fingers
7109,6272-70168-0004.flac,is it best to cook more missus morgeson
7110,6272-70168-0012.flac,temperance brought arthur to the table half asleep but he roused when she drummed on his plate with a spoon hepsey was stationed by the bannock knife in hand to serve it as we began our meal
7111,6272-70168-0028.flac,and turned towards mother as if he would like to say you understand bringing up children don't you she comprehended him and giving her head a slight toss told very to go and play on the piano i was going she answered pettishly
7112,6272-70168-0002.flac,i heard the wanton sound of the banging of doors the doors at grandther's i mused had list nailed round their edges but then he had the list being a tailor ovom said temperance with her hand on her hip
7113,6272-70168-0010.flac,because you have had the blessing of so good a man as your grand'ther but i never heard a word of grand'ther's prayers do you remember his voice
7114,6272-70168-0030.flac,joe bacon mother retired very still played her talent is wonderful said father taking the cigar from his mouth by the way you must take lessons in milford i wish you would learn to sing
7115,6272-70168-0003.flac,and not offering to approach me your hair is as thick as a mop hepsey rubbing her fingers against her thumb remarked that she hoped learning had not taken away my appetite
7116,6272-70168-0011.flac,my hearing him or not would make no difference since god could hear and answer grandther does not like me i never pleased him she looked astonished then reflective
7117,6272-70168-0020.flac,i feel evil still you know turning to me that my temper is worse than ever it is like a tiger's oh fairy said mother not quite so bad you are too hard upon yourself
7118,6272-70168-0025.flac,and mother listened with a vague respectful attention her hand was pressed against her breast as if she were repressing an inward voice which claimed her attention
7119,6272-70168-0013.flac,veronica came in from the kitchen with a plate of toasted crackers she set the plate down and gravely shook hands with me saying she had concluded to live entirely on toast but supposed i would eat all sorts of food as usual
7120,6272-70168-0034.flac,as i passed through the upper entry veronica opened her door she was undressed and had a little book in her hand which she shook at me saying
7121,6272-70168-0015.flac,and ate it in silence the plenty around me the ease and independence gave me a delightful sense of comfort the dishes were odd some of china some of delf and were continually moved out of their places for we helped ourselves
7122,6272-70168-0014.flac,her face was still long and narrow but prettier and her large dark eyes had a slight cast which gave her face an indescribable expression distant indifferent and speculative as the eyes were
7123,6272-70168-0019.flac,the glutton but he has not been here long they are all so when they first come she then gave him a large slice of the cake veronica contrary to her wont
7124,6272-70168-0029.flac,and darted out a moment after we heard her grandfather went and presently mister park got up in a lingering way
7125,6272-70168-0018.flac,presently temperance came in with charles bringing fresh plates as soon as they began their supper veronic asked temperance how the fish tasted is it salt middling how is the bannock excellent
7126,6272-70168-0026.flac,her hair dropped on her shoulder and looked like a brown coiled serpent veronica who had been silently observing her rose from the sofa picked up the comb and fastened her hair without speaking as she passed she gave me a dark look
7127,6272-70168-0008.flac,a torrent of love swept through me and i kissed him i am afraid i make an idle of him cassi are you unhappy because you love him so well mother and feel that you must make expiation cassandra she spoke with haste
7128,6272-70168-0032.flac,a very strong relation of reserve generally existed between parent and child instead of a confidential one and the child was apt to discover that reserve on the part of the parent was not superiority but cowardice or indifference
7129,6272-70168-0033.flac,let it not be so with us was his conclusion he threw away the stump of his cigar and went to fasten the hall door i took one of the brass lamps proposing to go to bed
7130,6272-70168-0027.flac,eh very said father are you there were you glad to see cassy home again should i be glad what can she do grandfather pursed up his mouth
7131,6272-70171-0003.flac,rosville was larger and handsomer than surrey that is my house on the right he said we looked down the shady street through which we were going
7132,6272-70171-0037.flac,telling him it was the likeness of her cousin rachel's husband i replied we knew that grandfather had married a rachel summers cousin charles was surprised and a little vexed that the doctor had never told him
7133,6272-70171-0034.flac,leaping so high that the harnessed seemed rattling from their backs he struck them and said go on now go on devils there was no further trouble he encouraged mother not to be afraid looking keenly at me
7134,6272-70171-0035.flac,and the scholars some sixty boys and girls were coming downstairs from the hall to go into the rooms each side of a great door doctor price was behind them he stopped when he saw us an introduction took place and he inquired for doctor snell
7135,6272-70171-0033.flac,and for the first time i saw his father smile on him these are fine brutes he said not taking his eyes from them but they are not equal to my mare nell alice is afraid of her but i hope that you cassandra
7136,6272-70171-0030.flac,she was always making up some nice dish tell her i remember it will you when cousin charles put us into the carriage and hoisted little edward on the front seat mother noticed that two men held the horses and that they were not the same he had driven the night before
7137,6272-70171-0017.flac,putting others of a plainer make in their places shook down the window curtains asked us if we would have anything more and quietly disappeared i offered mother the warm water and appropriated the biscuits there were six i ate every one
7138,6272-70171-0006.flac,we were hardly seated when we heard a cry of a young child she left the table hastily to come back in a moment with an apology which she made to cousin charles rather than to us i had never seen a table so well arranged
7139,6272-70171-0008.flac,the lamp chops were fragile the bread was delicious but cut in transparent slices and the butter pat was nearly stamped through with its bouquet of flowers this was all the feast except sponge cake which felt like muslin in the fingers
7140,6272-70171-0032.flac,that stood on their hind legs as often as that position was compatible with the necessity they were under of getting on for they evidently understood that they were guided by a firm hand edward was delighted with their behavior
7141,6272-70171-0023.flac,and their mother was tending and watching them the oldest was eight years the youngest three months cousin alice gave us descriptions of their tastes and habits dwelling with emphasis on those of the baby
7142,6272-70171-0015.flac,she could appreciate her anxiety and sadness in leaving me mother thanked her warmly and was sure that i should be happy but i had an inward misgiving that i should not have enough to eat i hear edward said alice good night
7143,6272-70171-0001.flac,i looked out on a tranquil agreeable landscape there was nothing celine in the atmosphere the western breeze which flew in our faces had an earthy scent with fluctuating streams of odors from trees and flowers
7144,6272-70171-0041.flac,and that there was no congregational church in rosville she went to boston that friday afternoon anxious to get safely home with veronica we parted with many a kiss and shake of the hand and last words
7145,6272-70171-0012.flac,the furniture was dark the mantle and table tops were black marble and the vases and candelabra were bronze he directed mother's attention to the portraits of his children explaining them
7146,6272-70171-0019.flac,i think they would grumble and admire look at this showing her the tassels of the inner window curtains done up in little bags and the glass is pinned up with nice yellow paper
7147,6272-70171-0005.flac,as mister morgeson introduced her giving us a cordial welcome she led us into a parlour where tea was waiting a servant came in for our bonnets and baskets cousin alice begged us to take tea at once
7148,6272-70171-0014.flac,we should see her three children she never left them she was so afraid of their being ill also telling mother that she would do all in her power to make my stay in rosville pleasant and profitable as a mother
7149,6272-70171-0018.flac,undressing meanwhile and surveying the apartment cassy missus morgeson is an excellent housekeeper yes i said huskily for the dry biscuit choked me what would temperance and hepsy say to this
7150,6272-70171-0009.flac,i could have squeezed the whole of it into my mouth still hungry i observed that cousin charles and alice had finished and though she shook her spoon in the cup feigning to continue and he snipped crumbs in his plate
7151,6272-70171-0004.flac,and a peaked roof and on the side towards us a large yard and stables we drove into the yard and a woman came out on the piazza to receive us it was missus morgeson or my wife cousin alice
7152,6272-70171-0040.flac,think how much greater your advantages are than mine have ever been how miserable was my youth it is too late for me to make any attempt at cultivation i have no wish that way
7153,6272-70171-0027.flac,the ham was most savory but cut in such thin slices that it curled and the biscuits were as white and feathery as snowflakes
7154,6272-70171-0025.flac,put little edward in his chair and breakfast began missus morgeson said charles the horses will be ready to take you round rosville we will call on doctor price for you to see the kind of master cassandra will have i have already spoken to him about receiving a new pupil
7155,6272-70171-0024.flac,i drew from her conversation the opinion that she had a tendency to the rearing of children i was glad when cousin charles came in looking at his watch send off the babies alice and ring the bell for breakfast she sent out the two youngest
7156,6272-70171-0031.flac,she said she was afraid to go they looked ungovernable but he reassured her and one of the men averring that mister morgeson could drive anything she repressed her fears and we drove out of the yard behind a pair of horses
7157,6272-70171-0007.flac,so fastidiously neat it glittered with glass and french china cousin charles sent away a glass and a plate frowning at the girl who waited there must have been a speck or a flaw in them the viands were as pretty as the dishes
7158,6272-70171-0021.flac,it was byron and turning over the leaves till i came to don juan i read it through
7159,6272-70171-0002.flac,as we passed through the town cousin charles pointed to the academy which stood at the head of a green pretty houses stood round it and streets branched from it in all directions flower gardens shrubbery and trees were scattered everywhere
7160,6272-70171-0028.flac,cousin alice gave unremitting attention to edward who ate as little as the rest mother i said afterward
7161,6272-70171-0016.flac,presently a girl the same who had taken our bonnets came in with a pitcher of warm water and a plate of soda biscuit she directed us where to find the apparel she had nicely smoothed and folded took off the handsome counterpane and the pillows trimmed with lace
7162,6272-70171-0013.flac,dark and delicate but to look at it made me shiver mother came towards us pleading fatigue is an excuse for retiring and cousin charles called cousin alice who went with us to our room in the morning she said
7163,6272-70171-0020.flac,and here is a damask napkin fastened to the wall behind the washstand and everything stands on a mat i wonder if this is to be my room it is probably the chamber for visitors why
7164,6272-70171-0022.flac,which was not the one we had taken tea in but a small apartment with a door opening into the garden
7165,6272-70171-0029.flac,i noticed how elegant their table appointments were and i shall buy new china in boston to morrow i wish hepsey would not load our table as she does hepsey is a good woman mother do give my love to her now that i think of it
7166,6272-70171-0010.flac,i felt constrained to end my repast he rose then and pushing back the folding doors we entered a large room leaving alice at the table windows extending to the floor opening on the piazza
7167,6272-70171-0026.flac,i said mother tried in vain to look hard hearted and to persuade that it was good for me but she lost her appetite with the thought of losing me which the mention of doctor price brought home
7168,6272-70171-0036.flac,as an old college friend loc morgeson sounded familiarly he said a member of his mother's family named somers had married a gentleman of that name he remembered it from an old ivory miniature which his mother had shown him
7169,6272-70171-0039.flac,that i frankly told her i was eighteen years old very ignorant and averse from learning but i did not speak loud enough for anybody beside herself to hear now said mother when we came away
7170,6272-70171-0000.flac,chapter fourteen it was sunset when we arrived in rosville and found mister morgeson waiting for us with his carriage at the station from its open sides
7171,6272-70171-0038.flac,and we followed him to her schoolroom i was at once interested and impressed by the appearance of my teacher that was to be she was a dignified kind looking woman who asked me a few questions in such a pleasant direct manner
7172,6272-70171-0011.flac,but notwithstanding the stream of light over the carpet i thought it sombre and out of keeping with the cottage exterior
7173,8465-246942-0010.flac,that would have no divisions of pride no scatterings of hate
7174,8465-246942-0001.flac,her polde on the scaffold god in heaven infinitely rather would she poison herself and him then she remembered how pleased and consoled he had been when she said something about their dying together and that reassured her a little
7175,8465-246942-0011.flac,which she might have carried home in gladness to her sick souled brother to comfort and strengthen him
7176,8465-246942-0014.flac,skeletons they were and no human beings at all her father
7177,8465-246942-0005.flac,then indeed if there be no god or one that has not an infinite power of setting right that which has gone wrong with his work then indeed welcome the faith for faith it may then be called of such as say there is no hereafter
7178,8465-246942-0026.flac,helen was on her knees with her head on a chair yet once more crying to the hearer of cries possible or impossible being she knew not in the least but words reported of him had given birth to the cry to help her in her dire need
7179,8465-246942-0002.flac,but she must take care that foolish extravagant curate should not come near him there was no knowing to what he might persuade him poor poldie was so easily led by any show of nobility anything that looked grand or self sacrificing
7180,8465-246942-0007.flac,and some kind of refuge there does seem to be strange it is and true that in publicity itself lies some relief from the gnawing of the worm as if even a cursing humanity were a barrier of protection between the torn soul and its crime
7181,8465-246942-0018.flac,and therefore could not know the frightful consequences of such a confession as he had counselled had she not better then tell him all and so gather from him some right and reasonable advice for the soothing of the agonies of her poor broken winged angel
7182,8465-246942-0016.flac,and was he to go and confess it and be tried for it and be great god and here was the priest actually counselling what was worse than any suicide
7183,8465-246942-0004.flac,agonies of injury a man may endure and so far from being overwhelmed rise above them tenfold a man who were he to awake to the self knowledge of a crime would sink into a heap of ruin
7184,8465-246942-0003.flac,helen's only knowledge of guilt came from the pale image of it lifted above her horizon by the refraction of her sympathy she did not know perhaps never would understand the ghastly horror of conscious guilt besides which there is no evil else
7185,8465-246942-0013.flac,he had only spoken drearily of duty hinting at a horror that would plunge the whole ancient family into a hell of dishonor and contempt
7186,8465-246942-0027.flac,instead of any word or thought even coming to her that might be fancied an answer she was scared from her knees by an approaching step
7187,8465-246942-0006.flac,helen did not know to what gulfs of personal shame nay to what summits of public execration a man may be glad to flee for refuge from the fangs of home born guilt if so be there is any refuge to be found in either
7188,8465-246942-0000.flac,she had sought the door of paradise and the door of hell had been opened to her if the frightful idea which she did not doubt had already suggested itself to leopold should now be encouraged there was nothing but black madness before her
7189,8465-246942-0019.flac,but alas what security had she that a man capable of such priestly severity and heartlessness
7190,8465-246942-0017.flac,suddenly however it occurred to her that the curate had had no knowledge of the facts of the case and had therefore been compelled to talk at random it was impossible he should suspect the crime of which her brother had been guilty
7191,8465-246942-0008.flac,it flees to its kind for shelter from itself hence i imagine in part may the coolness of some criminals be accounted for their quietness is the relief brought by confession even confession but to their fellows
7192,8465-246942-0015.flac,if leopold had had her mother for his two instead of the dark skinned woman with the flashing eyes he would never have brought this upon them it was all his mother's fault the fault of her race and of the horrible drug her people had taught him to take
7193,8465-246942-0022.flac,and then serve her as the curate had done yot was indeed shameless he would never have treated a poor wretched woman like that and as she said thus to herself again the words sounded in the ear of her heart
7194,8465-246942-0024.flac,keeps for his own in every house that he builds alas so long in most human houses shut away from the rest of the rooms and forgotten or recollected with uneasiness as a lumbr closet in which lie too many things that had better not be looked into
7195,8465-246942-0023.flac,come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest whence came the voice from her memory or from that inner chamber of the spirit which the one spirit bearing spirit
7196,8465-246942-0012.flac,and make him feel that after all there was yet a place for him in the universe and that he was no outcast of gahenna but instead of such words of gentle might like those of the man of whom he was so fond of talking
7197,8465-246942-0020.flac,no she would venture no further sooner would she go to george bascombe from whom she not only could look for no spiritual comfort but whose theories were so cruel against culprits of all sorts
7198,8465-246942-0009.flac,is it that the crime seems then lifted a little from their shoulders and its weight shared by the ace helen had hoped that the man who had spoken in public so tenderly and at the same time so powerfully of the saving heart of the universe
7199,8465-246942-0025.flac,but what matter were the voice that had said them so long as the words were true and she might believe them whatever is true can be believed of the true heart ere she knew
7200,8465-246942-0021.flac,alas alas she was alone absolutely alone in the great waste death eyed universe but for a man to talk so of the tenderness of jesus christ
7201,8465-246943-0018.flac,yet she hesitated not a single moment in her administrations there is so much passes in us of which our consciousness takes no grasp or but with such a flitting touch as scarcely to hand it over to the memory
7202,8465-246943-0024.flac,i will soon satisfy you it could be no fancy here he pushed her from him and looked straight in her eyes i saw her back reflected in the mirror of the wardrobe door and
7203,8465-246943-0022.flac,nonsense dear poldie it was all fancy nothing more she returned in a voice almost as hollow as his and the lightness of the words uttered in such a tone jarred dismayfully on her own ear fancy he repeated
7204,8465-246943-0003.flac,what was that poldie asked helen with a pang of fear why those words of course what else you sang them to me afterwards you know helen
7205,8465-246943-0027.flac,if indeed that be a possible source of courage and it is not gathered rather from the hidden hope of which i speak and the love that will cleave and not forsake she set her teeth and said let her come then poldie i'm with you and i defy her
7206,8465-246943-0002.flac,but at the same time he appeared more wasted and pinched and deathlike than she had yet seen him or was it only in her eyes was she but reading in his face the agony she had herself gone through that day helen helen he cried as she entered the room
7207,8465-246943-0007.flac,oh i wish i hadn't run away but had let them take me and hang me helen felt herself grow white she turned away and pretended to search for something she had dropped
7208,8465-246943-0013.flac,indeed was she not certain that such a man bringing the artillery of his fanaticism to bear upon her poor boy's wild enthusiastic temperament would speedily persuade him to make a reality of that terrible thing he had already thought of that hideously impossible possibility
7209,8465-246943-0019.flac,that i feel encouraged to doubt whether ever there was a man absolutely without hope that there have been alas are many who are aware of no ground of hope nay even who feel no glimmer in them of anything they can call hope i know
7210,8465-246943-0010.flac,what is he there for then said leopold indignantly and turned his face to the wall and moaned helen had not yet thought of asking herself whether her love to her brother was all clear love and nowise mingled with selfishness
7211,8465-246943-0017.flac,if the cruel power that had created him for such misery whoever whatever wherever he might be
7212,8465-246943-0023.flac,i know what fancy is as well as any man or woman born that was no fancy she stood there by the wardrobe in the same dress her face as white as her dress and listen i will tell you
7213,8465-246943-0026.flac,ogh i saw it in the mirror his voice had risen to a strangled shriek his face was distorted
7214,8465-246943-0014.flac,it could not have been long she thought
7215,8465-246943-0016.flac,but in all she did for him she felt like the executioner who gives restoratives to the wretch that has fainted on the rack or the wheel what right had she she thought to multiply to him his moments of torture
7216,8465-246943-0025.flac,here the fixed look of horror threatened to return upon his face but he went on listen
7217,8465-246943-0008.flac,i don't think he would be of the slightest use to you she said still stooping and she felt like a devil dragging the soul of her brother to hell but that was a foolish fancy and must be resisted
7218,8465-246943-0029.flac,but leopold seemed not to hear a word she said and lay with his face to the wall
7219,8465-246943-0005.flac,was this what came of praying she thought bitterly something or other i don't know what exactly returned leopold oh helen he broke out with a cry stifled by the caution that had grown habitual to both of them
7220,8465-246943-0021.flac,at length leopold opened his eyes
7221,8465-246943-0011.flac,whether in the fresh horror that day poured into the cup that had seemed already running over it was of her brother only she thought or whether threatened shame to herself had not a part in her misery
7222,8465-246943-0004.flac,don't you think he might be able to do something
7223,8465-246943-0009.flac,not if i told him everything leopold hissed from between his teeth in the struggle to keep down a shriek no not if you told him everything she answered and felt like a judge condemning him to death
7224,8465-246943-0001.flac,that glimmer on his countenance doubtful as the first of the morning when the traveller knows not whether the light be in the sky or only in his brain
7225,8465-246943-0000.flac,helen rose and hastened to her brother with a heart of lead in her body she started when she saw him some change had passed on him since the morning
7226,8465-246943-0028.flac,she shall know that a sister's love is stronger than the hate of a jilt even if you did kill her before god poldie i would after all rather be you than she say what you will
7227,8465-246943-0006.flac,is there no help of any kind anywhere surely mister wingfold could tell me something comfort me somehow if i were to tell him all about it i could trust the man that said such things as those you told me that i could
7228,8465-246943-0015.flac,apparently senseless on the pillow and she thought he was dead the same moment she was free the horror had departed from her own atmosphere too and she made haste to restore him
7229,8465-246943-0020.flac,but i think in them all is an underlying unconscious hope i think that not one in all the world has more than a shadowy notion of what hopelessness means perhaps utter hopelessness is the outer darkness
7230,8465-246943-0012.flac,for what attempt even had he made to comfort her what had he done but utter common places and truisms about duty and who could tell but
7231,8465-246940-0028.flac,ever since leopold said the word jury a ghastly fear had haunted helen she pressed her hand on her heart and made no answer i speak from experience the curate went on from what else could i speak
7232,8465-246940-0021.flac,therefore surely the first step for any one who has committed such a crime must be to humble himself before god confess the sin and ask forgiveness and cleansing
7233,8465-246940-0001.flac,can you tell me she said from behind more veils than that of lace how to get rid of a haunting idea that depends on the nature of the idea i should imagine answered the curate such things sometimes arise merely from the state of the health
7234,8465-246940-0027.flac,that the person of whom you speak is not neglecting something he ought to do something he knows perhaps he had come back to the same with which he started through her veil he saw her turn deadly white
7235,8465-246940-0008.flac,might it not be well however to try if there is any to be had from him that said come unto me and i will give you rest i can do nothing with that i have tried and tried to pray but it is of no use
7236,8465-246940-0023.flac,then you think confession to god is all that is required if there be no one else wrong to whom confession can be made if the case were mine
7237,8465-246940-0015.flac,but what appeared to the curate a long silence followed at length she said with faltering voice suppose it were a great wrong that had been done and that was the unendurable thought suppose i say
7238,8465-246940-0026.flac,she had gone much farther than she had intended but the more doubtful help became the more she was driven by the agony of a perishing hope to search the heart of wingfold again the curate pondered are you sure he said at length
7239,8465-246940-0018.flac,again the curate took time to reply i am endeavoring to answer your questions as well as i can he said but it is hard to deal with generalities
7240,8465-246940-0014.flac,possibly there is something you ought to do and are not doing and that is why you cannot rest i think jesus would give no rest except in the way of learning of him helen's sobs ceased
7241,8465-246940-0024.flac,and sometimes i much fear that in taking holy orders i have grievously sinned i should then do just as i have done with regard to that cry to the living power which i think originated me to set the matter right for me
7242,8465-246940-0006.flac,i may be able to hint at some hope said wingfold very gently do you call yourself a christian the question would to most people have sounded strange abrupt inquisitorial but to helen it sounded not one of them all
7243,8465-246940-0019.flac,you see how useless for that very reason my answers have as yet been still i have something more to say and hesitate only because it may imply more confidence than i dare profess and of all things i dread untruth
7244,8465-246940-0007.flac,no she answered ah said the curate a little sadly and went on because then i could have said you know where to go for comfort
7245,8465-246940-0029.flac,i know that so long as we hang back from doing what conscience urges there is no peace for us i will not say our prayers are not heard for mister polwarth has taught me that the most precious answer prayer can have
7246,8465-246940-0013.flac,his help may be on the way to you or even with you only you do not recognize it for what it is i have known that kind of thing tell me some fact or some feeling i can lay hold of
7247,8465-246940-0005.flac,then give me some food some hope i mean and try me again without that i don't care about duty or life or anything tell me then what is the matter
7248,8465-246940-0022.flac,and the creature he has made and if god heard the man's prayer and forgave him then the man would certainly know it in his heart and be consoled perhaps by the gift of humility
7249,8465-246940-0017.flac,here the answer was not so plain and the curate had to think at least he said at length you could confess the wrong and ask forgiveness
7250,8465-246940-0004.flac,you wouldn't talk about work to a man dying of hunger would you i'm not sure about that he wouldn't heed you perhaps not what would you do then give him some food and try him again i think
7251,8465-246940-0000.flac,it was some moments before either of them spoke and it did not help wingfold that she sat clouded by a dark colored veil at length he said you must not fear to trust me because i doubt my ability to help you i can at least assure you of my sympathy
7252,8465-246940-0009.flac,i suppose it is because i cannot believe there is any one hearing a word i say yesterday when i got alone in the park i prayed aloud
7253,8465-246940-0030.flac,lies in the growing strength of the impulse toward the dreaded duty and in the ever sharper stings of the conscience i think i asked already whether there were no relatives to whom reparation could be made yes yes gasped helen
7254,8465-246940-0011.flac,she tried hard but could not prevent a sob
7255,8465-246940-0012.flac,will you not tell me something about it said the curate yet more gently
7256,8465-246940-0002.flac,and there the doctor is the best help helen shook her head and smiled behind her veil a grievous smile the curate paused but receiving no assistance ventured on again if it be a thought of something past and gone
7257,8465-246940-0020.flac,for surely there cannot be any other kind of god than the father of jesus christ
7258,8465-246940-0010.flac,i thought that perhaps even if he might not be able to read what was in my heart he might be able to hear my voice i was even foolish enough to wish i knew greek because perhaps he would understand me better if i were to pray in greek
7259,8465-246940-0003.flac,for which nothing can be done i think activity in one's daily work must be the best aid to endurance oh dear oh dear sighed helen when one has no heart to endure and hates the very sunlight
7260,8465-246940-0025.flac,then to forgive and console me alas alas that he will not hear of he would rather be punished than consoled i fear for his brain but indeed that might be well
7261,8465-246940-0016.flac,that was what made me miserable then you must of course make all possible reparation answered wingfold at once but if none were possible what then
7262,8465-246940-0031.flac,an i told ye your reparation was impossible her voice had sunk almost to a groan
7263,8465-246947-0027.flac,and another comes diving after him it isn't for me to say how he is to take hold of me no helen when i trust i trust out and out helen sighed thinking how ill that had worked with emmeline
7264,8465-246947-0011.flac,her love and her conscience were not yet at one with each other they parted at the door from the garden and she returned to the sick room she paused hesitating to enter all was still as the grave she turned the handle softly and peeped in
7265,8465-246947-0024.flac,he hasn't got a secret like us helen he added sadly what did he say to you much what he said to you from the pulpit the other day i should think then she was right for all his hardness and want of sympathy the curate had yet had regard to her entreaties
7266,8465-246947-0004.flac,and walked with him through the garden wingfold did not speak you don't think very badly of my poor brother do you mister wingfold said helen meekly it is a terrible fate he returned
7267,8465-246947-0018.flac,had the curate been a man she liked she would not perhaps have minded it so much you will be able to do without me now she said sadly i never could understand taking to people at first sight some people are made so i suppose helen
7268,8465-246947-0009.flac,the dwarf exclaimed helen shuddering at the remembrance of what she had gone through at the cottage yes that man's soul is as grand and beautiful and patient as his body is insignificant and distorted and troubled
7269,8465-246947-0005.flac,i think i never saw a lovelier disposition i do hope his mind will soon be more composed i think he knows where alone he can find rest i am well aware how foolish that of which i speak seems to some minds miss lingard
7270,8465-246947-0020.flac,i know that could never have been you ran to meet me and took me in your arms and kissed me i was as if i had crossed the sea of death and found paradise in your bosom i am not likely to forget you for mister wingfold
7271,8465-246947-0014.flac,was it rudimentary thankfulness to the father of her spirit as she stood gazing with the look of a mother over her sick child he lifted his eyelids and smiled a sad smile when did you come into the room he said a minute ago she answered
7272,8465-246947-0025.flac,and was not going to put any horrid notions about duty and self sacrifice into the poor boy's head he's coming again to morrow added leopold almost gleefully and then perhaps he will tell me more and help me on a bit did he tell you he wants to bring a friend with him
7273,8465-246947-0010.flac,he is the wisest and best man i have ever known i must ask leopold returned helen who the better the man was represented felt the more jealous and fearful of the advice he might give
7274,8465-246947-0013.flac,she stepped quickly in and round the screen to the side of the bed there to her glad surprise he lay fast asleep with the tears not yet dried upon his face her heart swelled with some sense unknown before
7275,8465-246947-0006.flac,but when a man is once overwhelmed in his own deeds when they have turned into spectres to mock at him when he loathes himself and turns with sickness from past present and future i know but one choice left
7276,8465-246947-0015.flac,i did not hear you he returned no you were asleep not i mister wingfold is only just gone i have let him out on the meadow since leopold stared looked half alarmed and then said
7277,8465-246947-0023.flac,you know all about him though you never saw him before that is true returned leopold but then he came to me with his door open and let me walk in
7278,8465-246947-0012.flac,could it be that wingfold's bearing had communicated to her mind a shadow of the awe with which he had left the place where perhaps a soul was being borne again leopold did not move terror laid hold of her heart
7279,8465-246947-0026.flac,no i can't see the good of taking more people into our confidence why should he not do what he thinks best helen you don't interfere with the doctor why should you with him when a man is going to the bottom as fast as he can
7280,8465-246947-0003.flac,he was not aware that the tears stood in his eyes but helen saw them you know all she faltered i do will you let me out by the garden again i wish to be alone she led the way down the stair
7281,8465-246947-0017.flac,that is a good fellow such a good fellow a pang of jealousy the first she had ever felt shot to her heart she had hitherto since his trouble been all in all to her leopold
7282,8465-246947-0021.flac,good and kind and strong as he is even she could not make me forget you helen but neither you nor i can do without mister wingfold any more i fancy i wish you liked him better
7283,8465-246947-0016.flac,did god make me sleep helen she did not answer the light of a new hope in his eye as if the dawn had begun at last to break over the dark mountains was already reflected from her heart oh helen he said
7284,8465-246947-0022.flac,but you will in time you see he's not one to pay young ladies compliments as i have heard some parsons do and he may be a little no not unpolished not that that's not what i mean but unornamental in his manners
7285,8465-246947-0000.flac,as wingfold came out of the room which was near the stair helen rose from the top of it where she had been sitting all the time he had been in with her brother he closed the door gently behind him and stepped softly along the landing
7286,8465-246947-0002.flac,but at his head stood one who watched his throes with the throbs of such a human heart as never beat in any bosom but his own and the executioners were angels of light no wonder if with such a feeling in his breast wingfold walked softly and his face glistened
7287,8465-246947-0001.flac,a human soul in guilt and agony is an awful presence but there was more than that in the hush of the curate he felt as if he had left the physician of souls behind him at the bedside
7288,8465-246947-0008.flac,the terror of his possible counsel for the moment vanished he could never tell him to give himself up
7289,8465-246947-0019.flac,i know i took to you at first sight i shall never forget the first time i saw you when i came to this country a lonely little foreigner and you a great beautiful lady for such you seemed to me though you have told me since you were only a great gauky girl
7290,8465-246947-0007.flac,into the life i hope your brother will enter i am so glad you don't hate him hate him who but a demon could hate him helen lifted a grateful look from eyes that swam in tears
7291,8063-274117-0031.flac,i must and will learn who that woman is said the musketeer again and then without further deliberation he set off in pursuit of her as he was going alone he tried to think how he could possibly contrive to make her raise her veil she is not young he said
7292,8063-274117-0019.flac,no no one seems to be following the coffin yes said porthos i see a man
7293,8063-274117-0035.flac,a poor franciscan mendicom friar replied the latter who had not even a dog to love him in this world and to accompany him to his last resting place if that were really the case thought d'artagnan
7294,8063-274117-0032.flac,and as a woman of high rank in society i ought to know that figure and peculiar style of walk as he ran the sound of his spurs and of his boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange jingling noise a fortunate circumstance in itself
7295,8063-274117-0029.flac,either by way of attack or defence that they must be conversing about any other subject than of love at the end of the conversation the lady rose and bowed profoundly to aramis
7296,8063-274117-0034.flac,he murmured madame de chevruse d'artagnan would not go home until he had learnt everything
7297,8063-274117-0016.flac,monsieur said planchet i am one of those good humored sort of men whom heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days
7298,8063-274117-0024.flac,leave me leave me i feel i am beginning already to be much comforted by my meditations so do not interrupt me
7299,8063-274117-0033.flac,which he was far from reckoning upon the noise disturbed the lady she seemed to fancy she was being either followed or pursued which is indeed the case and turned round
7300,8063-274117-0022.flac,what said porthos to d'artagnan as he turned round are you going to remain here yes i will join you presently
7301,8063-274117-0028.flac,yes he added after a pause
7302,8063-274117-0025.flac,the two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which they carried the litter and were letting their burden glide gently into the open grave
7303,8063-274117-0030.flac,the cavalier kneels at the beginning the young lady by and by gets tamed down and then it is she who has to supplicate who is this lady i would give anything to ascertain it seemed impossible however for aramis was the first to leave
7304,8063-274117-0021.flac,it is exactly my own case i was so melancholy at first that i could do nothing but make the sign of the cross all day and the chants were like so many nails being driven into my head but now they lull me to sleep
7305,8063-274117-0015.flac,why i feel it does me good to contemplate a few dead upon my word said d'artagnan
7306,8063-274117-0026.flac,the grave having been filled up the priests turned away and the grave digger having addressed a few words to them followed them as they moved away
7307,8063-274117-0020.flac,i find it interesting said d'artagnan leaning on the window sill
7308,8063-274117-0023.flac,not yet ah yes the grave digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round the bier but
7309,8063-274117-0017.flac,we are going to have a representation now for i think i heard something like chanting yes said d'artagnan i hear singing too
7310,8063-274117-0014.flac,and who have to listen to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day and to the soulless tramp tramp tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand foot passengers but living said porthos living remember that
7311,8063-274117-0027.flac,it is aramis himself aramis in fact remained alone on that side at least for hardly had he turned his head when a woman's footsteps and the rustling of her dress were heard on the path close to him he immediately turned around
7312,8063-274117-0018.flac,the officiating priest the beadle
7313,8063-274117-0011.flac,i assure you it is very curious hardly a day passes that someone is not buried there for fontainebleau is by no means an inconsiderable place sometimes we see young girls clothed in white carrying banners
7314,8063-274117-0007.flac,i have had four avenues laid out and at the end of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the others
7315,8063-274117-0005.flac,took both his friends by the hand i am going to show you over the house he said
7316,8063-274117-0002.flac,and his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet
7317,8063-274117-0008.flac,and he led his two guests to a window ah said d'artagnan this is the rue de leon yes i have two windows on this side a paltry insignificant view
7318,8063-274117-0010.flac,it is the horizon a thick line of green which is yellow in the spring green in the summer red in the autumn and white in the winter
7319,8063-274117-0013.flac,if i had any i should be far from rejecting them said planchet but possessing only this little cemetery full of flowers so moss grown shady and quiet i am contented with it and i think of those who live in town on the rue des lombardes for instance
7320,8063-274117-0006.flac,i am a great stickler for a good view myself said porthos
7321,8063-274117-0004.flac,brisk and lively as ever held out his hand to planchet's and d'artagnan requested permission to embrace madame truchen the latter to show that she bore no ill will approached porthos upon whom she conferred the same favor
7322,8063-274117-0009.flac,for there was always that bustling and noisy inn which is a very disagreeable neighbor i had four windows here but i bricked up too let us go on said d'artagnan
7323,8063-274117-0001.flac,he took by assault porthos's room which was next to his own the worthy porthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder in the dim obscurity of the room his gigantic frame was preominently displayed
7324,8063-274117-0012.flac,and then too we see some of the officers of the king's household i should not like that said porthos there is not much amusement in it at all events said d'artagnan
7325,8063-274117-0000.flac,like a kind good housekeeper it was still perfectly dark then
7326,8063-274117-0003.flac,the whole household was already up the cook was mercilessly slaughtering in the poultry yard selestine was gathering white cherries in the garden porthos
7327,8063-274116-0021.flac,frankly conceided d'artagnan complimented planchet and said you are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable life monsieur said planchet laughing is capital which a man ought to invest as sensibly as he possibly can
7328,8063-274116-0012.flac,whether upon a piece of old china or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness or upon the weapons hanging against the wall the soft light was softly reflected and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or another agreeable to the eye the lamp which lighted the room
7329,8063-274116-0024.flac,you should not call her madame said d'artagnan why not asked planchet because it would make her seem older every time you call her so well
7330,8063-274116-0029.flac,a meal into a regular feast fresh butter salt beef anchovies trouni a shopful of planchet's commodities fowls vegetables salade fish from the pond and the river game from the forest all the produce in fact of the province
7331,8063-274116-0035.flac,while the two wine bibers
7332,8063-274116-0008.flac,and dressed in an old stable suit of clothes the peasant
7333,8063-274116-0032.flac,d'artagnan still preserved his dignity and self possession but porthos had lost a portion of his and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious d'artagnan
7334,8063-274116-0033.flac,recommended a new descent into the cellar and as planchet no longer walked with the steadiness of a well trained foot soldier
7335,8063-274116-0037.flac,d'artagnan whom nothing ever escaped remarked how much redder trouchen's left cheek was than her right
7336,8063-274116-0038.flac,and truchen was looking at him with a most bewitching smile the sparkling wite of anjou very soon produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions
7337,8063-274116-0020.flac,and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in question not however
7338,8063-274116-0030.flac,the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of dust which covered them porthos's heart began to expand as he said i am hungry and he sat himself beside madame truchen whom he looked at in the most killing manner
7339,8063-274116-0039.flac,after his friend had undressed him d'artagnan got into his own bed saying to himself mordioux
7340,8063-274116-0036.flac,porthos fancies himself at la rochelle thought d'artagnan as they returned freighted with bottles
7341,8063-274116-0016.flac,at the sound of his gigantic voice the cat took flight
7342,8063-274116-0027.flac,she placed her two thousand florins in my establishment
7343,8063-274116-0005.flac,pierfond i have only one cow planchet hastened to say modestly and i have thirty said porthos or rather i don't exactly know how many i have when the two cavaliers had entered planchet fastened the door behind them
7344,8063-274116-0001.flac,hawthorn and wild hops formed an impenetrable fence behind which rose a white house with a high tiled roof
7345,8063-274116-0034.flac,they set off humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening
7346,8063-274116-0009.flac,oh they shall have as much as they like gently gently my man said d'artagnan we are getting on a little too fast a few oats and a good bed nothing more some bran and water for my horse said porthos
7347,8063-274116-0025.flac,and a very pretty name too said porthos
7348,8063-274116-0018.flac,monsieur le baron du valon
7349,8063-274116-0007.flac,porthos clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into the ground and ate or rather browsed upon them shells and all
7350,8063-274116-0022.flac,planchet turned to his housekeeper you have before you he said to her
7351,8063-274116-0000.flac,the cavaliers looked up and saw that what planchet had announced to them was true ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the rue de leon on the opposite side of the hostelry of the beaupeon a high hedge of bushy elders
7352,8063-274116-0003.flac,on second thoughts he took hold of his horse by the bridle and led it about thirty paces further on his two companions following him he then advanced about another thirty paces until he arrived at the door of a cart house lighted by an iron grating and lifting up a wooden latch pushed open one of the folding doors
7353,8063-274116-0011.flac,this room softly lighted by a lamp placed upon a table seemed from the end of the garden like a smiling image of repose comfort and happiness in every direction where the rays of light fell
7354,8063-274116-0040.flac,no one in the house was capable of taking the slightest notice
7355,8063-274116-0023.flac,and about two others as well said the lady with a very decided flemish accent madame is dutch inquired d'artagnan porthos curled his mustache the circumstance which was not lost upon d'artagnan who noticed everything i am from antwerp said the lady
7356,8063-274116-0013.flac,whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the window frames splendidly illuminated a damask tablecloth as white as snow the table was laid for two persons amber colored wine sparkled in a long cut glass bottle
7357,8063-274116-0010.flac,and came out into a little garden behind the house the principal front of which as we have already noticed faced the street as they approached
7358,8063-274116-0004.flac,he entered first leading his horse after him by the bridle into a small courtyard where an odor met them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable that smells all right said porthos loudly getting off his horse and i almost begin to think
7359,8063-274116-0006.flac,in the meantime d'artagnan who had dismounted with his usual agility inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight of parisian fields at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage
7360,8063-274116-0031.flac,do not trouble yourselves he said if truchen should leave the table now and then during supper for she will have to look after your bedrooms in fact the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently and they could hear on the first floor above them the creaking of the wooden bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor
7361,8063-274116-0019.flac,porthos bowed with a reverence which anne of austria would have approved of
7362,8063-274116-0026.flac,she ran away from a brute of a husband who was in the habit of beating her being myself a picard born i was always very fond of the artesian women and it is only a step from artois and flanders
7363,8063-274116-0002.flac,between the two a small door with a porch supported by a couple of pillars formed the entrance to the house the door was gained by a step raised a little from the ground
7364,8063-274116-0014.flac,near the table in a high backed armchair reclined fast asleep a woman of about thirty years of age her face the very picture of health and freshness upon her knees lay a large cat with her paws folded under her
7365,8063-274116-0015.flac,and her eyes half closed purrying in that significant manner which according to feline habits indicates perfect contentment
7366,8063-274116-0017.flac,introduced his two companions into the room where the table was already laid permit me my dear he said to present to you monsieur le chevalier d'artagnan my patron
7367,8063-274116-0028.flac,and which have brought her in ten thousand bravo planchet she is free and well off she has a cow a maid servant and old celestine at her orders she mends my linen knits my winter stockings she only sees me every fortnight
7368,8063-274115-0013.flac,the foreman clasped his hands together the two others got under the counters fearing porthos might have a taste for human flesh we shall only take a sort of a snack here said d'artagnan
7369,8063-274115-0029.flac,oh said planchet mousqueton is not dead and yet monsieur le baron is very fond of him
7370,8063-274115-0008.flac,he will very soon have none at all to do if this sort of thing continues grumbled the foreman who had planchet's word that he should be his successor in the midst of his despair
7371,8063-274115-0024.flac,and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner than you do now certainly certainly i should have said so formerly replied the good natured porthos with an embarrassment full of delicacy but formerly
7372,8063-274115-0009.flac,he approached porthos who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop itself he hoped that porthos would rise and that this movement would distract his devouring ideas what do you want my man asked porthos affably
7373,8063-274115-0007.flac,had already begun to disappear
7374,8063-274115-0016.flac,my shop is saved exclaimed planchet yes as the cheese was whispered the foreman what cheese the dutch cheese inside which a rat had made his way and we found only the rind left
7375,8063-274115-0017.flac,where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared alas thought the grocer addressing a look at d'artagnan full of entreaty which the latter half understood as soon as they had finished eating they set off it was late
7376,8063-274115-0005.flac,the shells of which were scattered all over the floor where they were trampled by everyone who went in and out of the shop porthos pulled from the stalk with his lips at one mouthful bunches of the rich muscatel raisins it their beautiful bloom
7377,8063-274115-0019.flac,and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows his woods and his rabbit warrens porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor when d'artagnan saw his two companions in earnest conversation
7378,8063-274115-0004.flac,where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose detected the delicious figs from provence filberts from the forest tours plums were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours his teeth like millstones cracked heaps of nuts
7379,8063-274115-0000.flac,would be one of the privileged travellers and as the plume in porthos's hat made the wooden candle suspended over the front jingle together
7380,8063-274115-0003.flac,and into the drawers full of sweetmeats
7381,8063-274115-0035.flac,because i don't know where it ends and also because it is full of poachers how can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you because they hunt my game and i hunt them
7382,8063-274115-0034.flac,nearly as beautiful as my forest at bari planchet opened his eyes very wide
7383,8063-274115-0032.flac,replied planchet somewhat humiliated but a country box ah ah i understand you are modest no monsieur le baron i speak the plain truth i have room for a couple of friends that's all
7384,8063-274115-0030.flac,and i was only saying this very morning to d'artagnan how much i regretted him but tell me planchet thank you monsieur le baron thank you good lad good lad how many acres of park have you got of park
7385,8063-274115-0002.flac,received porthos with respect mingled with the tenderest cordiality porthos who was a little cold and stiff in his manners at first on account of the social difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer soon began to soften when he perceived so much good feeling
7386,8063-274115-0031.flac,whereabouts monsieur at your chateau oh monsieur le baron i have neither chateau nor park nor meadows nor woods what have you got then inquired porthos and why do you call it a country seat i did not call it a country seat monsieur le baron
7387,8063-274115-0012.flac,yes but if raisins nuts and almonds are heating there is no doubt at all of it monsieur honey is very cooling said porthos stretched out his hand towards a small barrel of honey which was open and he plunged the scoop with
7388,8063-274115-0021.flac,in the beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees and where he had played under the green apple trees covered with red cheeked fruit he went on to say that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune he would return to nature
7389,8063-274115-0001.flac,for the morrow but the grocer had a heart of gold ever mindful of the good old times a trait that carries youth into old age so planchet notwithstanding a sort of internal shiver checked as soon as experienced
7390,8063-274115-0036.flac,which in these peaceful times is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale
7391,8063-274115-0018.flac,when the three riders who had left paris about six in the evening arrived at fontaine bleau
7392,8063-274115-0026.flac,if that be the case my dear planchet i will do so certainly replied porthos and
7393,8063-274115-0033.flac,in the first place they can walk about the king's forest which is very beautiful
7394,8063-274115-0023.flac,what is it inquired porthos looking all round him as if in search of the circumstance that annoyed planchet and desirous of freeing him from it why formerly said the grocer you used to call me planchet quite short
7395,8063-274115-0010.flac,i should like to pass you monsieur if it is not troubling you too much very well said porthos it does not trouble me in the least at the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband lifted him off the ground and placed him very gently on the other side
7396,8063-274115-0011.flac,smiling all the while with the same affable expression as soon as porthos had placed him on the ground the lad's legs so shook under him that he fell back upon some sacks of corks but noticing the giant's gentleness of manner he ventured again and said
7397,8063-274115-0025.flac,so that monsieur le baron continued the grocer
7398,8063-274115-0022.flac,how so why you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon
7399,8063-274115-0020.flac,separated himself from the whole world as he had done from porthos and from planchet the moon shone softly through the foliage of the forest the breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfumed to the horse's nostrils and they snorted and pranced along delightedly
7400,8063-274115-0028.flac,which made the animal's legs almost give way d'artagnan burst out laughing as he said take care planchet
7401,8063-274115-0006.flac,at each other without venturing to open their lips they did not know who porthos was for they had never seen him before
7402,8063-274115-0015.flac,they had never heard that an ogre was ever called monsieur le baron i will take a few biscuits to eat on the road said porthos carelessly and he emptied a whole jar of anasede biscuits into a huge pocket of his doublet
7403,8063-274115-0014.flac,so much the better you overwhelm me monsieur le baron the monsieur le baron had a great effect upon the men who detected a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind this title too reassured them
7404,8063-274115-0027.flac,but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim
7405,8063-274112-0028.flac,when you were there when we both were there a certain arab
7406,8063-274112-0011.flac,therefore at fontainebleau for to do so would be useless but with the permission of our readers follow him to the rue de lombardes where he was located at the sign of the pilond'ore
7407,8063-274112-0029.flac,he was a clever fellow although of a very odd complexion which was the same color as your olives well this arab whenever he had done eating or working used to sit down to rest himself
7408,8063-274112-0003.flac,why i think you are quite as well dressed as the
7409,8063-274112-0007.flac,quite exhausted from dancing you wish to leave me monsieur d'artagnan inquired the king with an air of astonishment
7410,8063-274112-0005.flac,whenever any one asked him how do you intend to dress yourself this evening he replied i shall undress myself at which the ladies all laughed
7411,8063-274112-0038.flac,thinks ah
7412,8063-274112-0030.flac,as i am resting myself now and smoked i cannot tell you what sort of magical leaves in a large amber mouthed tube
7413,8063-274112-0020.flac,but d'artagnan did not stir
7414,8063-274112-0025.flac,of course monsieur d'artagnan well well then the word distresses me beyond measure tell me why you are distressed planchet said d'artagnan if you say that you are not even asleep
7415,8063-274112-0035.flac,in point of fact then better to sit down than to stand up is plain enough especially when one may be fatigued and planchet smiled in a roguish way as for better to be lying down let that pass
7416,8063-274112-0018.flac,while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch could be heard retreating d'artagnan continued however to think of nothing except the blue corner of the sky a few paces from him
7417,8063-274112-0034.flac,i have no doubt of it but what do you think of his mode of reasoning
7418,8063-274112-0036.flac,it is in my opinion very absurd my own undoubted preference being for my bed and if you are not of my opinion it is simply as i have already had the honor of telling you because you are boring yourself to death planchet
7419,8063-274112-0010.flac,ah indeed said the musketeer continuing his imperceptible tone of irony
7420,8063-274112-0033.flac,he looked like a basket maker making baskets you are quite right planchet he did
7421,8063-274112-0040.flac,ah planchet my friend returned d'artagnan you are getting ambitious
7422,8063-274112-0009.flac,ah if i could only hold the balancing pole while you were dancing it would be a very different affair but my dear monsieur d'artagnan said the king gravely people dance without balancing poles
7423,8063-274112-0037.flac,exactly well then i am like his hare he has got a hare also then he has all sorts of animals well what does his hare do then
7424,8063-274112-0023.flac,and yet planchet fancied that in token of tacit approval he saw him imperceptibly smile at the words stupid this emboldened him to say are you asleep monsieur d'artagnan no planchet i am not even asleep replied the musketeer
7425,8063-274112-0000.flac,and exceedingly unhappy in fact d'artagnan d'artagnan we say for we must call him by his name to remind our readers of his existence d'artagnan we repeat
7426,8063-274112-0004.flac,it was just such a compliment d'artagnan would choose when he did not feel disposed to pay any other
7427,8063-274112-0024.flac,i am in despair said planchet to hear such a word as even well
7428,8063-274112-0016.flac,there was just enough blue and no more to fill one of the sacks of lentils or aricot which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor thus extended at his ease and sheltered in his place of observation behind the window d'artagnan
7429,8063-274112-0013.flac,a perfume of spices mingled with another perfume less exotic but more penetrating namely that which arose from the street ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer d'artagnan reclining in an immense straight backed chair with his legs not stretched out
7430,8063-274112-0022.flac,notwithstanding the noise produced by planchet's fall d'artagnan who had in the course of his existence heard many other and very different falls did not appear to pay the least attention to the present one besides
7431,8063-274112-0002.flac,the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to satisfy the cravings of his nature at every moment assailed by people asking him how do you think this costume suits me monsieur d'artagnan he would reply to them in quiet sarcastic tones
7432,8063-274112-0039.flac,and yet monsieur you have a look out upon the street yes and wonderfully interesting that is of course but it is no less true monsieur that
7433,8063-274112-0027.flac,in other words you have no longer your orders to issue or your men to review and manoeuvre you need the sound of guns drums and all that din of confusion
7434,8063-274112-0031.flac,better to sit down than to stand up to lie down than to sit down to be dead than to lie down he was an acutely melancholy arab and i remember him perfectly well
7435,8063-274112-0006.flac,and also to receive in exchange d'artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of private business at the moment d'artagnan made his request
7436,8063-274112-0014.flac,but simply placed upon a stool formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen both his arms were crossed over his head his head reclining upon his left shoulder like alexander the great his eyes
7437,8063-274112-0001.flac,had absolutely nothing whatever to do amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion after following the king during two whole days at fantainebleau
7438,8063-274112-0008.flac,any one who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave him sire said d'artagnan
7439,8063-274112-0026.flac,planchet you know that i am never bored except to day and the day before yesterday bah monsieur d'artagnan it is a week since you returned here from fontaine bleau
7440,8063-274112-0017.flac,seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the palace but was in the contrary a quiet easy going citizen in a state of stagnation between his dinner and supper or between his supper and his bed
7441,8063-274112-0021.flac,after a prolonged reflection on the subject the most ingenious means that suggested itself to him under the present circumstances was to let himself roll off the sack on to the floor murmuring at the same time against himself the word stupid but
7442,8063-274112-0019.flac,and his eyes fixed on d'artagnan who was either thinking dreaming or sleeping with his eyes open
7443,8063-274112-0032.flac,he used to cut off the heads of protestants with the most singular gusto precisely and then he used to embalm them when they were worth the trouble
7444,8063-274112-0015.flac,usually so quick and intelligent in their expression were now half closed and seemed fastened as it were upon a small corner of blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys
7445,8063-274112-0012.flac,and the weather was exceedingly warm there was only one window open and that one belonging to a room
7446,5808-54425-0014.flac,no one had ever looked at you until i picked you up and you've been strutting around ever since
7447,5808-54425-0008.flac,then he became a hanger on at the clubs a genteel loafer he used to say in his sober moments that at last he was one of the boys that sadness had spoken of he did not work
7448,5808-54425-0033.flac,come come wake up here three more jack what about your father father
7449,5808-54425-0011.flac,he went forth at once to celebrate his victory he did not return to her for three days then he was battered unkempt and thick of speech she looked at him in silent contempt for a while as he sat nursing his aching head
7450,5808-54425-0029.flac,oh a hair of the dog some men shave their dogs clean and then have hydrophobia here jack they drank and then as if the whiskey had done him good joe sat up in his chair
7451,5808-54425-0048.flac,he took another step towards her you put me out to night he repeated like a dog his step was steady and his tone was clear menacingly clear she shrank back from him
7452,5808-54425-0050.flac,still he crept slowly toward her his lips working and his hands moving convulsively joe joe she said hoarsely what's the matter
7453,5808-54425-0037.flac,at its close he relapsed into stupidity murmuring she throwed me down well sneered sadness you see drunken men tell the truth and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend
7454,5808-54425-0019.flac,alternately weeping aloud and quivering with drunken hiccoughing sobs
7455,5808-54425-0017.flac,he pleaded stretching out his hands to her her eyes blazed back at him but she sang on insolently tauntingly the very inanity of the man disgusted her
7456,5808-54425-0041.flac,this he gulped down and followed with another and another for a while he stood still brooding silently his red eyes blinking at the light then he turned abruptly and left the club
7457,5808-54425-0038.flac,you're disappointed aren't you i confess i am disappointed
7458,5808-54425-0027.flac,and he was about entering upon a discussion to prove that sadness had no soul when joe with blood shot eyes and dishevelled clothes staggered in and reeled towards them drunk again
7459,5808-54425-0006.flac,she had sought to check his course her threat of the severance of their relations had held him up for a little time and she began to believe that he was safe again he went back to the work he had neglected drank moderately
7460,5808-54425-0054.flac,she gazed at him fascinated she tried to scream and she could not this was not joe this was not the boy that she had turned and twisted about her little finger
7461,5808-54425-0044.flac,his voice was steadier now but grim what do you want
7462,5808-54425-0031.flac,then bracing himself up again he broke out suddenly
7463,5808-54425-0001.flac,and out of a soul of faith grow a spirit of unbelief the independence of respectability may harden into the insolence of defiance and the sensitive cheek of modesty into the brazen face of shamelessness
7464,5808-54425-0003.flac,it had taken barely five years to accomplish an entire metamorphosis of their characters in joe's case even a shorter time was needed he was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him and once started
7465,5808-54425-0025.flac,skaggsy looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor it made him think of maudiy he sighed and turned away i tell you sadness he said impulsively dancing is the poetry of motion
7466,5808-54425-0000.flac,five years is but a short time in the life of a man and yet many things may happen therein for instance the whole way of a family's life may be changed good natures may be made into bad ones
7467,5808-54425-0012.flac,she said finally with cutting scorn you ought to be put under a glass case and placed on exhibition he groaned and his head sunk lower a drunken man is always disarmed
7468,5808-54425-0036.flac,and if this story is one i'm a made man the drink seemed to revive the young man again
7469,5808-54425-0042.flac,it was very late when he reached hattie's door but he opened it with his latch key as he had been used to do he stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy as he had so often done before
7470,5808-54425-0010.flac,finally he took a turn for the better that endured so long that hatti sterling again gave him her faith then the woman made her mistake she warmed to him she showed him that she was proud of him
7471,5808-54425-0022.flac,and he half walked half fell down the street sadness and skaggsy were together at the club that night five years had not changed the latter as to wealth or position or inclination
7472,5808-54425-0005.flac,hattie sterling had given him both his greatest impulse for evil and for good she had at first given him his gentle push but when she saw that his collapse would lose her a faithful and useful slave
7473,5808-54425-0051.flac,the gown had fallen away from her breast and showed the convulsive fluttering of her heart
7474,5808-54425-0030.flac,lucky dog you might have known it would have happened sooner or later better sooner than ever skaggs smoked in silence and looked at joe
7475,5808-54425-0015.flac,and now this is the way you pay me back drunk half the time and half drunk the rest well you know what i told you the last time you got loaded i mean it too you're not the only star in sight see she laughed meanly
7476,5808-54425-0035.flac,yes he does a drunken man tells the truth in some cases said sadness oh let me alone man
7477,5808-54425-0058.flac,finally he flung her from him like a rag and sunk into a chair
7478,5808-54425-0045.flac,get out or i'll have you taken out she sprang up in bed glaring angrily at him his hands twitched nervously as if her will were conquering him and he were uneasy
7479,5808-54425-0032.flac,he never stole that money no he didn't he threatened to fall asleep now but the reporter was all alert he scented a story by jove he exclaimed did you hear that
7480,5808-54425-0028.flac,said sadness really it's a waste of time for joe to sober up hullo there as the young man brought up against him take a seat he put him in a chair at the table
7481,5808-54425-0020.flac,you shan't lay around my house he had already begun to fall into a drunken sleep but she took him got him to his feet and pushed him outside the door now go you drunken dog
7482,5808-54425-0007.flac,and acted in most things as a sound sensible being then all of a sudden he went down again and went down badly she kept her promise and threw him over
7483,5808-54425-0026.flac,yes replied sadness and dancing in rag time is the dialect poetry the reporter did not like this it savored a flippancy
7484,5808-54425-0016.flac,and began to sing you'll have to find another baby now for the first time he looked up and his eyes were full of tears tears both of grief and intoxication there was an expression of a whipped dog on his face
7485,5808-54425-0021.flac,and never put your foot inside this house again he stood outside swaying dizzily upon his feet and looking back with dazed eyes at the door then he muttered put me out will you put me out damn you well
7486,5808-54425-0057.flac,she struggled they held her her eyes prayed to his but his were the fire of dell she fell back upon her pillow in silence he had not uttered a word he held her
7487,5808-54425-0009.flac,but he soon tired of being separated from hattie and straightened up again after some demur she received him upon his former footing it was only for a few months he fell again for almost four years this had happened intermittently
7488,5808-54425-0024.flac,he mourned truly for his lost companion and to night he was in a particularly pensive mood some one was playing rag time on the piano and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music
7489,5808-54425-0004.flac,there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths for his will was as flabby as his conscience and his pride which stands to some men for conscience had no definite aim or direction
7490,5808-54425-0052.flac,and his hands sought each other while the fingers twitched over one another like coiling serpents you put me out you you and you made me what i am
7491,5808-54425-0018.flac,and on a sudden impulse she sprang up and struck him full in the face with the flat of her hand he was too weak to resist the blow and tumbling from the chair fell limply to the floor where he lay at her feet
7492,5808-54425-0039.flac,oh you have well don't handle it carelessly it might go off and sadness arose the reporter sat thinking for a time and then followed him leaving joe in a drunken sleep at the table
7493,5808-54425-0049.flac,back to the wall still his hands twitched
7494,5808-54425-0002.flac,it may be true that the habits of years are hard to change but this is not true of the first sixteen or seventeen years of a young person's life else kitty hamilton and joe could not so easily have become what they were
7495,5808-54425-0023.flac,and he was still a frequent visitor at the banner he always came in alone now for maudie had gone the way of all the half world and reached depths to which mister skaggs's job prevented him from following her however
7496,5808-54425-0034.flac,her here tell us about your father and the money if he didn't steal it who did who did that's it who did old man didn't steal it know he didn oh let him alone skaggsy
7497,5808-54425-0046.flac,he said yes and i'm going to do it again
7498,5808-54425-0047.flac,she started to rise but he took a step towards her and she paused he looked as she had never seen him look before his face was ashen and his eyes like fire and blood she quailed beneath the look
7499,5808-54425-0040.flac,there he lay for more than two hours when he finally awoke he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep a part of the helplessness of his intoxication had gone but his first act was to call for more whisky
7500,5808-54425-0056.flac,for an instant she lost their steady glare and then she found her voice the scream was checked as it began his fingers had closed over her throat just where the gown had left it temptingly bare they gave it the caress of death
7501,5808-54425-0055.flac,this was a terrible terrible man or a monster
7502,5808-54425-0053.flac,the realization of what he was of his foulness and degradation seemed just to have come to him fully you made me what i am and then you sent me away you let me come back and now you put me out
7503,5808-54425-0013.flac,his helplessness instead of inspiring her with pity inflamed her with an unfeeling anger that burst forth in a volume of taunts
7504,5808-54425-0043.flac,then he went directly to her room
7505,5808-48608-0000.flac,when it was the three hundred and forty seventh night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that ibrahim son of almadi continued now when the housemaster heard my name he sprang to his feet and said
7506,5808-48608-0031.flac,and ceased saying her permitted say when it was the three hundred and forty ninth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king
7507,5808-48608-0002.flac,and caruse with me this night
7508,5808-48608-0056.flac,woe to thee succour abu hassan al ziyadi i awoke a second time but knowing thee not i went to sleep again and he came to me a third time and still i knew thee not and went to sleep again then he came to me once more and said out on thee
7509,5808-48608-0035.flac,see ye if it be pierced if so it belongeth to some one of the folk if not tis a provision of allah for us so they examined it and found it unpierced
7510,5808-48608-0036.flac,now when it was the morrow the jew carried it to one of his brethren which was an expert in jewels and the man asked o such an one whence haddest thou this pearl
7511,5808-48608-0032.flac,that the man took the trencher and jar to the bazar but none would buy them of him however there presently passed by a man with a fish which was so stinking and so swollen
7512,5808-48608-0038.flac,it is worth seventy thousand dirhams and no more then he paid him that sum and the jew hired two porters to carry the money to his house as he came to his door a beggar accosted him saying
7513,5808-48608-0030.flac,so he took them to the bazar but none would buy them of him however presently as he stood in the market there passed by a man with a fish and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
7514,5808-48608-0046.flac,and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was the three hundred and fiftieth night she said it hath reached me o auspicious king
7515,5808-48608-0016.flac,it hath reached me o auspicious king that quoth the beggar to the woman give me an alms however small but she answered him how can i give thee aught when the king cutteth off the hands of all who give alms
7516,5808-48608-0057.flac,succour abu hassan al ziyadi after that i dared not sleep any more but watched the rest of the night and aroused my people and sent them on all sides in quest of thee then he gave me one myriad of dirhams saying this is for the khorasani
7517,5808-48608-0059.flac,and behold presently came the khorasani so i carried him into the house and brought out to him one myriad of dirhams saying here is thy money quoth he it is not my very money how cometh this
7518,5808-48608-0027.flac,yes replied she whereupon they prayed to allah extolled and exalted be he
7519,5808-48608-0041.flac,at the door is a pilgrim wight who seeketh admission to thee quoth i admit him so he came in and behold he was a kurasani we exchanged salutations and he said to me
7520,5808-48608-0009.flac,but i was abashed at his generosity and was ashamed to lie with her in his house so i said equip her and send her to my place
7521,5808-48608-0053.flac,but sleep was forbidden to me and i ceased not to awaken the boy and he to put me off till break of day when he saddled me the mule and i mounted and rode out not knowing whither to go
7522,5808-48608-0049.flac,and i have resolved to return so give me the moniys i deposited with thee yesterday when i heard this i was troubled and perplexed beyond measure of perplexity known to man and wanted not what repli to make him
7523,5808-48608-0023.flac,whereupon she fell to weeping for that which had befallen her and wailing with exceeding sore wail as she went along she came to a river and knelt down to drink being overcome with excess of thirst
7524,5808-48608-0037.flac,it was a gift of almighty allah to us and the other said it is worth a thousand dirhams and i will give thee that but take it to such an one for he hath more money and skill than i so the jew took it to the jeweller who said
7525,5808-48608-0058.flac,and other ten thousand saying spend freely of this and amend thy case therewith and set thine affairs in order
7526,5808-48608-0047.flac,that quoth abu hassan al ziyadi i called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities and spent freely and amply saying to myself by the time he returns allah will have relieved me with one or other of the bounties he hath by him
7527,5808-48608-0011.flac,then al mamun marvelled at the man's generosity and said gifted of allah is he never heard i of his like and he bade ibrahim ben almadi bring him to court that he might see him he brought him and the caliph conversed with him
7528,5808-48608-0029.flac,who said to him where is the cotton and the food quoth he such an one met me and complained to me of want whereupon i gave him the price of the yarn and they said how shall we do we have nothing to sell
7529,5808-48608-0033.flac,and he said to the jew wilt thou sell me thine unsalable ware for mine yes answered the jew and giving him the wooden trencher and jar took the fish and carried it home to his family who said
7530,5808-48608-0013.flac,a certain king once made proclamation to the people of his realm saying if any of you give alms of aught i will verily and assuredly cut off his hand
7531,5808-48608-0055.flac,expound to me thy case so i recounted to him my case and he wept sore and said to me
7532,5808-48608-0001.flac,indeed i wondered that such gifts should belong to any but the like of thee and fortune hath done me a good turn for which i cannot thank her too much but haply this is a dream for how could i hope that one of the caliphate house should visit my humble home
7533,5808-48608-0003.flac,as to the cause of my visit in the most courteous terms so i told him the whole affair first and last hiding naught and said to him now as to the food i have had my will but of the hand and wrist i have still to win my wish
7534,5808-48608-0021.flac,now this was the woman who had given two scones as an alms to the asker and whose hands had been cut off therefore and when the king married her her fellow wives envied her and wrote to the common husband that she was an unchaste
7535,5808-48608-0026.flac,so they prayed to almighty allah and the child came forth of the water to her safe and sound
7536,5808-48608-0045.flac,and when he brought them the man weighed out the money and handed it to me after which he went his way then i called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities
7537,5808-48608-0006.flac,may i be thy sacrifice begin with the sister and he answered with joy and good will so she came down and he showed me her hand and behold she was the owner of the hand and wrist quoth i
7538,5808-48608-0043.flac,so i wish to deposit these ten thousand dirhams with thee whilst i make my pilgrimage and return if the caravan march back and thou see me not then know that i am dead in which case the money is a gift from me to thee but if i come back
7539,5808-48608-0044.flac,it shall be mine i answered be it as thou wilt and thus please allah almighty so he brought out a leather bag and i said to the servant fetch the scales
7540,5808-48608-0024.flac,for fatigue of walking and for grief but as she bent her head the child which was at her neck fell into the water then she sat weeping bitter tears for her child and as she wept behold came up to men who said to her
7541,5808-48608-0034.flac,what shall we do with this fish quoth he we will broil it and eat it till it please allah to provide bread for us so they took it and ripping open its belly found therein a great pearl and told the head of the household who said
7542,5808-48608-0050.flac,for if i denied it he would put me on my oath and i should be disgraced in the world to come whilst if i told him that i had spent the money he would make an outcry and dishonour me before men
7543,5808-48608-0007.flac,seeketh in marriage my sister such an one and i call you to witness that i give her in wedlock to him and that he hath settled upon her ten thousand dinars and he said to me i give thee my sister in marriage at the portion aforesaid
7544,5808-48608-0015.flac,give me an alms and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say when it was three hundred and forty eighth night she said
7545,5808-48608-0012.flac,and his wit and good breeding so pleased him that he made him one of his chief officers and allah is the giver the bestower men also relate the tale of the woman whose hands were cut off for giving alms to the poor
7546,5808-48608-0020.flac,she hath had both her hands cut off said he let me see her so she brought her to him and he was ravished by her and married her and went in unto her and begat upon her a son
7547,5808-48608-0039.flac,quoth the jew to the asker but yesterday we were even as thou take thee half this money so he made two parts of it and each took his half
7548,5808-48608-0018.flac,the king heard of this whereupon he called her before him and cut off her hands after which she returned to her house now it chanced after a while that the king said to his mother i have a mind to take a wife
7549,5808-48608-0019.flac,so do thou marry me to a fair woman quoth she there is among our female slaves one who is unsurpassed in beauty but she hath a grievous blemish the king asked what is that and his mother answered
7550,5808-48608-0028.flac,and with the profit he laid in daily bread for his household one morning he went out and sold the day's yarn as wont when there met him one of his brethren who complained to him of need so he gave him the price of the thread and returned empty handed to his family
7551,5808-48608-0025.flac,what maketh thee weep quoth she i had a child at my neck and he hath fallen into the water they asked wilt thou that we bring him out to thee and she answered yes
7552,5808-48608-0004.flac,quoth he thou shalt have thy desire of the hand and rist also in shallah then said he to the slave girl o such an one bid such an one come down and he called his slave girls down one by one and showed them to me
7553,5808-48608-0017.flac,then he said i conjure thee by allah almighty give me an alms so when he adjured her by the holy name of allah she had ruth on him and gave him two scones
7554,5808-48608-0054.flac,whilst she fared on with me to the eastward of baghdad presently as i went along behold
7555,5808-48608-0040.flac,the baker and other tradesmen dunned and importuned me and my misery became extreme for i knew of no resource nor what to do things being on this wise there came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me
7556,5808-48608-0060.flac,so i told him the whole story and he wept and said by allah haddest thou told me the fact at first i had not pressed thee
7557,5808-48608-0052.flac,so i rose and bade the boy saddle me the she mule answered he o my lord it is yet but the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to rest i returned to my bed
7558,5808-48608-0005.flac,but i saw not my mistress among them and he said o my lord there is none left save my mother and sister but by allah i must needs have them also down and show them to thee so i marvelled at his courtesy and large heartedness and said
7559,5808-48608-0042.flac,tell me art thou abu hassan al ziyadi and i replied yes what is thy wish quoth he i am a stranger and am minded to make the pilgrimage but i have with me a great sum of money which is burdensome to bear
7560,5808-48608-0008.flac,i consent answered i and am herewith content whereupon he gave one of the bags to her and the other to the witnesses and said to me o our lord i desire to adorn a chamber for thee where thou mayst sleep with thy wife
7561,5808-48608-0048.flac,however on the very next day the servant came in to me and said thy friend the khorasan man is at the door admit him answered i so he came in and said to me i had purposed to make the pilgrimage
7562,5808-48608-0051.flac,so i said to him allah give thee health
7563,5808-48608-0014.flac,wherefore all the people abstained from almsdeed and none could give anything to any one now it chanced that one day a beggar accosted a certain woman and indeed hunger was sore upon him and said to her
7564,5808-48608-0022.flac,having just given birth to the boy so he wrote to his mother bidding her carry the woman into the desert and leave her there the old queen obeyed his commandment and abandon the woman and her son in the desert
7565,5808-48608-0010.flac,and by thy being o commander of the faithful he sent me with her such an equipage that my house for all its greatness was too strait to hold it and i begot on her this boy that standeth in thy presence
7566,1116-137572-0005.flac,is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected because reality rarely measures up to imagination the first answer is almost bound to be no this is not what i expected and the first emotion tends to be disappointment
7567,1116-137572-0055.flac,hoping to keep their marriage unchanged in its first stage of promise if both husband and wife accept maturing responsibilities as they come their marriage relationship will keep pace with their own development and will therefore become increasingly satisfying to them
7568,1116-137572-0015.flac,compromise will lift these essentially petty decisions of precedence above the level of selfishness decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both not the selfish or narrow wish of either
7569,1116-137572-0045.flac,seven there can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment
7570,1116-137572-0043.flac,maturity brings recognition of human imperfections in the most heroic but also develops the ability to weigh big and little things and to
7571,1116-137572-0020.flac,builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end it is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish what is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being head of the house if your spouse craves that distinction by all means handed over without delay
7572,1116-137572-0008.flac,and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage these traits cannot be changed overnight nor is it necessary or it all wise that they should be john attracts mary and she appeals to him because the personality of each one is what it is
7573,1116-137572-0051.flac,mary may soonler lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement or the combination may be reversed frankness must go clothed an tact stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it
7574,1116-137572-0007.flac,roughly both the helps and the hindrances to marriage happiness can be lumped under one word personalities temperament manerisms tastes all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person make up the chief source of the advantages
7575,1116-137572-0025.flac,and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a top heavy hypocrisy a superstructure calculated to impress the observer but built on a shaky foundation of chaos
7576,1116-137572-0037.flac,or by going out without his wife or by having his friends in when she is not around five the general level of emotion is what counts not the spectacular scaling of peaks staking all on high moments is melodrama with no comic relief
7577,1116-137572-0006.flac,regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than although different from what the imagination pictured knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage but likely to occur in all
7578,1116-137572-0024.flac,compromise not submission should be the rule if john forges ahead on one count mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front three
7579,1116-137572-0023.flac,any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it this changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband all this must be taken into account in making decisions
7580,1116-137572-0019.flac,regardless of its effect on the mate is short sighted in the extreme even if you could care only for personal pleasure that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure saging a contest or a succession of small contests for the sake of finding out who is boss
7581,1116-137572-0042.flac,you remember other people you once thought you loved and wonder panic stricken how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did this is probably an almost universal experience marking not the beginning of the end of love
7582,1116-137572-0030.flac,and dry up the source of refreshment you are trying to tap fatigue and nervousness expressed breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience four too great concentration is to be avoided

7614,1116-137572-0028.flac,knowing themselves accepted they lounge mentally mannerly and physically when at home or elsewhere alone together some of this relaxation is a good thing but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy

7619,1116-137572-0044.flac,always it is the unturned page that holds the answer to the question how goes it with this marriage the present is useful only as a foundation stone for the future which is being built up out of many fleeting present moments each quickly lost in the past
7620,1116-137572-0003.flac,when one has received the promise of something greatly desired but must wait a while before its delivery the happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight
7621,1116-137572-0013.flac,here are nine guideposts to help john and mary along their road one the first requirement is the building of a union that is just to both the smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires
7622,1116-132851-0026.flac,so one day the brownie asked jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn and whether he would allow them to dance there of course jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie and he ordered barbaik to spread her best tablecloths in the barn
7623,1116-132851-0018.flac,she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them
7624,1116-132851-0012.flac,indeed barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied if the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly i should like my churns to be full
7625,1116-132851-0010.flac,the racks filled with hay the cows milked and the pails standing neatly in a row
7626,1116-132851-0006.flac,at first under different animal shapes since that time partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves we have continued to transform ourselves and it was in this way that i got to know you how exclaimed jegu filled with astonishment
7627,1116-132851-0016.flac,and at this time the girl did not turn rudely away but listened patiently to the end
7628,1116-132851-0011.flac,and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help to be sure jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else
7629,1116-132851-0019.flac,barbaik was furious
7630,1116-132851-0008.flac,jegu declared that nothing could be easier and then taking off his hat he thanked the dwarf heartily and led his horses back to the farm next morning was a holiday and barbaik was awake earlier than usual
7631,1116-132851-0021.flac,while now i can receive no presents except from my husband i can never dance except with my husband oh you wretched dwarf i will never never forgive you in spite of her fierce words no one knew better than barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her
7632,1116-132851-0017.flac,and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time just like a young lady and as for the rest of the day
7633,1116-132851-0024.flac,but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as they looked at her horse at length she caught some words uttered by one man to another why the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail and turned in her saddle
7634,1116-132851-0013.flac,and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry and she need never give another thought to the matter if she found the rye bread too hard to bake or the oven taking too long to heat she just murmured i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bed box
7635,1116-132851-0002.flac,one evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink he was tired with a long day's work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals waiting till they had done and thinking all the while of barbaik
7636,1116-132851-0007.flac,but how are you going to do it exclaimed jegu wonderingly that is my affair perhaps i may tell you later meanwhile you just eat and sleep and don't worry yourself about anything
7637,1116-132851-0000.flac,and shoes with silver buckles the women were all filled with envy but little cared barbiyaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's and that she had more partners than any other girl
7638,1116-132851-0025.flac,but it was of no use he declined to move out of a walk
7639,1116-132851-0022.flac,and after receiving an invitation to a wedding she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there to her great joy he consented bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted
7640,1116-132851-0023.flac,she had hardly spoken when the horse appeared and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held at first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing
7641,1116-132851-0027.flac,when all was ready the dwarfs and new green suits came bustling in very happy and merry and took their seats at the table but in a moment they all sprang up with a cry and ran away screaming for barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet and all their poor little toes were burnt
7642,1116-132851-0014.flac,why am i not already back from morleig with my milk pot empty my butter bowl inside it a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate and the money i have gained in my apron pocket and in the morning when she got up lo and behold
7643,1116-132851-0001.flac,and what was worse often made fun of him with the rest
7644,1116-132851-0009.flac,as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off she went first to the cow house which it was her duty to keep clean but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down
7645,1116-132851-0028.flac,you won't forget that in a hurry she said smiling grimly to herself but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water which they poured on the fire then they joined hands and danced round it singing wicked traitress
7646,1116-132851-0003.flac,when a voice came out of the gorge close by
7647,1116-132851-0004.flac,it is i the brownie of the lake replied the voice but where are you inquired jegu look close and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog i can take he added proudly any shape i choose
7648,1116-132851-0005.flac,and even which is much harder be invisible if i want to then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear replied jegu certainly if you wish and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf all dressed in green
7649,1116-132851-0020.flac,her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure but when she looked at jegu and beheld his red face squinting eyes and untidy hair her anger was doubled
7650,1116-132851-0015.flac,and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron and she believed that all this was owing to jegu and she could no longer do without him even in her thoughts when things had reached this pass the brownie told the young man that he had better ask barbaik to marry him
7651,1116-132847-0032.flac,and it is owing to her that i am here but what are you doing in this nest i am sitting on six eggs of stone and i shall not be set free till they are hatched
7652,1116-132847-0016.flac,the pink and white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace while her long black hair was intertwined with strings of coral and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea at the sight of her huarn stopped dazzled by her beauty
7653,1116-132847-0021.flac,when it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot
7654,1116-132847-0020.flac,the young man gazed at her in surprise could any one so rich and so beautiful really wish to be his wife he looked at her again and bellah was forgotten as he answered a man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer i can only accept it with joy
7655,1116-132847-0023.flac,jump she replied but soon the noise grew louder and like cries what is it asked houarn beginning to feel uncomfortable just the crickets on the hearth said she and broke into a song which drowned the cries from the pot
7656,1116-132847-0012.flac,and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner but he only laughed
7657,1116-132847-0025.flac,and four men stood before him hooarn save us we entreat you and save yourself too murmured they not daring to raise their voices
7658,1116-132847-0017.flac,my name is huarn he answered
7659,1116-132847-0038.flac,and turning rapidly flung it over the witch's head become in body what you are in soul cried she and in an instant the lovely fairy of the sea was a toad horrible to look upon she struggled hard to tear the net asunder but it was no use
7660,1116-132847-0004.flac,the girl was very unhappy as she listened to this and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things she implored huarn not to leave her but he would listen to nothing the birds he said continue flying until they reach a field of corn
7661,1116-132847-0036.flac,very soon she led her visitor into the great hall where wine and fruit were always waiting and on the table lay the magic knife left there by houarn
7662,1116-132847-0028.flac,little staff of apple tree over the earth and over the sea up in the air be guide to me everywhere to wander free and immediately the stick became a smart little horse with a rosette at each ear and a feather on his forehead he stood quite still
7663,1116-132847-0033.flac,when you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist and shut her up in it for ever but where am i to find a young man's clothes asked she i will show you he replied
7664,1116-132847-0001.flac,and soon they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their lots
7665,1116-132847-0015.flac,as soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise he prepared to jump into the lake and swim to shore but the bird had guessed his intentions and plunged beneath the water
7666,1116-132847-0022.flac,but it did not sound the least like that to huarn there it is again he said after a short pause
7667,1116-132847-0034.flac,and the fourth and iron without waiting for orders they sat down in the nest and crossing their legs comfortably began to prepare the suit of clothes for bellah with one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat
7668,1116-132847-0024.flac,but though houarn held his peace he was not as happy as before something seemed to have gone wrong and then he suddenly remembered bellah is it possible i can have forgotten her so soon
7669,1116-132847-0040.flac,in a car drawn by six cockshafers which once had been the six stone eggs here i am he exclaimed you have broken the spell that held me and now come and get your reward and dismounting from his chariot he led them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels
7670,1116-132847-0039.flac,her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her his little paws crossed over his little heart bellah felt as if fingers were tightening round her throat but she managed to cry is this you my hawarn is this you it is i croaked the little frog
7671,1116-132847-0014.flac,the island was large and lying almost across it was a lake with a narrow opening to the sea houan paid the boatman and sent him away and then proceeded to walk round the lake
7672,1116-132847-0018.flac,and she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds
7673,1116-132847-0030.flac,and galloped like a straw carried along by a tempest till they reached the foot of a rock called the leap of the deer
7674,1116-132847-0029.flac,the swallow is less swift than the wind the wind is less swift than the lightning but you my horse if you love me must be swifter than them all for there is the part of my heart that suffers the best part of my heart that is in danger and the horse heard her
7675,1116-132847-0003.flac,that is quite clear replied houarn turning away to his work whenever they met they repeated their grievances and at length houarn's patience was exhausted and one morning he came to bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune
7676,1116-132847-0031.flac,to save you repeated bellah but who are you my little friend
7677,1116-132847-0000.flac,and a girl called bela postik they were cousins and as their mothers were great friends and constantly in and out of each other's houses they had often been laid in the same cradle and had played and fought over their games when they are grown up they will marry said the mothers
7678,1116-132847-0019.flac,came from shipwrecked vessels and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water i do not wonder exclaimed houarn who now felt quite at home i do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you the rich are always envied
7679,1116-132847-0006.flac,well go then since you must but first i will divide with you all that my parents left me and going to her room she opened a small chest and took from it a bell a knife and a little stick this bell she said can be heard at any distance however far
7680,1116-132847-0026.flac,and no sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes as she had done to all our forerunners who are in the fish pond still where you will shortly join them
7681,1116-132847-0037.flac,and to the pond which contained the fish their sides shining with a thousand different colors
7682,1116-132847-0010.flac,and he walked on to pont avain a pretty little town built on the bank of a river he was sitting on a bench outside an inn
7683,1116-132847-0027.flac,it was at this very moment that bellah who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy heard the fairy bell tinkle violently at the sound she grew pale for she knew it meant the houarn was in danger
7684,1116-132847-0007.flac,but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger the knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go i will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards
7685,1116-132847-0013.flac,but the men did not know how this was to be done and shaking their heads over his obstinacy left him to his fate
7686,1116-132847-0008.flac,and the bell to tell me of your perils the stick i shall keep for myself so that i can fly to you if ever you have need of me then they cried for a little on each other's necks and houarn started for the mountains but in those days as in these beggars abounded
7687,1116-132847-0035.flac,and with it in her hand she stepped into the blue boat which conducted her to the palace of shells the groch seemed overjoyed to see her and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man
7688,1116-132847-0005.flac,like them i shall seek till i get what i want that is money to buy a cow and am pig to fatten and if you love me bellah you won't attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage the girl saw it was useless to say more so she answered sadly
7689,1116-132847-0002.flac,i would rent a bit of ground from the master and then we could be married yes answered bellah with a deep sigh but we live in such hard times and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again we shall have long to wait
7690,1116-132847-0011.flac,and the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake
7691,1116-132847-0009.flac,and through every village he passed they followed huarn in crowds mistaking him for a gentleman because there were no holes in his clothes there is no fortune to be made here he thought to himself it is a place for spending and not earning i see i must go further
7692,289-121665-0038.flac,why she exclaimed smiling again i can sew them on of course then she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran o'er hill and dail o and tried what she could as a shepherdess should to tack to each sheep its tail o
7693,289-121665-0007.flac,good morning little bo peep and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon a short stick she was bent nearly double by weight of many years her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals
7694,289-121665-0004.flac,fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair all the shepherds and shepherdesses upon the hills both young and old soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed
7695,289-121665-0044.flac,and if you had been observing you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found
7696,289-121665-0006.flac,laying aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her aged mother one day while thus occupied
7697,289-121665-0039.flac,but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail and ran away from her and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met
7698,289-121665-0040.flac,came hobbling to her side and asked what are you doing with my cat tails your cat tails replied bo peep in surprise what do you mean why these tails are all cut from white pussy cats and i put them on the tree to dry
7699,289-121665-0035.flac,and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious but there is an end to all troubles no matter how severe they may seem to be and it happened one day as bo peep did stray onto a meadow hard by
7700,289-121665-0003.flac,decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself she was a little mite of a child with flowing nut brown locks and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths she wore a light gray frock
7701,289-121665-0014.flac,the old woman chuckled softly as if the answer amused her and replied no one knows all about anything my dear but i know all about my sheep protested little bo peep do you indeed
7702,289-121665-0026.flac,gazed below her quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her trant flock looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle shepherdess bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them
7703,289-121665-0041.flac,what are you doing with them i thought they belonge to my sheep answered bo peep sorrowfully
7704,289-121665-0015.flac,then you are wiser than most people and if you know all about them and you also know they will come home of their own accord and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual
7705,289-121665-0043.flac,no one in this world knows all about anything sheep do not have long tails there is only a little stump to answer for a tail neither do rabbits have tails nor bears nor many other animals
7706,289-121665-0030.flac,so you have found your sheep dearie she said in her cracked voice yes replied little bo peep with difficulty repressing a sob but look mother theyve all left their tails behind them why so they have exclaimed the old woman
7707,289-121665-0031.flac,and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her what do you suppose has become of their tails asked the girl oh someone has probably cut them off they make nice tippets in winter time you know
7708,289-121665-0037.flac,and after pondering the matter for a time she became discouraged and thinking she was no better off than before the tails were found she began to weep and to bewail her misfortune but amidst her tears she bethought herself of her needle and thread
7709,289-121665-0023.flac,but as it was now time for luncheon she opened her little basket and ate of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring near by
7710,289-121665-0022.flac,little bo peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleeting but when she awoke she found it a joke for still they were a fleeting the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill
7711,289-121665-0000.flac,and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills and each morning the mother took her crook
7712,289-121665-0046.flac,and now little bo peep no more did weep my tale of tales ends here
7713,289-121665-0002.flac,upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the ewes and lambs so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient shepherdess so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage little bo peep as she was called
7714,289-121665-0013.flac,oh yes they know me every one and do not you know the sheep i can call every one by name said bo peep confidently for though i am so young a shepherdess i am fond of my sheep and know all about them
7715,289-121665-0024.flac,she decided she would not wait any longer so up she took her little crook determined for to find them and began climbing the hill when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about
7716,289-121665-0011.flac,but where is your crook on the grass beside me and where are your sheep bo peep looked up and could not see them they must have strayed over the top of the hill she said and i will go and seek them
7717,289-121665-0025.flac,only a green valley and another hill beyond now really alarmed for the safety of her charge bo peep hurried into the valley and up the farther hillside panting and tired she reached the summit and pausing breathlessly
7718,289-121665-0045.flac,so now little one run away home and try to be more thoughtful in the future your sheep will never miss the tails
7719,289-121665-0019.flac,said the old woman i am going over the hill top myself and i will send the sheep back to you so she got upon her feet and began climbing the hill and the girl heard her saying as she walked away little bo peep has lost her sheep
7720,289-121665-0029.flac,but after a while the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lampkins so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her
7721,289-121665-0012.flac,do not be in a hurry croaked the old woman they will return presently without your troubling to find them do you think so asked bo peep of course do not the sheep know you
7722,289-121665-0009.flac,good morning mother can i do anything for you no dearie returned the woman in a cracked voice but i will sit by your side and rest for a time the girl made room on the mound beside her
7723,289-121665-0017.flac,perhaps you have never noticed their tales at all no answered bo peep thoughtfully i don't know that i ever have the woman laughed so hard at this reply
7724,289-121665-0018.flac,that she began to cough and this made the girl remember that her flock had strayed away i really must go and find my sheep she said rising to her feet and then i shall be sure to notice their tals and see if they wag them sit still my child
7725,289-121665-0016.flac,oh said little bo peep in surprise do they wag their tails i never noticed that indeed exclaimed the old woman then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep
7726,289-121665-0005.flac,and there were many willing hands to aid her if which was not often she needed their assistance bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and
7727,289-121665-0032.flac,and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep and so driving them before her she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost tails
7728,289-121665-0034.flac,and bo peep had fully decided to seek for the tails and find them before she related the story of their loss to any one each day for many days after that little bo peep wandered about the hills seeking the tails of her sheep
7729,289-121665-0010.flac,and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy finger sew up the seams of the new frock she was making by and by the woman asked why do you come out here to sew because i am a shepherdess replied the girl
7730,289-121665-0021.flac,very soon i shall see the sheep coming back but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance soon the head of the little shepherdess began to nod
7731,289-121665-0042.flac,i must hunt until i find those that belong to my sheep my dear said the old woman i have been deceiving you you said you knew all about your sheep and i wanted to teach you a lesson for however wise we may be
7732,289-121665-0027.flac,but when she came near she stopped in amazement and held up her little hands with a pretty expression of dismay she had found them indeed but it made her heart bleed
7733,289-121665-0033.flac,but soon the sun began to sink over the hill tops and she knew she must take her sheep home before night overtook them she did not tell her mother of her misfortune for she feared the old shepherdess would scold her
7734,289-121665-0001.flac,and started out with her sheep that they might feed upon the tender juicy grasses with which the hills abounded the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side
7735,289-121665-0028.flac,nothing was left to each sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be and little bo peep was so heart broken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly
7736,289-121665-0020.flac,and doesn't know where to find em but leave em alone and they'll come home all wagging their tails behind em little bo peep sat still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hillside and disappear over the top by and by she thought
7737,289-121665-0008.flac,deep wrinkles seamed her face and hands while her nose and chin were so pointed that they nearly met she was not pleasant to look upon but bo peep had learned to be polite to the aged so she answered sweetly
7738,289-121665-0036.flac,the little shepherdess was overjoyed at this discovery and reaching up her crook she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock but how to fasten them on to her sheep again was the question
7739,289-121652-0029.flac,which it is said was printed by john worthington and son in the strand london in seventeen twelve under the name of ye melodious rhymes of mother goose but even this story of martha gooch
7740,289-121652-0000.flac,none of us whether children or adults needs an introduction to mother goose those things which are earliest impressed upon our minds cling to them most tenaciously the snatches sung in the nursery are never forgotten
7741,289-121652-0004.flac,are evidently drawn from a variety of sources while they are taken altogether a happy union of rhyme wit
7742,289-121652-0024.flac,is of about the same date as boston's there lived in a town in sussex about the year seventeen o four an old woman named martha gooch she was a capital nurse and in great demand to care for newly born babies therefore
7743,289-121652-0003.flac,the ballads of the nursery follow us from childhood to old age and they are readily brought from memoryes recesses at any time to amuse our children or our grandchildren the collection of jingles we know and love as the melodies of mother goose
7744,289-121652-0031.flac,in seventeen eighty five none of the earlier editions however contained all the rhyme so well known at the present day since every decade has added its quota to the mass of jingles attributed to mother goose
7745,289-121652-0010.flac,and little boy blue in sixteen ninety seven charles pereut published in france
7746,289-121652-0028.flac,at one time mistress gooch was nursing a child of mister ronald barkley a physician residing in the town and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them in time he wrote them all down and made a book of them
7747,289-121652-0005.flac,the research after the author of each individual verse would indeed be hopeless it would be folly to suppose them all the composition of uneducated old nurses for many of them contain much reflection wit and melody
7748,289-121652-0030.flac,is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence the earliest english edition of mother goose's melodies that is absolutely authentic was issued by john newburry of london about the year seventeen sixty and the first authentic american edition
7749,289-121652-0022.flac,indeed as mister william h whitmore points out in his clever monograph upon mother goose albany eighteen eighty nine it is very doubtful whether in seventeen nineteen
7750,289-121652-0009.flac,which contained many of the identical pieces that have been handed down to us but the name of mother goose was evidently not then known in this edition were the rhymes of little jack homer old king cole mistress mary sing a song of sixpence
7751,289-121652-0017.flac,printed by t fleet at his printing house in pudding lane seventeen nineteen price two coppers mister willm a wheeler the editor of herd in houghton's elaborate edition of mother goose eighteen seventy reiterated this assertion
7752,289-121652-0018.flac,and the writer in the boston transcript of june seventeenth eighteen sixty four says fleet's book was partly a reprint of an english collection of songs berkley's and the new title was doubtless a compliment by the printer to his mother in law goose for her contributions

7754,289-121652-0013.flac,america bases her claim to mother goose upon the following statement made by the late john fleet eliot a descendant of thomas fleet the printer at the beginning of the eighteenth century there lived in boston a lady named eliza goose
7755,289-121652-0034.flac,it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth or a living eliza goose martha gooche or the meer oy of perou the songs that cluster around her name are what we love
7756,289-121652-0014.flac,written also vergoose and vertigoose who belonged to a wealthy family her eldest daughter elizabeth goose or vertigoose
7757,289-121652-0007.flac,are doubtless offshoots from ancient folklor songs and have descended to us through many centuries the connection of mother goose with the rhymes which bear her name is difficult to determine and in fact three countries claim her for their own
7758,289-121652-0006.flac,it is said that shelley wrote pussy cat mew and dean swift little bo peep and these assertions are as difficult to disprove as to prove some of the older verses however
7759,289-121652-0026.flac,seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them that they began to call her mother goose in derision the term being derived from queen goosefoot the mother of charlemagne the old nurse paid no attention to her critics
7760,289-121652-0023.flac,boston children at that date says mister whitmore were fed upon gospel food and it seems extremely improbable that an addition could have been sold
7761,289-121652-0027.flac,but continued to sing her rhymes as before for however much grown people might laugh at her the children seemed to enjoy them very much and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses
7762,289-121652-0011.flac,although perrout's tals differ materially from those we now know under this title they comprised the sleeping beauty the fairy little red riding hood blue beard puss an boots
7763,289-121652-0002.flac,and see the kindly wrinkled face of the grandmother as she croons the old ditties to quiet our restless spirits one generation is linked to another by the everlasting spirit of song
7764,289-121652-0025.flac,through long years of service as nurse she came to be called mother gooch this good woman had one peculiarity she was accustomed to croon queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges and these rhymes
7765,289-121652-0001.flac,nor are they ever recalled without bringing back with them marades of slumbering feelings and half forgotten images we hear the sweet low voice of the mother singing soft lullabies to her darling
7766,289-121652-0037.flac,for that reason i have written this book in making the stories i have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes and my hope is that the little ones will like them and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations
7767,289-121652-0021.flac,repeated researches at worcester having failed to bring to light the supposed copy and no record of it appearing on any catalogue there we may dismiss the entire story with the supposition that mister eliot misunderstood the remarks made to him
7768,289-121652-0020.flac,but the rest of the story is unsupported by any evidence whatever in fact all that mister eliot knew of it was the statement of the late edward a croninshield of boston that he had seen fleet's edition in the library of the american antiquarian society
7769,289-121652-0012.flac,riquet with the tuft cinderella and little thumb eight stories in all on the cover of the book was depicted an old lady holding in her hand a distaff

7771,289-121652-0019.flac,she was the mother of sixteen children and a typical old woman who lived in a shoe we may take it to be true that fleet's wife was of the vergoose family and that the name was often contracted to goose
7772,289-121652-0016.flac,tried what ridicule could effect and actually printed a book under the title songs of the nursery or mother goose's melodies for children on the title page was the picture of a goose with a very long neck and a mouth wide open and below this

7774,289-121652-0036.flac,leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story perhaps therein may lie part of their charm but however that may be i have thought the children might like the stories told at greater length that they may dwell the longer upon their favorite heroes and heroines
7775,289-121652-0015.flac,and in due time gave birth to a son like most mothers in law in our day the importance of missus goose increased with the appearance of her grandchild and poor mister fleet half distracted with her endless nursery ditties finding all other means fail
7776,289-121652-0035.flac,and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does mother goose herself many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves telling their story tersely but completely there are others which are but bare suggestions
7777,289-121652-0032.flac,some of the earlier verses have become entirely obsolete and it is well they have for many were crude and silly and others were coarse it is simply a result of the greater refinement of modern civilization
7778,696-92939-0005.flac,she studied at the london hospital a place we are told where the hardest and most difficult conditions prevailed and where the nurses were worked to the limit of their strength she also held the position of a nurse in two other hospitals
7779,696-92939-0009.flac,but her mother was close to her heart and she saw her as often as she could i may be looked on as an old maid she is reported as saying but with my work and my mother i am a very happy one and desire nothing more as long as i have these two

7781,696-92939-0031.flac,only to learn later that it had indeed been declared and that miss cavell would face a firing squad at two o'clock the following morning mister whitlock then urged baron von der lonken
7782,696-92939-0030.flac,all through the day the american legation sent message after message to the german authorities asking for information they received none at six twenty in the evening they were told by a subordinate that the sentence had not been given

7785,696-92939-0017.flac,a blow was the only response when she tried to expostulate she was taken to prison and placed in solitary confinement her arrest was shrouded with the most careful secrecy for the germans did not want to have the representatives of neutral governments
7786,696-92939-0027.flac,he did everything possible to secure her pardon or at least a moderation of the punishment he wrote to baron von der lonken pointing out in a clear and decisive manner that miss cavell had served the germans by caring for their wounded
7787,696-92939-0003.flac,and were taught the value of leading useful lives and the glory of self sacrifice as was customary at the time when she was a young girl she received her education on the continent attending school in the city of brussels in belgium
7788,696-92939-0007.flac,and at first they were inclined to look upon miss cavell as an untrained outsider but her tact efficiency and skill soon won the hearts of these good women who afforded her every courtesy and entered into cordial co operation with her
7789,696-92939-0015.flac,and soon spies began to come to the governor with tales and fabrications of the crimes that she had been committing in their eyes they bore witness that she had given an overcoat to a frenchman who was cold and hungry and the frenchman later escaped over the dutch frontier
7790,696-92939-0012.flac,miss cavell desired to continue her hospital work and went to the governor von bissing to get permission to do so he granted it for the quiet english nurse made an impression upon him we are told that the arrogant german formed a high opinion of her
7791,696-92939-0019.flac,to get what information he could from brand whitlock the american minister in belgium he went at once to the german authorities but they evaded his questions and waited ten days before giving him a reply then the german sent him a statement

7794,696-92939-0034.flac,early in the morning with her eyes bandaged miss cavell was let out to face the rifles of the huns she wore an english flag over her bosom only germans were witnesses of the execution but the german chaplain who attended said that she died like a heroine

7798,696-92939-0008.flac,her home succeeded so well that three years after its commencement miss cavell started also a training school for nurses she was popular everywhere in the belgian capital
7799,696-92939-0038.flac,she was tried with great haste and with great secrecy and after the trial the sentence was carried out far more speedily than usual moreover they had deceived mister whitlock and the other members of the american legation and had done so deliberately
7800,696-92939-0021.flac,for she was not accused at any time of having been a spy but they had planned to try her for her life and mister whitlock soon guessed this in spite of the fact that the germans kept their preparations from him so far as possible
7801,696-92939-0020.flac,and furnishing them with guides to help them to the dutch frontier whence they might escape into holland and return to england this was the german statement if what they said were true there was still no cause for killing the unfortunate woman in their power

7804,696-92939-0023.flac,another lawyer who was a belgian suddenly appeared and told the americans that there was not the least cause for them to worry as miss cavell was sure to receive only just treatment he also promised to let them know when the trial was to take place
7805,696-92939-0022.flac,an american lawyer mister de levell was requested by mister whitlock to take miss cavell's case and do whatever was possible in her behalf he was not allowed to see the prisoner and was not even allowed to look at the documents in the case until the trial began

7812,696-92939-0014.flac,but this made no difference to the authorities they were determined to detect her in some crime and punish her it was not fitting they thought that an enemy should be engaged in works of mercy even though they themselves might benefit thereby

7815,696-92939-0036.flac,and in miss cavell's hometown every eligible man was sworn into the army a bitter denunciation of the german act was made by sir edward grey the germans themselves had only a poor excuse for what they had done
7816,696-92939-0037.flac,in brief the case against the german authorities is as follows they had not previously inflicted the death penalty for the offence of which miss cavell was accused they had kept her in solitary confinement and prevented her from consulting an advocate up to the time of her trial
7817,696-92939-0028.flac,and that the death sentence had never before been inflicted for the crime of which she was accused he also wrote a note to the baron which is as follows my dear baron i am too ill to present my request to you in person
7818,696-93314-0064.flac,he's very very clever my child
7819,696-93314-0063.flac,when he had told the girl everything and when she was able to do anything but laugh and cry and cling to him with thin hands she said dear i do so hate to think badly of any one but do you really think that man was mistaken
7820,696-93314-0049.flac,covering a clear cut mask of set endurance and there was no work that could shut out that sight no temptation of the world the flesh or the devil to give him even the relief of a fight he had no temptations he had never had but the one
7821,696-93314-0058.flac,that's all the onlooker got out at the next station short of owning to his own lie he had done what he could to insure its being found out for the lie it was or at least for a mistake
7822,696-93314-0046.flac,he worked as he had never worked in his life because he knew that if he did not take to work he should take to drink or worse devils and he set his teeth and swore that her lover should not be degraded he knew that she loved him and there was a kind of fierce pain pleasure
7823,696-93314-0050.flac,his soul was naked to the bitter wind of the actual and the days went by went by and every day he knew more and more surely that he had lied and thrown away his soul and that the wages of sin were death and no other thing whatever
7824,696-93314-0042.flac,they parted and now the onlooker dared not meet her dared not call at the house as he had used to do at last the father pressed him he went he met her and it was as though he had met the ghost of her whom he had loved
7825,696-93314-0056.flac,it's better to die of a bullet in south africa than a fright in london that roused the lover as it was meant to do i don't really know what business it is of yours sir he said
7826,696-93314-0051.flac,and gradually little by little the whole worth of life seemed to lie in the faint far chance of his being able to undo the one triumphantly impulsive and unreasoning action of his life
7827,696-93314-0057.flac,but it's your business to know that they wouldn't pass a man with a heart like mine i don't know they're not so particular just now they want men i should try it if i were you if you don't have a complete change you'll go all to pieces
7828,696-93314-0045.flac,with the eyes of his memory on the white face of the man he had stabbed now the lover and the onlooker had each his own burden to bear and the lovers was the easier he worked still though there was now nothing to work for more
7829,696-93314-0060.flac,and himself answered him liar you have not done your best you will have to eat your lie yes though it will smash your life and ruin you socially and professionally you will have to tell him you lied and tell him why
7830,696-93314-0054.flac,yes speaking professionally i think you are wrong you lessen your chances of life why don't you try a complete change because if you must know my chances of life have ceased to interest me
7831,696-93314-0061.flac,you will never let him go to south africa without telling him the truth and you know it well you know best i suppose he said to himself but are you perfectly certain
7832,696-93314-0043.flac,her eyes had blue marks under them her chin had grown more pointed her nose sharper there was a new line on her forehead and her eyes had changed over the wine he heard from the father that she was pining for the lover who had inherited heart disease
7833,696-93314-0067.flac,i'm certain he wanted you out of the way he wanted you to get killed oh how can people be so cruel
7834,696-93314-0065.flac,i don't mean that i know you're all right thank god oh thank god i mean don't you think he may have lied to you to prevent your marrying me
7835,696-93314-0059.flac,and when he had done what he could he saw that the lover might not find it out might be passed for the army might go to the front might be killed and then well i've done my best anyhow he said to himself
7836,696-93314-0052.flac,but there are some acts that there is no undoing and the hell that had burned in his heart so fiercely when he had seen her in the other man's arms burned now with new bright lights and infernal flickering flame tongues and at last out of hell
7837,696-93314-0048.flac,and sometimes the dreams got out of hand and carried him a thousand worlds from all that lay between them then he had to wake up and that was bad but the onlooker was no dreamer and he saw her about three times a week
7838,696-93314-0047.flac,like that of scratching a sore in the thought that she was as wretched as he was that divided in all else they were yet united in their suffering he thought it made him more miserable to know of her misery but it didn't he never saw her but he dreamed of her
7839,696-93314-0053.flac,the onlooker reached out his hands and caught at prayer he caught at it as a drowning man catches at a white gleam in the black of the surging sea about him it may be a painted spar it may be empty foam the onlooker prayed
7840,696-93314-0055.flac,the lover was short with the onlooker but he persisted well if one isn't interested in one's life one may be interested in one's death or the manner of it in your place i should enlist
7841,696-93314-0066.flac,why should he he asked me to marry him three weeks ago he's a very old friend of ours i do hate to be suspicious but it is odd and then he's trying to get you to south africa
7842,696-93314-0044.flac,i suppose it was you who saw him by the way said he a tall well set up young fellow dark not bad looking i i don't remember lied the onlooker
7843,696-93314-0062.flac,ye'll mak a fine soldier my lad i think not said the lover and he went out from the presence this time he reeled like a man too drunk to care how drunk he looks he drove in cabs from harley street to wimple street
7844,696-93314-0032.flac,what did he die of for the answer was heart and in it the devil rose and showed the onlooker the really only true and artistic way to develop the action in this situation so dramatic in its possibilities
7845,696-93314-0006.flac,and it forbids a man with an income of a hundred and fifty a year to speak of love to a girl who is reckoned in heiress there are plenty who transgress the code but they are in all the other stories
7846,696-93314-0017.flac,he didn't he accepted it with his arms round her and his lips against the face where the tears now ran warm and salt it was one of the immortal moments the picture was charming too
7847,696-93314-0028.flac,the young man made a reverent note of the name and the interview seemed played out it's a complicated nuisance the father mused it isn't even as if i knew anything of the chap i oughtn't to have allowed the child to make these long visits to her aunt
7848,696-93314-0016.flac,oh how could you of course a really honorable young man
7849,696-93314-0035.flac,no office in the world would ensure you and so it was all over the dreams the hopes the palpitating faith in a beautiful future his days might be long they might be brief but be his life long or short he must live it alone
7850,696-93314-0037.flac,she said why you want me more than ever but i may die at any moment so may i and you may live to be a hundred i'll take my chance
7851,696-93314-0027.flac,he only consented to a provisional engagement took an earnest interest in the young man's affairs and offered to make his daughter an annual allowance on her marriage at my death she will have more he said
7852,696-93314-0023.flac,and called on her father to explain his position and set forth his prospects his coming was heralded by a letter from her one must not quote it it is not proper to read other people's letters especially letters to a trusted father from a child only and adored
7853,696-93314-0020.flac,it's got to be born i suppose he said like all the rest of it she's happy enough i ought to be glad anyway i can't stop it perhaps he swore a little
7854,696-93314-0031.flac,one thing he ought to be able to remember those pretty vividly the confounded pup the onlooker had never done anything wronger than you have done my good reader and he never expected to meet a giant temptation any more than you do
7855,696-93314-0009.flac,and though he had denied himself the joy of speaking in words he had let his eyes speak more than he knew and now he had reached the wallflowers high up and was plucking them and throwing them down so that they fell in a wavering bright shower round her feet
7856,696-93314-0000.flac,the two were alone in the grassy courtyard of the ruined castle the rest of the picnic party had wandered away from them or they from it out of the green grown mound of fallen masonry by the corner of the chapel a great may bush grew
7857,696-93314-0011.flac,no he was hanging by his hands above the great refectory arch and his body swung heavily with the impetus of the checked fall he was moving along now slowly hanging by his hands now he grasped an ivy root another
7858,696-93314-0030.flac,but i don't see how to develop the action it really is rather amusing that i i should have to tap his beastly chest and listen to his cursed lungs and ask sympathetic questions about his idiotic infant illnesses
7859,696-93314-0004.flac,oh don't she cried i don't really want them please not i wish then she stopped because he was already some twelve feet from the ground and she knew that one should not speak to a man who as climbing ruined walls
7860,696-93314-0033.flac,the illuminative flash of temptation was so sudden so brilliant that the doctor onlooker closed his soul's eyes and yielded without even the least pretence of resistance he took his stethoscope from the table
7861,696-93314-0014.flac,don't he said tenderly don't worry it's all right i was a fool pull yourself together there's some one coming i don't care she said
7862,696-93314-0024.flac,its effect may be indicated briefly it showed the father that the girl's happiness had had two long years in which to learn to grow round the thought of the young man whom he now faced for the first time odd
7863,696-93314-0039.flac,but you can't give me up if i won't be given up can you his smile struck her dumb it was more convincing than his words
7864,696-93314-0021.flac,if he did the less precise and devotional may pardon him he had loved the girl since her early teens and it was only yesterday's post that had brought him the appointment that one might marry on the appointment had come through her father
7865,696-93314-0040.flac,you'll forgive me won't you i didn't know and oh what's the use of talking yet they talked for hours conventionally he should have torn himself away unable to bear the strain of his agony
7866,696-93314-0015.flac,for the touch of his cheek pressed against her hair told her all that she wanted to know let them come i don't care oh how could you be so silly and horrid
7867,696-93314-0003.flac,do you want some he said and on the instant his hand had found a strong jutting stone his foot a firm ledge and she saw his figure gray flannel against grey stone go up the wall towards the yellow flowers
7868,696-93314-0002.flac,they shine like gold she said
7869,696-93314-0029.flac,but as uncomfortable as toothache all the same he had another caller that afternoon he whom we know as the onlooker came to thank him for the influence that had got him the appointment as doctor to the influential insurance company the father opened his heart to the onlooker
7870,696-93314-0041.flac,as a matter of fact he sat by her holding her hand it was for the last time the last last time there was really a third at that interview the onlooker had imagination enough to see the scene between the parting lovers
7871,696-93314-0022.flac,the lover who came to his love over strewn wallflowers desired always as has been seen to act up to his moral ideas so he took next day a much earlier train than was at all pleasant
7872,696-93314-0019.flac,he turned away and went back along the green path with hell in his heart the other two were in paradise the onlooker felt like the third in eden the serpent in fact two miles away he stopped and lit a pipe
7873,696-93314-0012.flac,and pulled himself up till his knee was on the moulding of the arch she would never have believed any one who had told her that only two minutes had been lived between the moment of his stumble and the other moment when his foot touched the grass
7874,696-93314-0005.flac,had loved him these two years had loved him since the day of their first meeting and that was just as long as he had loved her but he had never told his love there is a code of honor right or wrong
7875,696-93314-0013.flac,caught him by the arms just above the elbow shook him angrily as one shakes a naughty child looked him once in the eyes and buried her face in his neck sobbing long dry breathless sobs even then he tried to be strong
7876,696-93314-0026.flac,and the lover was received as though that letter were a charm to insure success a faulty or at least a slow working charm however for the father did not lift a bag of gold from his safe and say take her take this also be happy
7877,696-93314-0038.flac,oh don't you see too that if there is only a little time we ought to spend it together it's impossible he said it's no good i must set my teeth in bear it and you i hope it won't be as hard for you as it will for me
7878,696-93314-0018.flac,a picture to wring the heart of the onlooker with envy or sympathy according to his nature but there was only one onlooker a man of forty or thereabouts who paused for an instant under the great gate of the castle and took in the full charm and meaning of the scene
7879,696-93314-0036.flac,he had a little fight with himself as he went down whimpole street then he hailed a hansom and went and told her father who quite agreed with him that it was all over the father wondered at himself for being more sorry than glad
7880,696-93314-0010.flac,there was no sound at all but the grating of his feet as he set them on the stones and the movement now and then of a bird in the ivy then came a rustle a gritty clouder loud falling stones his foot had slipped and he had fallen
7881,696-93314-0025.flac,for to the father he seemed just like other young men it seemed to him that there were so many more of the same pattern from whom she might have chosen and many of them well off too however the letter lay in the prosperous pocket book and the breast of the father's frockcoat
7882,696-93314-0001.flac,silvered an pearled on every scented still spray the sky was deep clear strong blue above and against the blue the wallflowers shone bravely from the cracks and crevices of ruined arch and wall and buttress
7883,696-93314-0034.flac,he walked with more than his ordinary firmness of gait as a man does who is just drunk enough to know that he must try to look sober he walked down the street certain words ringing in his ears heart affected probably hereditary weakness
7884,696-93314-0007.flac,he drove his passion on the curb and mastered it yet the questions does she love me does she know i love her does she wonder why i don't speak and the counter questions will she think i don't care
7885,696-93314-0008.flac,when we let our emotions play the primitive games with us but always the morning brought strength to keep to his resolution he saw her three times a year when christmas easter and midsummer brought her to stay with an aunt brought him home to his people for holidays
7886,8629-261140-0018.flac,in case my presence in this house of death should become known
7887,8629-261140-0049.flac,she did not endeavour to make any corrections in her former testimony only acknowledging that the flower whose presence on the scene of death had been such a mystery had fallen from her hair at the ball and that she had seen frederick pick it up and put it in his button hole
7888,8629-261140-0028.flac,and seeing my way perfectly in the moonlight entered the room on the left the door of which also stood open it was the second house i had entered unannounced that night and in this as in the other
7889,8629-261140-0021.flac,and flung it wildly from the window then i lifted her and laid her where you found her on the sofa
7890,8629-261140-0036.flac,startled the crowd and gave sweetwater already suffering under shock after shock of mingled surprise and wonder
7891,8629-261140-0008.flac,and when i saw by her clearing brow and peaceful look that i had fully persuaded her of this i let her speak what words she would and tell as she was able
7892,8629-261140-0031.flac,i hastened away and took the shortest path home had i been more of a man or if my visit to missus webb had been actuated by a more communicable motive i would have gone at once to the good man who believed me to be of his own flesh and blood
7893,8629-261140-0050.flac,beyond this the inferences it afterward awakened in her mind she would not go
7894,8629-261140-0037.flac,and that something besides justice had actuated amabel in her treatment of this young man this feeling was shared by others and a reaction set in in frederick's favor which even affected the officials who were conducting the inquiry
7895,8629-261140-0027.flac,but i did not turn away remembering my mother's anxiety an anxiety so extreme it disturbed her final moments i approached the front door and was about to knock when i found it open greatly astonished i at once passed in
7896,8629-261140-0016.flac,she pointed to the dagger in her breast but before i could lay my hand upon it she called for batsy i want her to hear me declare before i go said she that this stroke was delivered by myself upon myself
7897,8629-261140-0011.flac,she enjoined me not to enlighten him now if by any sacrifice on my part i could rightfully avoid it that she was happy in having me hear the truth before she died that the joy which this gave her was so great
7898,8629-261140-0041.flac,she rose with a bound nogt that she had anticipated had occurred facts of which she could know nothing had changed the aspect of affairs and made the position of frederick something so remote from any she could have imagined
7899,8629-261140-0005.flac,and she prized every moment remaining to her because of the bliss she enjoyed of seeing
7900,8629-261140-0013.flac,and she made me promise i would care for him to the last with tenderness saying that i would be able to do this without seeming impropriety since she had willed me all her fortune under this proviso finally
7901,8629-261140-0010.flac,and under circumstances calculated to deceive mister sutherland consequently he had never known i was not his own child
7902,8629-261140-0035.flac,would thus be lost you see i had not calculated on miss amabel page
7903,8629-261140-0014.flac,and though her strength and breath were fast failing her she made me understand that she was worried about the zabels who had not come according to a sacred custom between them to celebrate the anniversary of her wedding
7904,8629-261140-0046.flac,not even for his money for she could contemplate his loss but for himself who had so boldly shown that he was stronger than she and could triumph over her by the sheer force of his masculine daring
7905,8629-261140-0026.flac,but as i hastened on toward the quarter where the zabels lived i was seized by such a compunction for his desolate state that i faltered in my rapid flight and did not arrive at the place in my destination as quickly as i intended when i did
7906,8629-261140-0047.flac,with such feelings
7907,8629-261140-0001.flac,seeing this and realizing his opportunity frederick at once entered into the explanations for which each heart there panted this will be overwhelming news to him who has cared for me since infancy
7908,8629-261140-0007.flac,transformed me in an instant from a selfish brute into a deeply repentant man i knelt before her in anguish i made her feel as wicked as i had been i was not
7909,8629-261140-0042.flac,that she was still in the maze of the numberless conflicting emotions which these revelations were calculated to call out in one who had risked all on the hazard of a dieand lost she did not even know at this moment whether she was glad or sorry he could explain so cleverly
7910,8629-261140-0017.flac,but when i rose to look for batsy i found that the shock of her mistress's fatal act had killed her
7911,8629-261140-0040.flac,when he was allowed to resume his seat
7912,8629-261140-0015.flac,and prayed me to see the two old gentlemen before i slept since nothing but death or dire distress would have kept them from gratifying the one whim of my father's failing mind i promised
7913,8629-261140-0043.flac,she had not a pure enough heart to do so to her all self sacrifice was an anomaly no woman of the mental or physical strength of agatha webb would plant a dagger in her own breast just to prevent another person from committing a crime
7914,8629-261140-0009.flac,it is a sacred story to me and if you must know it let it be from her own words in the letter she left behind her she only told me that to save me from the fate of the children who had preceded me
7915,8629-261140-0025.flac,and of how one of them james by name came to be involved in this affair when i left my dead mother's side i was in such a state of mind that i passed with scarcely so much as a glance the room where my new found father sat sleeping
7916,8629-261140-0045.flac,yet how thrilling it had been to hear him plead his cause so well it was almost worth the loss of her revenge to meet his look of hate and dream of the possibility of turning it later into the old look of love yes yes she loved him now
7917,8629-261140-0019.flac,for fear it would make her last moments miserable
7918,8629-261140-0002.flac,you have heard him call me son with what words shall i overthrow his confidence in the truth and restitute of his long buried wife and make him know in his old age that he has wasted years of patience upon one who was not of his blood
7919,8629-261140-0000.flac,and gradually subside so this crowd yielded to its awe and man by man sank back into his seat till quiet was again restored and only a circle of listening faces confronted the man who had just stirred a whole roomful to its depths
7920,8629-261140-0033.flac,in which i found myself placed but the memory of a thousand past ingratitudes together with the knowledge of the shock which he could not fail to receive on learning at this late day
7921,8629-261140-0039.flac,they but emphasized facts already known and produce but little change in the general feeling
7922,8629-261140-0022.flac,james zabel much less that it bore his initials on the handle he paused and the awe occasione by the scene he had described was so deep and a silence so prolonged that a shudder passed over the whole assemblage
7923,8629-261140-0023.flac,when from some unknown quarter a single cutning voice arose in this one short mocking comment oh the fairy tale was it amabel who spoke some thought so and looked her way
7924,8629-261140-0020.flac,but was too terrified to move her speak and this satisfied my mother and made her last breath one of trust and contented love she died as i drew the dagger from her breast
7925,8629-261140-0044.flac,were he lover husband or son so amabel believed and so would these others believe also when once relieved of the magnetic personality of his extraordinary witness
7926,8629-261140-0048.flac,how conduct herself under questions which would be much more searching now than before she could not even decide in her own mind she must let impulse have its way happily she took the right stand at first
7927,8629-261140-0003.flac,or lineage the wonder the incredulity you manifest are my best excuse for my long delay in revealing the secret entrusted to me by this dying woman an owed silence greeted these words
7928,8629-261140-0030.flac,as i did so he gave a sigh but did not wake
7929,8629-261140-0006.flac,the love the passion
7930,8629-261140-0024.flac,as if begging pardon for the wicked doubts which had driven him to this defence frederick met that look with one so severe partook of harshness then resuming his testimony he said
7931,8629-261140-0032.flac,and told him of the strange and heartrending adventure which had changed the whole tenor of my thoughts an life
7932,8629-261140-0034.flac,was neither of her blood nor his rose up between us and caused me not only to attempt silence but to secrete in the adjoining woods the money i had received in the vain hope that all visible connections between myself and my mother's tragic death
7933,8629-261140-0012.flac,she did not regret her fatal act violent and uncalled for as it was for it had showed her my heart and allowed me to read hers
7934,8629-261140-0038.flac,frederick himself felt the change and showed it by the look of relief and growing confidence he cast at agnes of the questions and answers which now passed between him and the various members of the jury i need give no account
7935,8629-261140-0029.flac,i encountered a man sitting asleep by the table it was john the elder of the two and perceiving that he was suffering for food and in a condition of extreme misery i took out the first bill my hand encountered
7936,8629-261140-0004.flac,the astounding fact which i have just communicated to you was made known by my mother with a dagger still plunged in her breast she would not let me draw it out she knew that death would follow that act
7937,8629-261139-0013.flac,he had not meant to yield but now that the moment had come now that he must at once and forever choose between a course that led simply to personal unhappiness and one that involved not only himself
7938,8629-261139-0000.flac,all the witnesses who had anything to say had long ago given in their testimony and when at or near noon
7939,8629-261139-0050.flac,which made any attempt seem reasonable that promised relief from the unendurable burden of appressing and disresputable debt i was obliged to have money a great deal of money and i have to have it at once
7940,8629-261139-0021.flac,every one was astounded no one had expected anything from him and instinctively every eye turned towards amabel to see how she was affected by his action strangely evidently
7941,8629-261139-0010.flac,and the few final minutes before noon passed by without any addition being made to the facts which had already been presented for general consideration as the witness sat down the clock began to strike as the slow
7942,8629-261139-0005.flac,and glanced at the great door of entrance with an evil expectancy that startled even sweetwater so little had he really understood the nature of the passions labouring in that venomous breast
7943,8629-261139-0034.flac,on every face in every shrinking form in subdued murmurs and open cries he read instant and complete condemnation and yet in all his life from boyhood to up to this hour never had he been so worthy of their esteem and consideration
7944,8629-261139-0008.flac,from which he had removed the ring which up to this hour he had invariably worn on his third finger in this glance of hers and this action of his began the struggle that was to make the day memorable in many hearts
7945,8629-261139-0028.flac,did frederick move forward the moment was intense the coroner seemed to share the universal excitement
7946,8629-261139-0040.flac,she was too good it's all calumny a wretched lie broke into unrestrained excitement from every part of the large room in vain the coroner smote with his gavel in vain the local police endeavored to restore order
7947,8629-261139-0064.flac,if you want my money take it if you want my life
7948,8629-261139-0069.flac,and i in scarcely better case fell also this as god lives is the truth concerning the wound found in the breast of this never to be forgotten women the feeling the pathos the anguish even to be found in his tone made this story
7949,8629-261139-0032.flac,was almost appalling in his intensity had it not been for the consciousness of mister sutherland's near presence the feeling would have risen to outbreak and many voices were held in subjection by the remembrance of this venerated man's last look
7950,8629-261139-0016.flac,and had almost touched his finger in the significant action of ascent which amabel awaited with breathless expectation when was it miracle or only the suggestion of his better nature
7951,8629-261139-0044.flac,was the firm response then gentleman continued frederick still without looking at amabel whose smile had acquire mockery that drew the eyes of the jury towards her move than once during the following recital
7952,8629-261139-0023.flac,said that gentleman after exchanging a few hurried words with mister courtney and the surprised knap you can do no better than give it to us at once mister frederick sutherland will you take the stand
7953,8629-261139-0060.flac,lay in the generosity of this great hearted woman and if out of pusilanimity
7954,8629-261139-0045.flac,you know and the public generally now know that missus webb had left me the greater portion of the money of which she died possessed i have never before acknowledged to any one not even to the good man who awaits the jury's verdict
7955,8629-261139-0051.flac,as i had been told early in the evening a small entertainment was being given which would insure its being open even at so late an hour as midnight miss page who will i am sure pardon the introduction of her name into this narrative
7956,8629-261139-0006.flac,smiled as she met his eye with that curious slow dipping of her dimples which had more than once confounded the coroner and rendered her at once the admiration and abhorrence of the crowd
7957,8629-261139-0020.flac,when frederick leaping with a bound to his feet drew all eyes towards himself with the cry let me be put on my oath i have testimony to give of the utmost importance of this case the coroner was astounded
7958,8629-261139-0025.flac,go he whispered but in so thrilling a tone it was heard to the remotest corner of the room spare me the anguish of saying what i have to say in your presence i could not bear it you could not bear it later
7959,8629-261139-0046.flac,on the other side of that door yonder that she had reasons for this good reasons reasons of which up to the very evening of her death
7960,8629-261139-0066.flac,give then i want hundreds thousands now now to save myself disgrace shame prison await me if i don't have them give give and my hand went out toward it not toward her
7961,8629-261139-0075.flac,do these words this action of heirs seem incredible to you sir alas alas they will not when i tell you and here he cast one anxious deeply anxious glance at the room in which mister sutherland was hidden
7962,8629-261139-0052.flac,has taken pains to declare to you that in the expedition she herself made into town that evening she followed some persons step down hill this is very likely true and though steps were probably mine for after leaving the house by the garden door
7963,8629-261139-0011.flac,hesitating strokes rang out sweetwater saw frederick yield to a sudden but most profound emotion the old fear which we understand it sweetwater did not had again seized the victim of amabel's ambition
7964,8629-261139-0036.flac,he withstood the clamour and began speaking again before the coroner had been able to fully restore quiet i know said he
7965,8629-261139-0022.flac,ever forgot though it conveyed no hint of her real feelings which were somewhat chaotic frederick who had forgotten her now that he had made up his mind to speak waited for the coroner's reply if you have testimony
7966,8629-261139-0002.flac,he soon recognized that his own judgment was not at fault and that notwithstanding outward appearances and the languid interest shown in the now lagging proceedings
7967,8629-261139-0053.flac,and so hastened on till i came to the gate on high street here i had a moment of hesitation and thoughts bitter enough for me to recall them at this moment came into my mind
7968,8629-261139-0038.flac,doctor talbot and you gentlemen of the jury in the face of god and man i here declare that missus webb in my presence and before my eyes
7969,8629-261139-0007.flac,looked away as soon as possible
7970,8629-261139-0031.flac,and the shock the surprise
7971,8629-261139-0059.flac,of whose mental condition i was well aware that i could not bring myself to make any loud noise within his hearing yet i had not the courage to retreat all my hope of relief from the many difficulties that menaced me
7972,8629-261139-0004.flac,for while she had hitherto sat under the universal gaze with only the faint smile of conscious beauty on her inscrutable features
7973,8629-261139-0061.flac,nothing but shame and disaster awaited me yet how could i hope to lure her downstairs without noise i could not and so yielding to the impulse of the moment without any realization
7974,8629-261139-0054.flac,but they passed thank god and with no more desperate feeling than a sullen intention of having my own way about this money i lifted the latch of the front door and stepped in
7975,8629-261139-0047.flac,or that i was the special object of her attention or that we were under any mutual obligations in any way why than i should have thought of going to her in the great strait in which i found myself on that day
7976,8629-261139-0074.flac,there are five hundred dollars in that table take them and let them prave your way to a better life
7977,8629-261139-0063.flac,for she rose and meeting my eye with a gaze in which shock and some strange and poignant agony totally incomprehensible to me were strangely blended she cried out no no frederick you don't know what you are doing
7978,8629-261139-0071.flac,what i must now explain is how the money in missus webb's drawer came into my possession and how the dagger she had planted in her breast came to be found on the lawn outside when i came to myself and that must have been very soon i found
7979,8629-261139-0062.flac,i slipped up the narrow staircase
7980,8629-261139-0037.flac,but if any one who listens to me thinks me guilty of the death i was so unfortunate as to have witnessed
7981,8629-261139-0039.flac,gave to herself the blow which has robbed us all of a most valuable life she was not murdered it was a solemn assertion but it failed to convince the crowd before him as by one impulse men and women broke into a tumult
7982,8629-261139-0009.flac,and to him a full attention was being given in the hope that some real enlightenment would come at last to settle the questions which had been raised by amabel's incomplete and unsatisfactory testimony but no man can furnish what he does not possess
7983,8629-261139-0017.flac,the memory of a face full of holy pleading rose from the past before his eyes and with an inner cry of mother he flung his hand out and clutched his father's arm in a way to break the charm of his own dread
7984,8629-261139-0057.flac,i saw the master of the house with his head sunk forward on his arms asleep the expected guests had failed to arrive and he tired out with waiting had fallen into a doze at the board
7985,8629-261139-0076.flac,that unknown to me unknown to any one living but herself unknown to the good man from whom it can no longer be kept hidden agatha webb was my mother
7986,8629-261139-0015.flac,which only comes from years of self control were too lately awakened in his breast to sustain him now as stroke after stroke fell on the ear he felt himself yielding beyond recovery
7987,8629-261139-0003.flac,but vital consequence frederick was not visible in the great hall but that he was near at hand soon became evident from the change sweetwater now saw in amabel
7988,8629-261139-0065.flac,don't stain yours don't i did not understand her i did not know until i thought it over afterward that my hand was thrust convulsively into my breast in a way which taken with my wild mien
7989,8629-261139-0055.flac,or at least to hear the sound of merry voices and laughter in the rooms above but no sound of any sort awaited me indeed the house seemed strangely silent for one so fully lighted and astonished at this
7990,8629-261139-0072.flac,that the blow of which i had been such a horrified witness had not yet proved fatal the eyes i had seen close as i had supposed for ever were now open and she was looking at me with a smile that has never left my memory and never will
7991,8629-261139-0041.flac,the tide was up and overswept everything for an instant
7992,8629-261139-0049.flac,and quite capable of doing a very unselfish act still this would not seem to be reason enough for me to intrude upon her late at night with a plea for a large loan of money had i not been in a desperate condition of mind
7993,8629-261139-0042.flac,of amabel smoothing out the folds of her crisp white frock with an incredulous almost insulting smile that at once fixed attention again on frederick he seized the occasion and spoke up in a tone of great resolve
7994,8629-261139-0018.flac,and and forever the effects of intolerable fascination that was working upon him next minute the last stroke of noon rang out and the hour was up which amabel had set as the limit of her silence a pause
7995,8629-261139-0019.flac,which to their two hearts if to no other seemed strangely appropriate followed the cessation of these sounds then the witness was dismissed and amabel
7996,8629-261139-0035.flac,he did not lose his determined attitude he had observed a change in amabel and a change in agnes and if only to disappoint the vile triumph of the one
7997,8629-261139-0073.flac,there is no blood on you she murmured you did not strike the blow
7998,8629-261139-0012.flac,with a fell and steady purpose he found his right hand stealing toward the left in the significant action she expected better to yield than fall headlong into the pit one word of hers would open
7999,8629-261139-0070.flac,seemed appear for the moment plausible and batsy asked the coroner must have fallen when we did for i never heard her voice after the first scream but i shall speak of her again
8000,8629-261139-0026.flac,if you will wait for me in one of these rooms i will repeat my tale in your ears but go now it is my last entreaty there was a silence no one ventured a descent
8001,8629-261139-0030.flac,infinitely more than anyone they had expected
8002,8629-261139-0024.flac,with the noble air from which all hesitation had vanished frederick started towards the place indicated but stopped before he had taken a half dozen steps
8003,8629-261139-0014.flac,but those dearest to him in disgrace and sorrow he felt himself weakened to the point of clutching it whatever would save him from the consequences of confession moral strength and that tenacity of purpose
8004,8629-261139-0067.flac,but she mistook the action mistook my purpose and
8005,8629-261139-0027.flac,no one so much as made a gesture of disapproval then mister sutherland struggled to his feet cast one last look around him and disappeared through a door which had opened like magic before him then and not till then
8006,8629-261139-0058.flac,this was a condition of things for which i was not prepared missus webb whom i wished to see was probably upstairs and while i might summon her by a sturdy wrap on the door beside which i stood i had so little desire to wake her husband
8007,8629-261139-0068.flac,more than the outward seeming of her life can hardly measure plunged against it and i can tell you no more her blood and batsy's shriek from the adjoining room swam through my consciousness and then she fell as i supposed
8008,8629-261139-0033.flac,that otherwise would have made themselves heard in despite of the restrictions of the place and the authority of the police to frederick it was a moment of immeasurable grief and humiliation
8009,8629-261139-0029.flac,this you will believe when i tell you that i was the person miss page followed into miss webb's house and whom she heard descend the stairs during the moment she crouched behind the figure of the sleeping philamon it was more
8010,8629-261139-0043.flac,i have made an assertion said he before god and before this jury to make it seem a credible one i shall have to tell my own story from the beginning am i allowed to do so mister coroner you are
8011,8629-261139-0056.flac,i pushed the door ajar at my left and looked in an unexpected and pitiful sight awaited me
8012,8629-261139-0001.flac,it was to find in two faces only any signs of the eagerness and expectancy which filled his own breast to suffocation but as these faces were those of agnes haliday and amabel page
8013,8629-261139-0048.flac,i cannot say i knew she had money in her house this i had unhappily been made acquainted with in an accidental way
8014,1235-135887-0017.flac,but as he treated all his court that day made him eat at his table alone with him
8015,1235-135887-0016.flac,bowed himself before the throne with his face to the ground the king perceiving him made him sit down by his side presented him to the assembly and gave him all the commendation he deserved
8016,1235-135887-0008.flac,and after a profound reverence said to the king he judged it meet that his majesty should take horse
8017,1235-135887-0026.flac,if he had had a design upon my life why did he save me then he needed only to have left me to my disease i could not have escaped it as life was fast decaying forbear then to fill me with unjust suspicions
8018,1235-135887-0015.flac,and showed himself to his courtiers who eager to know the success of the new medicine came thither betimes and when they saw the king perfectly cured expressed great joy
8019,1235-135887-0007.flac,with which next morning he presented himself before the king and falling down at his feet kissed the ground
8020,1235-135887-0021.flac,to effect this he went to the king and told him in private that he had some information of the greatest consequence to communicate the king having asked what it was sire said he
8021,1235-135887-0003.flac,i know said he after the usual ceremonials that your majesty's physicians have not been able to heal you of the leprosy but if you will accept my service i will engage to cure you without potions
8022,1235-135887-0018.flac,but caused him to be clad in a rich robe
8023,1235-135887-0010.flac,when the medicine i have put up in the handle of the mace is heated with your hand it will penetrate your whole body and as soon as you perspire you may leave off the exercise
8024,1235-135887-0025.flac,i am certain that this physician whom you suspect to be a villain and a traitor is one of the best and most virtuous of men you know by what medicine or rather by what miracle he cured me of my leprosy
8025,1235-135887-0011.flac,immediately on your return to your palace go into the bath and cause yourself to be well washed and rubbed then retire to bed and when you rise to morrow you will find yourself cured
8026,1235-135887-0031.flac,after having represented to king sindbad that he ought to beware lest on the accusation of a mother in law he should commit an action of which he might afterwards repent
8027,1235-135887-0014.flac,the next morning when he arose he perceived with equal wonder and joy that his leprosy was cured and his body as clean as if it had never been affected as soon as he was dressed he came into the hall of audience where he ascended his throne
8028,1235-135887-0028.flac,i should never pay him sufficiently for what he has done i perceive it to be his virtue that raises your envy but do not think i will be unjustly prejudiced against him i remember too well what a vizier said to king sindbad his master
8029,1235-135887-0012.flac,the king took the mace and struck the ball which was returned by his officers who played with him he played so long that his hands and his whole body were in a sweat and then the medicine shut up in the handle of the mace had its operation
8030,1235-135887-0005.flac,do you assure me that you will cure my leprosy without potion or applying any external medicine yes sire replied the physician i promise myself success through god's assistance
8031,1235-135887-0022.flac,it is highly dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose fidelity he has never tried
8032,1235-135887-0006.flac,and to morrow with your majesty's permission i will make the trial the physician returned to his quarters made a hollow mace and at the handle he put in his drugs
8033,1235-135887-0020.flac,he could not behold without envy the presents that were given to the physician whose other merits had already begun to make him jealous
8034,1235-135887-0024.flac,and came to settle himself at your court for the sole purpose of executing the horrible design which i have intimated no no vizier interrupted the king
8035,1235-135887-0027.flac,instead of listening to you i tell you that from this day forward i will give that great man a pension of a thousand pieces of gold per month for his life nay though i were to share with him all my riches and dominions
8036,1235-135887-0013.flac,as the physician had said upon this the king left off play returned to his palace entered the bath and observed very exactly his physician had proscribed to him
8037,1235-135887-0029.flac,to prevent his putting to death the prince his son what the grecian king said about king sindibad raised the vizier's curiosity who said i pray your majesty to pardon me
8038,1235-135887-0002.flac,arrived at his court this physician had learnt the theory of his profession in greek persian turkish arabic latin syraic and hebrew books he was an experienced natural philosopher
8039,1235-135887-0030.flac,if i have the boldness to ask what the vizier of king sidbad said to his master to divert him from putting the prince his son to death the grecian king had the condescension to satisfy him that vizier said he
8040,1235-135887-0009.flac,the king did so and when he arrived there the physician came to him with the mace and said exercise yourself with this mace and strike the ball until you find your hands and body perspire
8041,1235-135887-0023.flac,i am well informed of what i have had the honor to reveal to your majesty therefore do not rest in dangerous security if your majesty be asleep be pleased to awake
8042,1235-135887-0004.flac,or external applications the king listened to what he said and answered if you be able to perform what you promise i will enrich you and your posterity
8043,1235-135887-0019.flac,continued every day to load him with new favours but this king had a vizier who was avaricious envious and naturally capable of every kind of mischief
8044,1235-135887-0000.flac,the story of the grecian king
8045,1235-135887-0001.flac,there was in the country of yunan or greece a king who was leperous and his physicians had in vain endeavoured his cure
8046,1235-135884-0020.flac,go said i to the farmer carry home that calf take great care of him and bring me another in his stead immediately as soon as my wife heard me give this order she exclaimed what are you about husband
8047,1235-135884-0038.flac,but in acknowledgment you will make your deliverer your wife as i have promised he joyfully consented but before they married she changed my wife into a hind and this is she whom you see here
8048,1235-135884-0011.flac,and finding myself moved with compassion i could not find in my heart to give her a blow but ordered my farmer to get me another my wife who was present was enraged at my tenderness
8049,1235-135884-0019.flac,i was more surprised and affected with this action than with the tears of the cow i felt a tender pity which interested me on this behalf or rather nature did its duty
8050,1235-135884-0023.flac,when turning his eyes bathed with tears in a languishing manner towards me he affected me so much that i had not strength to kill him i let the knife fall and told my wife positively
8051,1235-135884-0033.flac,provided you first of all restore to me my son
8052,1235-135884-0007.flac,her enmity did not stop at this abominable action but she likewise changed the slave into a cow and gave her also to my farmer at my return i inquired for the mother and child
8053,1235-135884-0024.flac,that i would have another calf to sacrifice and not that she used all her endeavours to persuade me to change my resolution but i continued firm
8054,1235-135884-0015.flac,though she seemed very fat take her yourself said i to him
8055,1235-135884-0009.flac,but as she informed me my son had only disappeared i was in hopes he would shortly return however eight months passed and i heard nothing of him when the festival of the great bairam was to be celebrated
8056,1235-135884-0027.flac,this is what my daughter told me said the farmer and i come to acquaint you with it i leave you to judge how much i was surprised i went immediately to my farmer to speak to his daughter myself
8057,1235-135884-0035.flac,but if thou be a man and art changed into a calf by enchantment return to thy natural shape by the permission of the sovereign creator as she spoke she threw water upon him
8058,1235-135884-0014.flac,i then put the mallet into the farmer's hands and desired him to take it and sacrifice her himself for her tears and bellowing pierced my heart the farmer less compassionate than myself sacrificed her
8059,1235-135884-0031.flac,as to what relates to my wife i also agree a person who has been capable of committing such a criminal action justly deserves to be punished
8060,1235-135884-0025.flac,i come said he to communicate to you a piece of intelligence for which i hope you will return me thanks i have a daughter that has some skill in magic yesterday
8061,1235-135884-0005.flac,she however employed that time to satisfy her hatred she applied herself to magic
8062,1235-135884-0040.flac,it being now several years since i heard of him i am come abroad to inquire after him and not being willing to trust anybody with my wife till i should return home i thought fit to take her everywhere with me
8063,1235-135884-0001.flac,we lived together twenty years without any children her barrenness did not affect any change in my love i still treated her with much kindness and affection
8064,1235-135884-0006.flac,the wretch carried my son to a desolate place where by her enchantments she changed him into a calf and gave him to my farmer to fattin pretending she had bought him
8065,1235-135884-0032.flac,only i must pray you not to take her life i am going then answered she to treat her as she treated your son to this i consent said i
8066,1235-135884-0028.flac,as soon as i arrived i went forthwith to the stall where my son was kept he could not return my embraces but received them in such a manner as fully satisfied me he was my son
8067,1235-135884-0000.flac,what is more my wife she was only twelve years of age when i married her so that i may justly say she ought to regard me equally as her father her kinsman and her husband
8068,1235-135884-0012.flac,and resisting an order which disappointed her malice she cried out what are you doing husband sacrifice that cow your farmer has not a finer nor one fitter for the festival out of deference to my wife i came again to the cow
8069,1235-135884-0008.flac,your slave said she is dead and as for your son i know not what is become of him i have not seen him this two months i was afflicted at the death of the slave
8070,1235-135884-0034.flac,pronounced over at words that i did not understand and addressing herself to the calf o calf if thou wast created by the almighty and sovereign master of the world such as thou appearest at this time continue in that form
8071,1235-135884-0016.flac,i did not inquire what he did with the cow but soon after he had taken her away he hadreturned with the fat calf though i knew not the calf was my son yet i could not forbear being moved at the sight of him on his part
8072,1235-135884-0039.flac,i desired she might have this shape rather than another less agreeable that we might see her in the family without honor since that time my son is become a widower and gone to travel
8073,1235-135884-0026.flac,these two metamorphoses were made by the enchantments of our master's wife who hated both the mother
8074,1235-135884-0036.flac,and in an instant he recovered his natural form my son
8075,1235-135884-0003.flac,but concealed her aversion so well that i knew nothing of it till it was too late meantime my son grew up and was ten years old when i was obliged to undertake a long journey
8076,1235-135884-0030.flac,except on two conditions the first is that you give him to me for my husband and the second that you allow me to punish the person who changed him into a calf as to the first i replied
8077,1235-135884-0010.flac,the unfortunate mother of my son i bound her but as i was going to sacrifice her she bellowed piteously and i could perceive tears streaming from her eyes this seemed to me very extraordinary
8078,1235-135884-0018.flac,with his head against the ground as if he meant to excite my compassion conjuring me not to be so cruel as to take his life and did as much as was possible for him to signify that he was my son
8079,1235-135884-0013.flac,and combating my compassion which suspended the sacrifice was going to give her the fatal blow when the victim redoubling her tears and bellowing disarmed me a second time
8080,1235-135884-0004.flac,before i went i recommended to my wife of whom i had no mistrust the slave and her son and prayed her to take care of them during my absence which was to be for a whole year
8081,1235-135884-0029.flac,my good maid said i can you restore my son to his former shape yes she replied i can
8082,1235-135884-0002.flac,my desire of having children only induced me to purchase a slave by whom i had a son who was extremely promising my wife being jealous cherished a hatred for both mother and child
8083,1235-135884-0041.flac,this is the history of myself and this hind is it not one of the most wonderful and surprising i admit it is said the genie and on that account forgive the merchant one third of his crime
8084,1235-135884-0037.flac,with such a transport of joy that i knew not what i was doing it is heaven that hat sent us this young maid to remove the horrible charm by which you were enchanted and to avenge the injury done to you and your mother i doubt not
8085,1235-135884-0022.flac,the wicked woman had no regard to my wishes she hated my son too much to consent that i should save him i tied the poor creature and taking up the fatal knife was going to plunge it into my son's throat
8086,1235-135884-0017.flac,as soon as he beheld me he made so great an effort to come near me that he broke his cord
8087,1235-135884-0021.flac,take my advice sacrifice no other calf but that wife i replied i will not sacrifice him i will spare him and pray do not you oppose me
8088,1235-135883-0027.flac,if you will believe my oath answered the merchant i swear by all that is sacred that i will come and meet you here without fail what time do you require then demanded the genie
8089,1235-135883-0035.flac,the children all in tears made the house resound with their groans and the father not being able to resist the impulse of nature mingled his tears with theirs so that in a word they exhibited the most affecting spectacle possible
8090,1235-135883-0034.flac,he then related what had passed betwixt him and the genie and informed her that he had given him his oath to return at the end of the year to receive death from his hands when they heard this afflicting intelligence they all began to lament in the most distressing manner
8091,1235-135883-0029.flac,to put myself into your hands do you take heaven to be witnessed to this promise said the genie i do answered the merchant and you may rely upon my oath upon this the genie left him near the fountain and disappeared
8092,1235-135883-0025.flac,to bid my wife and children adieu
8093,1235-135883-0013.flac,protested he was innocent bewailed his wife and children and supplicated the genie and the most moving expressions the genie with his cimeter still lifted up had the patience to hear his unfortunate victims to the end of his lamentations
8094,1235-135883-0012.flac,persisting in his resolution i must kill thee since thou hast killed my son then taking the merchant by the arm he threw him with his face on the ground and lifted up his cimeter to cut off his head the merchant with tears
8095,1235-135883-0005.flac,the genie spoke to him in a terrible voice rise that i may kill thee with this cimeter as thou hast killed my son and accompanied these words with a frightful cry
8096,1235-135883-0015.flac,what exclaimed the merchant can nothing prevail with you will you absolutely take away the life of a poor innocent yes replied the genie i am resolved
8097,1235-135883-0038.flac,when however it became necessary for him to tear himself from these dear objects he addressed them in the following terms my dear wife and children i obey the will of heaven in quitting you follow my example
8098,1235-135883-0014.flac,all this whining said the monster is to no purpose
8099,1235-135883-0003.flac,having alighted he tied his horse to a branch and sitting down by the fountain took some biscuits and dates out of his wallet as he ate his dates he threw the shells carelessly in different directions when he had finished his repast
8100,1235-135883-0011.flac,replied the merchant but certainly i never killed your son and if i have it was unknown to me and i did it innocently i beg you therefore to pardon me and suffer me to live no no returned the genie
8101,1235-135883-0006.flac,the merchant being as much alarmed at the hideous shape of the monster as at his threatening language answered him trembling alas my good lord of what crime can i be guilty towards you that you should take away my life
8102,1235-135883-0039.flac,submit with fortitude to this necessity and consider that it is the destiny of man to die having thus spoke he went out of the hearing of the cries of his family and pursuing his journey arrived on the day appointed
8103,1235-135883-0028.flac,i ask a year said the merchant i cannot in less settle my affairs and prepare myself to die without regret but i promise you that this day twelve months i will return under these trees
8104,1235-135883-0022.flac,the sultan without waiting for cheherazade to ask his permission bade her proceed with the story of the genie and the merchant upon which cheherazade continued her relation as follows f n
8105,1235-135883-0041.flac,brother may i ask why you are come into this desert place which is possessed solely by evil spirits and where consequently you cannot be safe from the beautiful trees which are seen here one might indeed suppose the place inhabited
8106,1235-135883-0033.flac,we are all overjoyed said she at your return but you alarm us by your lamentations pray tell us the cause of your sorrow alas replied the husband i have but a year to live
8107,1235-135883-0045.flac,they saw another old man coming towards them followed by two black dogs
8108,1235-135883-0007.flac,demanded the genie did you not take dates out of your wallet
8109,1235-135883-0047.flac,they had scarcely begun to converse together when there arrived a third old man leading a mule he addressed himself to the two former and asked why the merchant who sat with them looked so melancholy they told him the reason
8110,1235-135883-0037.flac,he gave her in addition as much as the law would allow him at last the year expired and he was obliged to depart he put his burial clothes in his wallet but when he came to bid his wife and children adieu their grief surpassed description
8111,1235-135883-0002.flac,the fourth day of his journey he was so much incommoded by the heat of the sun that the reflection of that heat from the earth
8112,1235-135883-0001.flac,because he had a great desert to pass over where he could procure no sorts of provisions he arrived without any incident at the end of his journey and having dispatched his affairs took horse again in order to return home
8113,1235-135883-0023.flac,in the original work scheherazade continually breaks off to ask the sultan to spare her life for another day that she may finish the story she is relating as these interruptions considerably interfere with the continued interest of the stories it has been deemed advisable to omit them
8114,1235-135883-0042.flac,he then seated himself by the merchant and they entered into conversation but i see day said scheherazade and must leave off yet the best of the story is to come the sultan resolving to hear the end of it
8115,1235-135883-0009.flac,and thou didst throw one into his eye which killed him therefore i must kill thee
8116,1235-135883-0016.flac,as soon as she had spoken these words perceiving it was day and knowing that the sultan rose early in the morning to say his prayers and hold his counsel cheherazade discontinued her story dear sister said denarzade
8117,1235-135883-0024.flac,for heaven's sake hold your hand allow me one word
8118,1235-135883-0018.flac,i will wait till to morrow for i can at any time put her to death when she has concluded her story having thus resolved not to put sheherazade to death that day he rose and went to his prayers and to attend his counsel
8119,1235-135883-0044.flac,but the sultan wishing to learn what followed betwixt the merchant and the genie bade her proceed with that which she did as follows sir while the merchant and the old man who led the hind were conversing
8120,1235-135883-0043.flac,suffered her to live that day also the next morning dinarzade made the same request to her sister as before my dear sister said she
8121,1235-135883-0021.flac,the next morning before day dinarzade failed not to call to her sister my dear sister if you be not asleep i pray you till daybreak which is very near to go on with the story you began last night
8122,1235-135883-0048.flac,which appeared to him so extraordinary
8123,1235-135883-0008.flac,i did all that you say answered the merchant i cannot deny it if it be so resumed the genie i tell thee that thou hast killed my son and in this manner when thou wert throwing the shells about my son was passing by
8124,1235-135883-0049.flac,the merchant and the three old men began to lament and fill the air with their cries when the old man who led the hind saw the genie lay hold of the merchant and about to kill him
8125,1235-135883-0019.flac,instead of sleeping he spent the night in sighs and groans bewailing the lot of his daughter of whom he believed he should himself shortly be the executioner as with this melancholy prospect before him he dreaded to meet the sultan
8126,1235-135883-0031.flac,but grieved on the other when he reflected on his fatal oath when he reached home his wife and children received him with all the demonstrations of perfect joy but he instead of returning their caresses wept so bitterly
8127,1235-135883-0050.flac,i will tell you the history of my life and of the hind you see and if you think it more wonderful and surprising than the adventure of the merchant i hope you will pardon the unfortunate man a third of his offence
8128,1235-135883-0030.flac,the merchant being recovered from his terror mounted his horse and proceeded on his journey
8129,1235-135883-0046.flac,the old man with the hind told him the adventure of the merchant and genie with all that had passed between them particularly the merchant's oath
8130,1235-135883-0010.flac,pardon me cried the merchant no pardon exclaimed the genie no mercy is it not just to kill him that has killed another
8131,1235-135883-0020.flac,he was agreeably surprised when he found the prince entered the council chamber without giving him the fatal orders he expected the sultan according to his custom spent the day in regulating his affairs and when the night had closed in retired with scheherazade
8132,1235-135883-0032.flac,that his family apprehended something calamitous had befallen him
8133,1235-135883-0040.flac,an old man leading a hind appeared and drew near him
8134,1235-135883-0000.flac,he was obliged from time to time to visit his correspondence on business and one day being under the necessity of going a long journey on an affair of importance he took horse and carried with him a wallet containing biscuits and dates
8135,1235-135883-0026.flac,that they may not go to law after my death when i have done this i will come back and submit to whatever you shall please to command but said the genie if i grant you the time you ask i doubt you will never return
8136,1235-135883-0036.flac,on the following morning the merchant applied himself to put his affairs in order and first of all to pay his debts he made presents to his friends gave liberal alms to the poor
8137,1235-135883-0017.flac,the remainder of it replied sheherazade is more surprising and you will be of this opinion if the sultan will but permit me to live over this day
8138,1235-135883-0004.flac,being a good musulman he washed his hands face and feet and said his prayers before he had finished and while he was yet on his knees he saw a genie white with age
8139,730-358-0015.flac,sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again
8140,730-358-0027.flac,and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty
8141,730-358-0010.flac,no distinct ideas occupied my mind i was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various sents saluted me
8142,730-358-0008.flac,i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invaded me on all sides i sat down and wept soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure
8143,730-358-0022.flac,i observed this also
8144,730-358-0007.flac,i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night
8145,730-358-0033.flac,i lay down among some straw and fell asleep
8146,730-358-0035.flac,i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village
8147,730-358-0017.flac,my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another
8148,730-358-0052.flac,whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsoled attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently
8149,730-358-0026.flac,when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced
8150,730-358-0023.flac,when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food
8151,730-358-0034.flac,which shone brightly on the white ground
8152,730-358-0004.flac,this was the forest near ingelstat and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i fent tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state
8153,730-358-0018.flac,one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it
8154,730-358-0038.flac,no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain
8155,730-358-0021.flac,and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire
8156,730-358-0002.flac,the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me
8157,730-358-0009.flac,the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak
8158,730-358-0061.flac,the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage and the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures
8159,730-358-0019.flac,in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire
8160,730-358-0045.flac,which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm
8161,730-358-0040.flac,that i might view the adjacent cottage
8162,730-358-0054.flac,the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager
8163,730-358-0032.flac,after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overbecome
8164,730-358-0005.flac,i slacked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened
8165,730-358-0046.flac,and the rain dropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature
8166,730-358-0012.flac,i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage
8167,730-358-0063.flac,did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours
8168,730-358-0003.flac,the light became more and more oppressive to me
8169,730-358-0025.flac,and the nuts and roots much improved
8170,730-358-0051.flac,on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost impereceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate
8171,730-358-0031.flac,his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me
8172,730-358-0011.flac,the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other
8173,730-358-0006.flac,as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate
8174,730-358-0053.flac,who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight
8175,730-358-0058.flac,and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which he placed in water and then upon the fire
8176,730-358-0062.flac,but to my extreme wonder
8177,730-358-0049.flac,and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partially filled with milk as she walked along
8178,730-358-0001.flac,by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose
8179,730-358-0014.flac,and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant root
8180,730-358-0037.flac,refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it
8181,730-358-0024.flac,and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers
8182,730-358-0057.flac,bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage
8183,730-358-0044.flac,by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloin'd and a cup
8184,730-358-0055.flac,he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a particular and overpowering nature
8185,730-358-0041.flac,one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stone and wood
8186,730-358-0060.flac,the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions
8187,730-358-0064.flac,the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds
8188,730-358-0048.flac,her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad
8189,730-358-0016.flac,the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas
8190,730-358-0028.flac,i id struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before
8191,730-358-0036.flac,allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me
8192,730-358-0013.flac,which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals
8193,730-358-0047.flac,with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour
8194,730-358-0029.flac,the appearance was disdiscolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut
8195,730-358-0042.flac,all the light i enjoyed came through the sty
8196,730-358-0039.flac,however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man
8197,730-358-0020.flac,the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried in itself become inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches
8198,730-358-0000.flac,chapter eleven it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original error of my being
8199,730-358-0043.flac,having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeting it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man in a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power
8200,730-358-0030.flac,this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly
8201,730-358-0050.flac,presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand crossd the field behind the cottage
8202,730-358-0056.flac,and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions
8203,730-358-0059.flac,and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots
8204,730-359-0036.flac,to discover myself to the cottagers
8205,730-359-0032.flac,where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believed he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him
8206,730-359-0044.flac,my thoughts now become more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wrench
8207,730-359-0043.flac,and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful
8208,730-359-0020.flac,and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood
8209,730-359-0012.flac,i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood
8210,730-359-0014.flac,the young woman when she opened the door in the morning
8211,730-359-0035.flac,of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour
8212,730-359-0040.flac,and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced the old man leaning on his son
8213,730-359-0008.flac,a considerable period elapsed
8214,730-359-0048.flac,greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation
8215,730-359-0026.flac,agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived
8216,730-359-0011.flac,this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption
8217,730-359-0005.flac,they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable
8218,730-359-0028.flac,but if his countenance was more sorrowful
8219,730-359-0050.flac,my spirits were elevated by the enhancing appearance of nature
8220,730-359-0016.flac,by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds
8221,730-359-0029.flac,especially when he addressed the old man i could mention innumerable instances which although slight
8222,730-359-0025.flac,often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called to them to cast off their melancholy
8223,730-359-0034.flac,that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science
8224,730-359-0033.flac,he read to the old man and agatha this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore
8225,730-359-0017.flac,i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it
8226,730-359-0021.flac,but the old man had only one which was father the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describe the delight i felt
8227,730-359-0015.flac,she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go into the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden
8228,730-359-0007.flac,they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one another's company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply
8229,730-359-0000.flac,i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not
8230,730-359-0024.flac,when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathized in their joys
8231,730-359-0023.flac,as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me
8232,730-359-0046.flac,i imagined that they would be disgusted until
8233,730-359-0031.flac,from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen
8234,730-359-0013.flac,and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days
8235,730-359-0002.flac,this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind
8236,730-359-0009.flac,it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter
8237,730-359-0038.flac,as the sun became warmer and the light of the day longer
8238,730-359-0022.flac,when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them
8239,730-359-0006.flac,it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy
8240,730-359-0010.flac,when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves
8241,730-359-0003.flac,enjoyed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion
8242,730-359-0041.flac,my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends
8243,730-359-0030.flac,in the midst of poverty and want
8244,730-359-0004.flac,and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them
8245,730-359-0001.flac,which influenced their actions the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal
8246,730-359-0047.flac,and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease
8247,730-359-0019.flac,not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however
8248,730-359-0039.flac,from this time felix was more employed and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared
8249,730-359-0045.flac,that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father
8250,730-359-0049.flac,happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before
8251,730-359-0018.flac,but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose
8252,730-359-0042.flac,when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was starlight
8253,730-359-0027.flac,and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appears to have suffered more deeply than his friends
8254,730-359-0037.flac,which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure
8255,730-360-0027.flac,he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors
8256,730-360-0020.flac,the days now passed as peacefully as before with the sole alteration that
8257,730-360-0039.flac,except through means which i obtained by stealth
8258,730-360-0022.flac,in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlit woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and bommy
8259,730-360-0004.flac,that he inquired the cause of the son's sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when some one tapped at the door it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a countryman as a guide
8260,730-360-0008.flac,every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable
8261,730-360-0012.flac,she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend and i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mist
8262,730-360-0005.flac,the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix
8263,730-360-0028.flac,and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth
8264,730-360-0021.flac,and the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors
8265,730-360-0031.flac,and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared
8266,730-360-0043.flac,all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion
8267,730-360-0025.flac,who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me
8268,730-360-0035.flac,united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few
8269,730-360-0003.flac,that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured
8270,730-360-0023.flac,although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight
8271,730-360-0037.flac,sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge
8272,730-360-0015.flac,retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest
8273,730-360-0034.flac,i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood
8274,730-360-0006.flac,on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil
8275,730-360-0026.flac,the book from which felix instructed safe was volnay's ruins of empires i should not have understood the ppurport of this book had not felix in reading it
8276,730-360-0001.flac,it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and vert
8277,730-360-0007.flac,and her complexion wondrously fair
8278,730-360-0000.flac,i now hastened to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been had made me what i am
8279,730-360-0018.flac,when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger
8280,730-360-0024.flac,my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and thti may boast
8281,730-360-0011.flac,and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately
8282,730-360-0019.flac,the old man appeared enraptured and said some words with agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which she appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music
8283,730-360-0013.flac,and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to me that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend
8284,730-360-0036.flac,and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property
8285,730-360-0040.flac,miserable unhappy wrench other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply
8286,730-360-0014.flac,presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end
8287,730-360-0016.flac,was the subject of their conversation i ardiently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible the next morning felix went out to his work
8288,730-360-0002.flac,my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar
8289,730-360-0033.flac,or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of the vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me
8290,730-360-0041.flac,how the father doted on the smiles of the infant
8291,730-360-0017.flac,and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes
8292,730-360-0029.flac,degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere
8293,730-360-0042.flac,no mother had blessed me with smiles or caresses
8294,730-360-0010.flac,she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage
8295,730-360-0009.flac,she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes
8296,730-360-0038.flac,and that was death a state of which i feared yet did not understand
8297,730-360-0030.flac,inhabitants these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base
8298,730-360-0032.flac,a condition more abject an that
8299,730-360-0044.flac,i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i
8300,83-9960-0044.flac,ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone
8301,83-9960-0026.flac,finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious tone
8302,83-9960-0024.flac,was safe while his exasperated wife vociferated
8303,83-9960-0029.flac,and had then straightened himself up again and now thenardier the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel
8304,83-9960-0032.flac,are to jeweller's work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry there are benvenuto cellinis in the galleys
8305,83-9960-0042.flac,the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow the prisoner resumed do what you please with me he was disarmed
8306,83-9960-0037.flac,they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou it is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand
8307,83-9960-0031.flac,when the police made their descent on it this sou piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape
8308,83-9960-0025.flac,for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage reverie
8309,83-9960-0056.flac,with written names thrown into a hat would you like my hat cried a voice on the threshold
8310,83-9960-0030.flac,stared at him in stupefaction as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the red hot chisel which emitted a threatening glow
8311,83-9960-0018.flac,false address the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again she resumed nobody there
8312,83-9960-0043.flac,seize him said thenardier two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked man with a ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him
8313,83-9960-0039.flac,that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to say he stripped up his left sleeve and added see here
8314,83-9960-0050.flac,softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round it and tossed the hole through the crevice into the middle of the den it was high time thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples
8315,83-9960-0041.flac,the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself
8316,83-9960-0023.flac,and after all that racing and feed to the coachman and all i spoke to both the porter and the portress a fine stout woman and they know nothing about him marius breathed freely once more
8317,83-9960-0022.flac,it's nothing but a big carriage gate
8318,83-9960-0036.flac,he possesses liberty it was a large sou of this sort
8319,83-9960-0038.flac,as he had not been able to bent down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise be easy
8320,83-9960-0040.flac,at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle
8321,83-9960-0019.flac,she paused choking then went on
8322,83-9960-0054.flac,replied thenardier since ponine has thrown the stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on that side the mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key on the floor
8323,83-9960-0052.flac,thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle it's in eponene's handwriting the devil he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near
8324,83-9960-0017.flac,he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously
8325,83-9960-0035.flac,in this box he hides a watch spring and this watch spring properly handled cuts good sized chains and bars of iron the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou not at all
8326,83-9960-0016.flac,in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again the prisoner made a movement in his bonds here's the bourgeoise said thenardier
8327,83-9960-0055.flac,thenardier exclaimed are you mad are you crazy what a pack of boobies you want to waste time do you draw lots do you by a wet finger by a short straw
8328,83-9960-0048.flac,marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair all at once a shudder ran through him at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon
8329,83-9960-0020.flac,you are too good you see if it had been me i'd have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with and if he had acted ugly i'd have boiled him alive he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is
8330,83-9960-0045.flac,there is only one thing left to do cut his throat that's it it was the husband and wife taking counsel together thenardier walked slowly towards the table
8331,83-9960-0051.flac,she handed it to her husband where did this come from demanded thenardier pardy ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from through the window of course
8332,83-9960-0033.flac,the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common wooden handled knife to saw a sou into two thin plates
8333,83-9960-0046.flac,opened the drawer and took out the knife marius fretted with the handle of his pistol unprecedented perplexity for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience
8334,83-9960-0015.flac,marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart breaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none
8335,83-9960-0047.flac,the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony up to that moment
8336,83-9960-0028.flac,the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier
8337,83-9960-0049.flac,this was the expedient of which he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him of sparing the assassin and saving the victim he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper
8338,83-9960-0021.flac,and where he keeps his shiners that's the way i should have managed matters people are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women
8339,83-9960-0053.flac,asked the thenardier woman we haven't the time through what
8340,83-9960-0027.flac,what did you expect to gain by that to gain time cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut
8341,83-9960-0034.flac,to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is a box
8342,83-9960-0006.flac,they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses your young lady will be taken to it she will alight from the fiacra
8343,83-9960-0002.flac,almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature
8344,83-9960-0001.flac,this was what marius perceived most clearly of all a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene there he stood
8345,83-9960-0007.flac,my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come back here to tell us it's done as for the young lady no harm will be done to her
8346,83-9960-0003.flac,and then i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her nothing shall stop me nearly half an hour passed in this manner thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections
8347,83-9960-0005.flac,think that the lark really is your daughter
8348,83-9960-0009.flac,the prisoner uttered not a syllable after a pause thenardier continued it's very simple as you see there'll be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done
8349,83-9960-0000.flac,the enigma was more impenetrable than ever who was this little one whom thenardier had called the lark was she his ursule the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the lark
8350,83-9960-0014.flac,it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment
8351,83-9960-0011.flac,as soon as my wife returns and says to me the lark is on the way we will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home you see that our intentions are not evil
8352,83-9960-0010.flac,i'm telling you how things stand i warn you so that you may be prepared he paused the prisoner did not break the silence and thenardier resumed
8353,83-9960-0008.flac,and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark that's all
8354,83-9960-0012.flac,what that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back one of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness whither and what if it were she it was clear that it was she
8355,83-9960-0013.flac,what was he to do discharge the pistol place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice but the horrible man with a meat axe would none the less be out of reach with the young girl
8356,83-9960-0004.flac,the prisoner did not stir still marius fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner all at once thenardier addressed the prisoner
8357,83-3054-0008.flac,and many of them being separated by the violence of the shock they fell upon a crab tree which was growing below them they have like the farena of plants united and produced a fish resembling both
8358,83-3054-0009.flac,i endeavored to bring one with me but it was too cumbersome and my salt water pegasus seemed much displeased at every attempt to stop his career whilst i continued upon his back
8359,83-3054-0012.flac,not only able but really wished to devour us now as my rosinante was blind i had these hungry gentlemen's attempts to guard against in addition to my other difficulties
8360,83-3054-0014.flac,when i came close i perceived her hand move i took it into mine and brought her on shore as a corpse an apothecary who had just been instructed by doctor hawes
8361,83-3054-0006.flac,the periwinkle is a kind of shrub it grows at the foot of the oyster tree and twines round it as the ivy does the oak
8362,83-3054-0017.flac,and let her make the impression of her fingers upon the waves rather than his face he was not much out in his ideas of the consequence for meeting no opposition she went directly overboard
8363,83-3054-0004.flac,are said to be upwards of one hundred fathoms below the surface of the sea on the sides of which there was a great variety of tall noble trees loaded with marine fruit such as lobsters crabs oysters scollops
8364,83-3054-0002.flac,i will now faithfully give you in his own words as i heard him relate them to his friends several times on my arrival says my father at halvetslus i was observed to breathe with some difficulty
8365,83-3054-0005.flac,fruit shook off the branches of the tree it grows upon by the motion of the water as those in our gardens are by that of the wind the lobster trees appeared the richest but the crab and oysters were the tallest
8366,83-3054-0001.flac,i omitted several very material parts in my father's journey across the english channel to holland which that they may not be totally lost
8367,83-3054-0019.flac,he found this gentle creature waiting his arrival and learned the means by which she came into the world again
8368,83-3054-0013.flac,as we drew near the dutch shore and the body of water over our heads did not exceed twenty fathoms i thought i saw a human figure in a female dress then lying on the sand before me with some signs of life
8369,83-3054-0016.flac,followed him in an open boat as soon as she had got on the quarter deck she flew at her husband and attempted to strike him with such impetuosity that he thought it most prudent to slip on one side
8370,83-3054-0011.flac,therefore i had no inclination to prolong the time add to this my situation was in other respects very unpleasant i met many large fish who were if i could judge by their open mouths
8371,83-3054-0007.flac,as she sank she fell upon her side and forced a very large lobster tree out of its place it was in the spring when the lobsters were very young
8372,83-3054-0000.flac,a woman's life saved the cause of her falling into the sea
8373,83-3054-0003.flac,carrying their heads at the extremity of their tails i crossed continued he one prodigious range of rocks equal in height to the alps the tops or highest parts of these marine mountains
8374,83-3054-0010.flac,besides i was then though galloping over a mountain of rocks that lay about midway the passage at least five hundred fathom below the surface of the sea and began to find the want of air inconvenient
8375,83-3054-0018.flac,and it was my unfortunate lot to lay the foundation for bringing this happy pair together again i can easily conceive what execrations the husband loaded me with when on his return
8376,83-3054-0015.flac,of london treated her properly and she recovered she was the rib of a man who commanded a vessel belonging to halvetsless he was just going out of port on a voyage when she hearing he had got a mistress with him
8377,83-11691-0012.flac,well think of that udo showed what he thought of it by waving it peevishly this is not a time for tact he said tell me what i look like coronel considered for a moment
8378,83-11691-0003.flac,coronel came back from his stroll in the same casual way in which he had started
8379,83-11691-0028.flac,really i don't know perhaps because i'm too unimportant yes that must be it he began to feel a little brighter obviously that's it he caressed a whisker with one of his paws
8380,83-11691-0008.flac,i think i'm coming out wondering what it all meant coronel waited in silence yes i am coming out coronel said the voice but you mustn't be surprised if i don't look very well
8381,83-11691-0036.flac,this he rejected at once when you have the head of a rabbit the tail of a lion and the middle of a woolly lamb the need for action of some kind is imperative
8382,83-11691-0040.flac,already then he had suffered in her service so at least he would say and so possibly it might be coronel had thought him funny but women had not much sense of humor as a rule
8383,83-11691-0027.flac,and make her tell me what she knows she knows something i'm certain then we shall see better what to do udo mused for a space why didn't they turn you into anything he asked
8384,83-11691-0015.flac,i was afraid so he said that's the cruel part about it had i been a lion there would have been a certain pathetic splendor about my position isolated cut off suffering in regal silence
8385,83-11691-0014.flac,said udo nervously then frankly your royal highness looks funny very funny said udo wistfully very funny said coronel his highness sighed
8386,83-11691-0020.flac,rabbit he sobbed so undignified
8387,83-11691-0039.flac,why not the princess hyacinth had called for him what devotion it showed if he came to her even now in his present state of bad health she was in trouble
8388,83-11691-0032.flac,coronel got on his horse and rode away as soon as he was out of earshot he began to laugh spasm after spasm shook him no sooner had he composed himself to gravity
8389,83-11691-0034.flac,however we'll soon get him all right that evening he reached the place where the cottage had stood but it was gone next morning he rode back to the wood udo was gone too
8390,83-11691-0030.flac,he murmured to himself obviously
8391,83-11691-0043.flac,untamable in the man they love well there it was it was not as if he had coronel with him coronel and he in his present health could never have gone into euralia together
8392,83-11691-0026.flac,it was likely that she alone could turn him back again and that in that case he had better only threaten her i want somebody killed said udo rather naturally suppose said coronel
8393,83-11691-0023.flac,i was very polite to her don't you remember my saying to you be polite to her because she's probably a fairy
8394,83-11691-0000.flac,this is a painful chapter for me to write mercifully it is to be a short one later on i shall become used to the situation inclined even to dwell upon its humorous side
8395,83-11691-0001.flac,but for the moment i cannot see beyond the sadness of it that to a prince of the royal house of araby
8396,83-11691-0007.flac,coronel stopped your royal highness's commands he began rather coldly there was an ominous sniffing from the bushes coronel said an unhappy voice at last
8397,83-11691-0041.flac,she would find him strokable and the lion in him
8398,83-11691-0044.flac,the contrast was too striking but he alone hyacinth's only help surely she would appreciate his magnanimity also as he had told himself a moment ago
8399,83-11691-0006.flac,he said isn't it time we were starting we aren't starting said the voice what's the matter what are you hiding in the bushes for whatever's the matter udo
8400,83-11691-0025.flac,was that coronel should go back that afternoon and kill the old woman coronel pointed out that as she had turned prince udo into into a a quite so said udo
8401,83-11691-0010.flac,it is difficult to say what he was save that there was an impression of magnificence about his person such magnificence anyhow as is given by an astracan trimmed fur coat
8402,83-11691-0033.flac,then a remembrance of udo's appearance started him off again i couldn't have stayed with him a moment longer he thought i should have burst
8403,83-11691-0004.flac,he was not thinking of udo he was wondering if princess hyacinth had an attendant of surpassing beauty or a dragon of surpassing malevolence if in fact
8404,83-11691-0038.flac,so popular to araby where he rode daily among his father's subjects that they might have the pleasure of cheering him how awkward for everybody on to euralia then
8405,83-11691-0011.flac,coronel decided that it was an occasion for tact ah here you are he said cheerfully shall we get along don't be a fool coronel said udo almost crying
8406,83-11691-0042.flac,she would find that inspiring
8407,83-11691-0019.flac,striking i haven't seen it you see to one who didn't know your royal highness
8408,83-11691-0009.flac,i' i'm corodel here i am said udo pathetically
8409,83-11691-0021.flac,he added bitterly how did it happen i don't know coronel i just went to sleep
8410,83-11691-0024.flac,so they held a council of war prince udo put forward two suggestions the first was that coronel should go back on the morrow and kill the old woman the second
8411,83-11691-0037.flac,he might go back to araby
8412,83-11691-0013.flac,really frankly he asked
8413,83-11691-0031.flac,good bye your royal highness
8414,83-11691-0045.flac,but no doubt he would think of some tremendously cunning device later on to euralia then with all despatch he trotted off
8415,83-11691-0002.flac,roger scurvy legs frankly breaks down over it that abominable woman he says meaning of course belvane and he has hysterics for more than a page let us describe it calmly
8416,83-11691-0018.flac,and where one does not laugh one may come to love
8417,83-11691-0022.flac,he sat up suddenly and stared at coronel it was that old woman did it you mark my words coronel she did it why should she
8418,83-11691-0005.flac,there were any adventures in euralia for a humble fellow like himself coronel said a small voice behind him he turned round indifferently
8419,83-11691-0016.flac,he waved an explanatory paw even in the most hideous of beasts there might be a dignity he meditated for a moment have you ever seen a yak coronel he asked never
8420,83-11691-0029.flac,they were afraid of me he began to look so much happier that coronel thought it was a favorable moment in which to withdraw shall i go now your royal highness
8421,83-11691-0035.flac,he returned to the palace and began to think it out left to himself udo very soon made up his mind there were three courses open to him he might stay where he was till he was restored to health
8422,83-11691-0017.flac,i saw one once in barodia it is not a beautiful animal coronel but as a yak i should not have been entirely unlovable one does not laugh at a yak coronel
8423,2159-179157-0031.flac,their impersonizations are ridiculous in the extreme one man i remember believed himself to be controlled by the spirit of charles sumner being uneducated he used the most wretched english
8424,2159-179157-0014.flac,i felt in a vague way that there were beings all about me but could not hear their voices i felt as though every muscle in my body was fixed and rigid
8425,2159-179157-0018.flac,all of which were presumably due to opium the causes which doctor cocke thinks produced the hypnotic condition in his case namely belief desire to be hypnotized and strained attention united with a vivid imagination
8426,2159-179157-0010.flac,however honest he might be at the start soon began to deceive himself as well as others until he lost his power entirely to distinguish between fact and imagination before discussing the matter further
8427,2159-179157-0017.flac,his descriptions of dreams bear a wonderful likeness to de quincey's dreams such as those described in the english mail coach de profondus and the confessions of an english opium eater
8428,2159-179157-0011.flac,let us quote doctor cocke's experiment in hypnotizing himself it will be remembered that a professional hypnotizer or magnetizer had hypnotized him by telling him to fix his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand
8429,2159-179157-0001.flac,that they have any peculiar power in themselves which they exert over their fellows one of these professionals gives an account in his book of what he calls the wonderful locke method he says that
8430,2159-179157-0024.flac,and possibly these two things will turn out to be much the same in fact on no other ground can we explain the so called children's crusade in which over thirty thousand children from germany from all classes of the community
8431,2159-179157-0016.flac,secondly i wished to be hypnotized these together with a vivid imagination and strained attention brought on the states which occurred
8432,2159-179157-0021.flac,by prolonging the operation the whole community becomes more or less hypnotized in all such cases however unusual excitement is commonly followed by unusual lethargy
8433,2159-179157-0007.flac,and how it extends to the professional subjects as well as to the professional operators till those subjects even impose upon scientific men who ought to be proof against such deception
8434,2159-179157-0013.flac,the roar became deafening it crackled like a mighty fire i was fearfully conscious of myself having read vivid accounts of dreams visions et cetera it occurred to me that i would experience them
8435,2159-179157-0029.flac,is that of the mystic swedenborg who saw such strange things in his visions and at last came to believe in them as real the same explanation may be given of the manifestations of oriental prophets
8436,2159-179157-0030.flac,for in the orient hypnotism is much easier and more systematically developed than with us of the west the performances of the dervishes and also of the fakers who wound themselves and perform many wonderful feats
8437,2159-179157-0008.flac,moreover the possibility of self hypnotization carefully concealed and called by another name opens another great field of humbug and charlatanism of which the advertising columns of the newspapers are constantly filled
8438,2159-179157-0020.flac,for instance the effects of an exciting religious revival are very like those produced by mesmers operations in paris the subjects become hysterical and are ready to believe anything or do anything
8439,2159-179157-0026.flac,gazing steadily at a bed of bright coals or a stream of running water will invariably throw a sensitive subject into a hypnotic sleep that will last sometimes for several hours doctor cocke says
8440,2159-179157-0028.flac,with its lofty dome or the faces of imaginary beings beautiful or demoniacal according to the will and temper of the subject perhaps the most wonderful example of self hypnotism which we have in history
8441,2159-179157-0006.flac,probably no scientific phenomenon was ever so grossly prostituted to base ends as that of hypnotism later we shall see some of the outrageous forms this charlatanism assumes
8442,2159-179157-0009.flac,namely that of the clairvoyant and medium we may conceive how such a profession might become perfectly legitimate and highly useful but at present it seems as if any person who went into it
8443,2159-179157-0023.flac,are no doubt the effect of hypnotization by the priests some of the strange movements of whole communities during the crusades are to be explained either on the theory of hypnotization or of contagion
8444,2159-179157-0032.flac,and his language was utterly devoid of sense while on the other hand a very intelligent lady who believed herself to be controlled by the spirit of charlotte cushman personated the part very well doctor cooke says of himself
8445,2159-179157-0015.flac,the roar in my ears grew louder still and i heard above the roar reports which sounded like artillery and musketry then above the den of the noise a musical chord i seemed to be absorbed in this chord i knew nothing else
8446,2159-179157-0027.flac,that he has experimented in this direction with patiencs of his says he they have the ability to resist the state or to bring it at will many of them describe beautiful scenes from nature or some mighty cathedral
8447,2159-179157-0025.flac,tried to cross the alps in winter and in their struggles were all lost or sold into slavery without even reaching the holy land again hypnotism is accountable for many of the poets dreams
8448,2159-179157-0033.flac,i can hypnotize myself to such an extent that i will become wholly unconscious of events taking place around me and a long interval of time say from one half to two hours will be a complete blank
8449,2159-179157-0019.flac,are causes which are often found in conjunction and produce effects which we may reasonably explain on the theory of self hypnotization
8450,2159-179157-0002.flac,though he is locked up in a separate room he can make the psychic power work through the walls all that he does is to put his subjects in the way of hypnotizing themselves
8451,2159-179157-0003.flac,he shows his inconsistency when he states that under certain circumstances the hypnotizer is in danger of becoming hypnotized himself in this he makes no claim that the subject is using any psychic power
8452,2159-179157-0022.flac,in fact it is a sort of intoxication the same phenomena are probably accountable for many of the strange records of history the wonderful cures at lurds of which we have read in zola's novel of that name
8453,2159-179157-0012.flac,i was intensely cold my heart seemed to stand still i had ringing in my ears my hair seemed to rise upon my scalp i persisted in the effort and the previously mentioned noise in my ears grew louder and louder
8454,2159-179157-0004.flac,but of course if the hypnotizer looks steadily into the eyes of his subject and the subject looks into his eyes the steady gaze on a bright object will produce hypnotism in one quite as readily as in the other
8455,2159-179157-0005.flac,hypnotism is an established pscientific fact but the claim that the hypnotizer has any mysterious psychic power is the invariable mark of the charlatan
8456,2159-179157-0000.flac,and it is true that a person can deliberately hypnotize himself when he wishes to till he has become accustomed to it and is expert in it so to speak it does away at a stroke with the claims of all professional hypnotists and magnetic healers
8457,2159-179154-0035.flac,he looked for a moment and then dashed down the platform into the audience and seizing the man's head vigorously rubbed it as this did not extinguish the flames he took off his coat and put the fire out in doing this he set his coat on fire
8458,2159-179154-0017.flac,in the meantime the act had caused great laughter among the rest of the class one young fellow in particular laughed so uproariously that tears coursed down his cheeks and he took out his handkerchief to wipe his eyes
8459,2159-179154-0013.flac,they immediately began and twirled them faster and faster in spite of their efforts to stop one of the subjects said he thought of nothing but the strange action of his hands and sometimes it puzzled him to know why they whirled
8460,2159-179154-0014.flac,at this point doctor flint's daughter took charge of the class she pointed her finger at one of them and the subject began to look steadily before him at which the rest of the class were highly amused
8461,2159-179154-0006.flac,at each individual awoke him one of the subjects when questioned afterward as to what sensation he experienced at the snapping of the fingers replied that it seemed to him as if something inside of his head responded
8462,2159-179154-0024.flac,at the same time into the audience the one who was impersonating a newsboy went about crying his edition in a loud voice while the hunter crawled along stealthily and carefully
8463,2159-179154-0029.flac,she touched each one of the class in succession and every one manifested the utmost pain and fear one subject sat down on the floor and cried in dire distress
8464,2159-179154-0034.flac,all the world loves a lover as the saying is and all the world loves to laugh at him one of the subjects was told that the head of a man in the audience was on fire
8465,2159-179154-0001.flac,the following is a description of a public performance given by doctor herbert l flint a very successful public operator it is in the language of an eye witness a new york lawyer
8466,2159-179154-0039.flac,he pointed to a suppositious canvas picture he chaffed the boys he flattered the vanity of the young fellows with their girls telling them that they could not afford for the small sum of ten cents to miss this great show
8467,2159-179154-0002.flac,in response to a call for volunteers twenty young and middle aged men came upon the stage they evidently belonged to the great middle class the entertainment commenced by doctor flint passing around the group
8468,2159-179154-0022.flac,he was informed that he could tell who the father was by the similarity and the colour of the eyes these suggestions were made in a loud tone miss flint being no nearer one subject than another
8469,2159-179154-0011.flac,he was then away from any one who could influence him he replied that the very idea was repugnant however he was induced to take a cigarette in his mouth but it made him ill and he flung it away with every expression of disgust
8470,2159-179154-0032.flac,the manner in which little by little he ventured upon a familiar footing was exceedingly funny but when in a moment of confident response to his wooing he clasped her round the waist and imprinted a chaste kiss upon the brushy part of the broom
8471,2159-179154-0030.flac,had the suggestion been continued it would undoubtedly have raised a blister one of the amusing experiments tried at a later time was that of a tall young man diffident pale and modest being given a broom carefully wrapped in a sheet
8472,2159-179154-0023.flac,the bare suggestion was given as now think that you are a newsboy and are selling papers or now think that you are hunting and are going into the woods to shoot birds so the party was started
8473,2159-179154-0016.flac,then he stopped miss flint led him to the front of the stage and left him standing in profound slumber he stood there stooping eyes set and vacant fast asleep
8474,2159-179154-0038.flac,that for the small sum of ten cents they could see more wonders than ever before had been crowded under one canvas tent he harangued the crowd as they surged about the tent door
8475,2159-179154-0019.flac,but the moment the gesture was made his countenance fell his mirth stopped while that of his companions redoubled and the change was so obvious that the audience shared in the laughter but the subject neither saw nor heard
8476,2159-179154-0007.flac,and with this sensation he regained self consciousness this is to be doubted as a rule subjects in this stage of hypnotism do not feel any sensation that they can remember
8477,2159-179154-0020.flac,his eyes assumed the same expression that had been noticed in his companions he too arose in the same attitude as if his head were pulling the body along and following the finger in the same way as his predecessor
8478,2159-179154-0008.flac,that you can't pull them apart they are fast you cannot pull them apart try you can't the whole class made frantic efforts to unclasp their hands but were unable to do so the doctor's explanation of this is
8479,2159-179154-0021.flac,another was given a broomstick and told to hunt game in the woods before him another was given a large rag doll and told that it was an infant and that he must look among the audience and discover the father
8480,2159-179154-0009.flac,that what they were really doing was to force their hands closer together thus obeying the counter suggestion that they thought they were trying to unclasp their hands was evident from their endeavours
8481,2159-179154-0000.flac,courting a broomstick the side show let us now describe some of the manifestations of hypnotism to see just how it operates and how it exhibits itself
8482,2159-179154-0010.flac,one young fellow aged about eighteen said that he was addicted to the cigarette habit the suggestion was made to him that he would not be able to smoke a cigarette for twenty four hours after the entertainment he was asked to smoke as was his usual habit
8483,2159-179154-0033.flac,disguised by the sheet the house resounded with roars of laughter the subject however was deaf to all of the noise he was absorbed in his courtship and he continued to hug the broom and exhibit in his features
8484,2159-179154-0025.flac,the newsboy even adopted the well worn device of asking those whom he solicited to buy to help him get rid of his stock one man offered him a cent when the price was two cents the newsboy chaffed the would be purchaser
8485,2159-179154-0031.flac,and told that it was his sweetheart he accepted the situation and sat down by the broom he was a little sheepish at first but eventually he grew bolder and smiled upon her such a smile as malvolio casts upon olivia
8486,2159-179154-0003.flac,who were seated on the stage in a semicircle facing the audience and stroking each one's head and forehead repeating the phrases close your eyes think of nothing but sleep you are very tired you are drowsy
8487,2159-179154-0005.flac,while a few were wide awake and smiling at the rest these latter were dismissed as unlikely subjects when the stage had been cleared of all those who were not responsive the doctor passed around and snapping his finger
8488,2159-179154-0026.flac,and taking him into the centre of the stage showed him a small riding whip he looked at it indifferently enough he was told it was a hot bar of iron but he shook his head still incredulous
8489,2159-179154-0036.flac,then he calmly resumed his garment and walked back to the stage the side show closed the evening's entertainment a young man was told to think of himself as managing a side show at a circus
8490,2159-179154-0027.flac,the suggestion was repeated and as the glazed look came into his eyes the incredulous look died out every member of the class was following the suggestion made to the subject in hand all of them had the same expression in their eyes the doctor said
8491,2159-179154-0012.flac,this is an instance of what is called post hypnotic suggestion doctor cocke tells of suggesting to a drinker whom he was trying to cure of the habit that for the next three days anything he took would make him vomit
8492,2159-179154-0015.flac,presently the subject's head leaned forward the pupils of his eyes dilated and assumed a peculiar glassy stare he arose with a steady gliding gait
8493,2159-179154-0018.flac,just as he was returning it to his pocket the lady suddenly pointed a finger at him
8494,2159-179154-0028.flac,that his daughter was hypnotizing the whole class through this one individual as she spoke she lightly touched the subject with the end of the whip the moment the subject felt the whip he jumped and shrieked as if it really were a hot iron
8495,2159-179154-0004.flac,you feel very sleepy as he did this several of the volunteers closed their eyes at once and one fell asleep immediately one or two remained awake
8496,2159-179154-0037.flac,when his mind had absorbed this idea he was ordered to open his exhibition he at once mounted a table and in the voice of the traditional side shaw fectir began to dilate upon the fat woman and the snakes
8497,2159-179156-0018.flac,he believed they were in a condition of self induced hypnotism in which their subjective faculties were so exalted as to supersede their objective perceptions music was no longer to them a succession of pleasing sounds
8498,2159-179156-0034.flac,and call the letters as i directed stimulation was in this case impossible as i made him read fifteen or twenty pages he calling the letters as suggested each time they occurred the extraordinary heightening
8499,2159-179156-0000.flac,how the subject feels under hypnotization doctor cooper's experience effect of music doctor alfred martieu's experiments
8500,2159-179156-0007.flac,he then made passes over my head down over my hands and body but did not touch me he then said to me you cannot open your eyes the motor apparatus of my lids would not seemingly respond to my will
8501,2159-179156-0012.flac,but i was painfully conscious of the two contradictory elements within me i knew that my body existed but could not prove it to myself i knew that the statements made by the operator were in a measure untrue
8502,2159-179156-0021.flac,was played from the piano score the pulse of the subject became more rapid and at first of higher tension increasing from a normal rate of sixty beats a minute to one hundred twenty then
8503,2159-179156-0032.flac,it became slow and irregular and very small the respiration decreased almost to gasping the face grew pale and a cold perspiration broke out readers who are especially interested in this subject
8504,2159-179156-0006.flac,the operator said you are going to sleep you are getting sleepy you cannot open your eyes i was conscious that my heart was beating rapidly and i felt a sensation of terror
8505,2159-179156-0009.flac,the feeling of not wishing to open my eyes was not based upon any desire to please the operator i had no personal interest in him in any way but be it understood i firmly believed in his power to control me
8506,2159-179156-0023.flac,the state of mind brought up before him in the most realistic and vivid manner possible the picture of the ride of tam o'shanter which he had seen years before the picture
8507,2159-179156-0026.flac,this subject did not pass into such a deep state of hypnotism but the result was practically the same the pulse rate rose from seventy to one hundred twenty the sensation remembered was that of riding furiously through the air
8508,2159-179156-0010.flac,then he stroked the arm and said it was growing numb he said you have no feeling in it have you doctor cocke goes on i said no and i knew that i said no
8509,2159-179156-0019.flac,but the embodiment of a drama in which they became so wrapped up that they forgot all about the mechanical and external features of the music and lived completely in a fairy world of dream
8510,2159-179156-0025.flac,and yet playing the part of spectator as is often the case in dreams doctor warthin tried the same experiment again this time on a young man who was not so emotional and was hypnotized with much more difficulty
8511,2159-179156-0031.flac,appears to summon sigmund to valhalla
8512,2159-179156-0011.flac,the operator went on pricking the arm with a pin and though doctor cocke felt the pain he said he did not feel it and at the same time the sensation of terror increased i was not conscious of my body at all he says further on
8513,2159-179156-0001.flac,the sensations produced during a state of hypnosis are very interesting as may be supposed they differ greatly in different persons
8514,2159-179156-0033.flac,will find descriptions of many other interesting experiments in the same article doctor cocke describes a peculiar trick he played upon the sight of a subject says he i once hypnotized a man
8515,2159-179156-0003.flac,he was at that time a firm believer in the theory of personal magnetism a delusion from which he afterward escaped on the occasion which he describes the operator commanded him to close his eyes
8516,2159-179156-0008.flac,yet i was conscious that while one part of my mind wanted to open my eyes another part did not want to so i was in a paradoxical state i believed that i could open my eyes and yet could not
8517,2159-179156-0017.flac,in which he describes the effects of music upon hypnotic subjects while in vienna he took occasion to observe closely the enthusiastic musical devotees as they sat in the audience at the performance of one of wagner's operas
8518,2159-179156-0028.flac,to him it always expressed the pictured wild ride of the daughters of wotan the subject taking part in the ride it was noticeable in each case that the same music played to them in the waking state produced no special impression
8519,2159-179156-0002.flac,one of the most interesting accounts ever given is that of doctor james r cock a hypnotist himself who submitted to being operated upon by a professional magnetizer
8520,2159-179156-0016.flac,we shall consider in another chapter in this connection we find great interest in an article in the medical news july twenty eighth eighteen ninety four
8521,2159-179156-0024.flac,soon became real to him and he found himself taking part in a wild chase not as witch devil or tam even but in some way his consciousness was spread through every part of the scene being of it
8522,2159-179156-0015.flac,by fixing his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand this time he experienced a still greater degree of terror and incidentally learned that he could hypnotize himself the matter of self hypnotism
8523,2159-179156-0029.flac,at first it seemed to produce the opposite effect for the pulse was lowered later it rose to a rate double the normal and the tension was diminished the impression described by the subject afterward
8524,2159-179156-0014.flac,it seemed to me that the hypnotist commanded me to awake as soon as i dropped my arm and yet ten minutes of unconsciousness had passed on a subsequent occasion doctor cocke who was blind was put into a deep hypnotic sleep
8525,2159-179156-0035.flac,and clair voyance if the powers of the mind are so enormously increased all that is required of a very sensitive and easily hypnotized person is to hypnotize him or herself when he will be able to read thoughts
8526,2159-179156-0004.flac,but he did open them at once again he told him to close the eyes and at the same time he gently stroked his head and face and eyelids with his hand doctor cocke fancied he felt a tingling sensation in his forehead and eyes
8527,2159-179156-0030.flac,and the subject seemed to contemplate a landscape of lofty grandeur a different sort of music was played
8528,2159-179156-0027.flac,the experiment was repeated on other subjects in all cases with the same result
8529,2159-179156-0005.flac,which he supposed came from the hand of the operator afterward he came to believe that this sensation was purely imaginary on his part then he says a sensation akin to fear came over me
8530,2159-179156-0020.flac,this observation suggested to him an interesting series of experiments his first subject was easily hypnotized and of an emotional nature wagner's
8531,2159-179156-0022.flac,as the music progressed the tension diminished the respiration increased from eighteen to thirty per minute great excitement in the subject was evident his whole body was thrown into motion his legs were drawn up his arms tossed into the air
8532,2159-179156-0013.flac,i obeyed them voluntarily and involuntarily this is the last remembrance that i have of that hypnotic experience after this however the operator caused the doctor to do a number of things which he learned of from his friends after the performance was over
8533,5867-48852-0022.flac,only she poor young lady she'll be better now mister john a deal better
8534,5867-48852-0045.flac,but not the less should he have it of right seeing that he desired it but yet missus dale did not dare to get up and leave the room lily had asked her not to do so and at the present period of their lives all lily's requests were sacred
8535,5867-48852-0039.flac,i don't know anybody i should so much like for a brother i'm very glad that you like him very glad i hope you'll be friends always there was some little tenderness in this as john acknowledged to himself i'm sure we shall if he likes it that is if i ever happened to see him
8536,5867-48852-0065.flac,i could not have that one thing and i was nearer to my heart's longings than you have ever been i cannot have that one thing but i know that there are other things and i will not allow myself to be broken hearted
8537,5867-48852-0017.flac,here he encountered hopkins
8538,5867-48852-0040.flac,i'll do anything for him i can if he ever comes up to london wouldn't it be a good thing missus dale if he settled himself in london no john it would be a very bad thing why should he wish to rob me of my daughter missus dale was speaking of her eldest daughter
8539,5867-48852-0106.flac,and had already seen his handiwork has she offended you john she said
8540,5867-48852-0038.flac,of course nothing is settled it was such fun said lily james who took at any rate a year or two to make his proposal wanted to be married the next day afterwards no lily not quite that well mamma it was very nearly that
8541,5867-48852-0098.flac,as it was he did not think it possible that he should return to his place in the earl's house how could he pretend to maintain his ordinary demeanour under the eyes of those two old men it would be better for him to get home to his mother
8542,5867-48852-0047.flac,to say that you think we shall not go it was only last night that you suggested it the truth is john that hopkins came in and discoursed with the most wonderful eloquence nobody dared to oppose hopkins he made us almost cry he was so pathetic
8543,5867-48852-0110.flac,if you can be constant in your love you may win her yet remember how young she is and how young you both are come again in two years time and then when you have won her you shall tell me that i have been a good old woman to you both
8544,5867-48852-0101.flac,it was not only of his late disappointment that he was thinking but of his whole past life he was conscious of his hobbldy hoyhood
8545,5867-48852-0062.flac,always know to that how can it be otherwise you would not have me marry you while i love another but he is gone he has taken another wife i cannot change myself because he is changed
8546,5867-48852-0051.flac,and had asked all the dales there and had offered himself up as a sacrifice at the cruel shrine of a serious dinner party to say nothing of that easier and lighter sacrifice which he had made in a pecuniary point of view in order that this thing might be done
8547,5867-48852-0049.flac,john however remembered well at this moment all that the gardener had said to him did she know of that encounter between him and crosbie and if she did know of it in what light did she regard it
8548,5867-48852-0021.flac,he never looked at one as though one were a christian did he mister john
8549,5867-48852-0111.flac,i shall never win her lady julia as he spoke these last words the tears were running down his cheeks
8550,5867-48852-0073.flac,she spoke in a low voice slowly almost with difficulty but still the words came very clearly with a clear distinct voice which caused them to be remembered with accuracy
8551,5867-48852-0013.flac,he had told her that he hated crosbie calling him that man and assuring her that no earthly consideration should induce him to go into that man's house then he had walked away moodily wishing him all manner of evil
8552,5867-48852-0103.flac,if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating regardless whether he himself might be called upon to follow him was it not hard that for the two of them for lily and for him also
8553,5867-48852-0095.flac,and had so made a fool of himself that now all hope and happiness were over for him how could he escape at once out of the country back to london how could he get away without saying a word further to any one
8554,5867-48852-0080.flac,when we do meet let us be glad to see each other no other friend shall ever be dearer to me than you are you are so true and honest when you marry i will tell your wife what an infinite blessing god has given her
8555,5867-48852-0029.flac,i don't know perhaps it will be better that i should no mamma no what good can it do it can do no good i like him as well as i can like anyone i love him dearly but it can do no good let him come in here and be very kind to him
8556,5867-48852-0102.flac,of that backwardness on his part in assuming manhood which had rendered him incapable of making himself acceptable to lily before she had fallen into the clutches of crosbie
8557,5867-48852-0090.flac,he had failed and he acknowledged to himself with bitter reproaches that he had failed now and for ever he told himself that he had obtruded upon her in her sorrow with an unmannerly love
8558,5867-48852-0088.flac,and then pulled out his own watch as though to verify the one by the other he made unconsciously a struggle to drive away from his thoughts the facts of the late scene and for some five or ten minutes he succeeded
8559,5867-48852-0043.flac,and of this missus dale soon felt herself aware the thing had to be done and no little precautionary measure such as this of missus dale's enforced presence would prevent it of this missus dale was well aware
8560,5867-48852-0012.flac,and she had answered him by telling him that she loved mister crosbie better than all the world besides of course she had done so at that time but nevertheless her manner of telling him had seemed to him d to be cruel and he also had been cruel
8561,5867-48852-0053.flac,should he get up boldly and ask lily to put on her bonnet and come out into the garden as the thought struck him he rose and grasped at his hat i am going to walk back to guestwick said he it was very good of you to come so far to see us
8562,5867-48852-0052.flac,under such circumstances eames was too honest a man not to do it let the difficulties in his way be what they might he had sat there for an hour and missus dale still remained with her daughter
8563,5867-48852-0000.flac,bell had declared that her sister would be very happy to see john eames if he would go over to allington and he had replied that of course he would go there so much having been as it were settled
8564,5867-48852-0055.flac,have a glass of wine before you go oh dear no i think i'll go back through the squires fields and out on the road at the white gate the path is quite dry now i dare say it is said missus dale lily
8565,5867-48852-0081.flac,you shall never do that yes i will i understand what you mean but yet i will good bye missus dale he said good bye john
8566,5867-48852-0104.flac,there should be such punishment because of the insincerity of that man when he had thus stood upon the bridge for some quarter of an hour he took out his knife and with deep rough gashes in the wood cut out lily's name from the rail
8567,5867-48852-0112.flac,it was well for him that she had come upon him in his sorrow when he once knew that she had seen his tears
8568,5867-48852-0030.flac,and i shall be very glad to see him then missus dale went round to the other room and admitted her visitor through the window of the drawing room we are in terrible confusion john are we not and so you are really going to live in guestwick
8569,5867-48852-0001.flac,he was able to speak of his visit as a matter of course at the breakfast table on the morning after the earl's dinner party i must get you to come round with me dale and see what i am doing to the land the earl said
8570,5867-48852-0094.flac,was it not the case that he had so fondly expected success as to think only of his triumph in returning and not of his more probable disgrace he had allowed others to make a fool of him
8571,5867-48852-0034.flac,how do you do john how do you do lily we all know the way in which such meetings are commenced each long to be tender and affectionate to the other
8572,5867-48852-0066.flac,you are stronger than i am he said not stronger but more certain make yourself as sure as i am and you too will be strong is it not so mamma
8573,5867-48852-0087.flac,as he made his way through the tombstones he paused and read one as though it interested him
8574,5867-48852-0009.flac,i am not prepared to say but eames took his advice as being in itself good and resolved to act upon it not that any resolution will be of any use he said to himself as he walked along
8575,5867-48852-0035.flac,but neither knew how to throw any tenderness into this first greeting so you're staying at the manor house said lily yes i'm staying there your uncle and bell came yesterday afternoon have you heard about bell said missus dale
8576,5867-48852-0108.flac,will be a consolation when you are as old as i am it is something to have had a heart
8577,5867-48852-0083.flac,he looked longingly into her face as though he had thought it possible that she also might kiss him then he pressed her hand to his lips and without speaking any further farewell took up his hat and left the room poor fellow
8578,5867-48852-0024.flac,eames passed on over the little bridge which seemed to be in a state of fast decay unattended to by any friendly carpenter now that the days of its use were so nearly at an end and on into the garden lingering on the spot where he had last said farewell to lily
8579,5867-48852-0050.flac,he had sworn to himself that he would not leave the small house without asking lily to be his wife it seemed to him as though he would be guilty of falsehood toward the earl if he did so lord de guest had opened his house to him
8580,5867-48852-0037.flac,i don't know that i am fond of such secrets but as she said this she thought of crosbie's engagement which had been told to every one and of its consequences is it to be soon he asked well yes we think so
8581,5867-48852-0006.flac,resting when he might choose to rest and running when it might suit him to run and she is not like other girls he thought to himself she won't care for my boots being dirty so at last he elected to walk
8582,5867-48852-0018.flac,mister john may i make so bold and hopkins held out a very dirty hand which eames of course took unconscious of the cause of this new affection i'm just going to call at the small house and i thought i'd come this way
8583,5867-48852-0086.flac,he made his way out by the front door and through the churchyard and in this way on to the field through which he had asked lily to walk with him
8584,5867-48852-0084.flac,said missus dale they should not have let him come said lily but they don't understand
8585,5867-48852-0054.flac,i was always fond of walking he said
8586,5867-48852-0069.flac,but it will not be so forever lily for ever why should he not be mine as well as hers when that forever comes john if you understand what it is to love
8587,5867-48852-0068.flac,that i loved him better than all the world besides it is still the same i still love him better than all the world how then can i give you any hope
8588,5867-48852-0036.flac,oh yes mary told me i'm so glad of it i always liked doctor crofts very much i have not congratulated her because i didn't know whether it was a secret but crofts was there last night and if it is a secret he didn't seem to be very careful about keeping it
8589,5867-48852-0092.flac,he almost hated the earl for having brought him to this condition a conquering hero indeed how should he manage to sneak back among them all at the manor house crestfallen and abject in his misery
8590,5867-48852-0070.flac,you will say nothing more of it i have spoken to you more openly about this than i have ever done to anybody even to mamma because i have wished to make you understand my feelings
8591,5867-48852-0044.flac,and she felt moreover that john was entitled to an opportunity of pleading his own cause
8592,5867-48852-0046.flac,they continued for some time to talk of crofts and his marriage and when that subject was finished they discussed their own probable or as it seemed now improbable removal to guestwick it's going too far mamma said lily
8593,5867-48852-0016.flac,at any rate i have a right to tell her now when he reached allington he did not go in through the village and up to the front of the small house by the cross street but turned by the church gate and passed over the squire's terrace
8594,5867-48852-0067.flac,i wish it could be otherwise i wish it could be otherwise if you can give him any hope mamma tell me that i may come again in a year he pleaded i cannot tell you so you may not come again not in this way
8595,5867-48852-0072.flac,i am not blaming him remember these things are different with the man she had not dropped his hand and as she made her last speech was sitting in her old chair with her eyes fixed upon the ground
8596,5867-48852-0078.flac,but now the attempt had been made and words had been forced from lily's lips the speaking of which would never be forgotten by herself i knew that it would be so said john ah yes
8597,5867-48852-0089.flac,and laughed inwardly as he remembered the figure of raffordy bringing in the knight's shoes he had gone some half mile upon his way before he ventured to stand still and tell himself that he had failed in the great object of his life yes
8598,5867-48852-0056.flac,i wonder whether you would come as far as that with me as the request was made missus dale looked at her daughter almost beseechingly do pray do said he it is a beautiful day for walking
8599,5867-48852-0011.flac,he had last seen her on the lawn behind the small house just at that time when her passion for crosbie was at the strongest eames had gone thither impelled by a foolish desire to declare to her his hopeless love
8600,5867-48852-0033.flac,that will be very troublesome is lily with you missus dale yes she is in the parlor come and see her so he followed missus dale through the hall and found himself in the presence of his love
8601,5867-48852-0079.flac,you know it because your heart understands my heart and you will not be angry with me and say naughty cruel words as you did once before we will think of each other john and pray for each other and will always love one another
8602,5867-48852-0059.flac,oh yes and then i should have to go again with you but john really i don't wish to walk to day whereupon john eames again put down his hat lily said he and then he stopped missus dale walked away to the window
8603,5867-48852-0008.flac,there's nothing sets em against a man like being sheepish how the earl knew so much
8604,5867-48852-0105.flac,he had hardly finished and was still looking at the chips as they were being carried away by the stream when a gentle step came close up to him and turning round he saw that lady julia was on the bridge she was close to him
8605,5867-48852-0063.flac,if you are kind to me you will let that be enough but you are so unkind to me no no oh i would wish to be so kind to you john here take my hand it is the hand of a friend who loves you and will always love you
8606,5867-48852-0004.flac,but this he declined and taking himself away hid himself about the place for the next hour and a half during this time he considered much whether it would be better for him to ride or walk if she should give him any hope
8607,5867-48852-0091.flac,and rebuked himself as having been not only foolish but ungenerous his friend the earl had been wont in his waggish way to call him the conquering hero and had so talked him out of his common sense as to have made him almost think that he would be successful in his suit
8608,5867-48852-0058.flac,i think i am almost tired and i had rather not go out it would do you good said missus dale i don't want to be done good too mamma besides i should have to come back by myself i'll come back with you said johnny
8609,5867-48852-0096.flac,he crossed the road at the end of the squire's property where the parish of allington divides itself from that of abbot's guest in which the earl's house stands and made his way back along the copse which skirted the field in which they had encountered the bull
8610,5867-48852-0109.flac,and john i can understand her feeling now and indeed i thought all through that you were asking her too soon but the time may yet come when she will think better of your wishes no no never i begin to know her now
8611,5867-48852-0093.flac,everybody knew the errand on which he had gone and everybody must know of his failure how could he have been such a fool as to undertake such a task under the eyes of so many lookers on
8612,5867-48852-0082.flac,and i will love you now then she put up her lips and kissed his face and so will i love you said lily giving him her hand again
8613,5867-48852-0060.flac,lily i have come over here on purpose to speak to you indeed i have come down from london only that i might see you have you john yes i have you know well all that i have got to tell you
8614,5867-48852-0020.flac,always said it i hated him allays i did indeed mister john
8615,5867-48852-0085.flac,and they mean to be good natured and to give me another very shortly after that lily went away by herself and sat alone for hours and when she joined her mother again at tea time nothing further was said of john eames's visit
8616,5867-48852-0064.flac,dear john i will do anything everything for you but that there is only one thing said he still holding her by the hand but with his face turned from her nay do not say so
8617,5867-48852-0100.flac,there he stopped and stood awhile with his broad hands spread over the letters which he had cut in those early days so as to hide them from his sight what an ass i have been always and ever he said to himself
8618,5867-48852-0057.flac,the path proposed lay right across the field into which lily had taken crosbie when she made her offer to let him off from his engagement could it be possible that she should ever walk there again with another lover no john she said not to day
8619,5867-48852-0005.flac,he could ride back triumphant as a field marshal then the horse would be delightful to him but if she should give him no hope if it should be his destiny to be rejected utterly on that morning then the horse would be terribly in the way of his sorrow
8620,5867-48852-0076.flac,or had attempted to make so clear an exposition of her own feelings i should be disgraced in my own eyes if i admitted the love of another man they were terrible words but very easy to be understood
8621,5867-48852-0015.flac,he had been ignominiously thrashed but what good would all this be if his image were still dear to lily's heart i told her that i loved her then he said to himself though i had no right to do so
8622,5867-48852-0028.flac,in this frame of mind he slowly made his way up across the lawn my dear there is john eames said missus dale who had first seen him from the parlour window don't go mamma
8623,5867-48852-0003.flac,or else as was more possible bell avoided the meeting no opportunity for such an interview offered itself though he hung about the drawing room all the morning you had better wait for luncheon now lady julia said to him about twelve
8624,5867-48852-0032.flac,eames was so intent on his own purpose and so fully occupied with the difficulty of the task before him that he could hardly receive missus dale's tidings with all the interest which they deserved unpack them all again he said
8625,5867-48852-0002.flac,but the squire preferred walking and in this way they were disposed of soon after breakfast john had it in his mind to get bell to himself for half an hour and hold a conference with her but it either happened that lady julia was too keen in her duties as a hostess
8626,5867-48852-0077.flac,missus dale had felt from the first that eames was coming too soon that the earl and the squire together were making an effort to cure the wound too quickly after its infliction that time should have been given to her girl to recover
8627,5867-48852-0042.flac,and for the moment silenced him you think he would have a better career in london said lily speaking under the influence of her superior presence of mind she had certainly shown defective judgment in desiring her mother not to leave them alone
8628,5867-48852-0019.flac,to be sure this way or that way or any way who's so welcome mister john i envies you i envies you more than i envies any man if i could ha got him by the scruff of the neck i'd a treated him jist like any worman i would indeed he was wormin i
8629,5867-48852-0107.flac,do you mean to cut it out from your heart never i would if i could but i never shall keep to it as to a great treasure it will be a joy to you in after years and not to sorrow
8630,5867-48852-0014.flac,was it not singular that all the evil things which he in his mind had meditated for the man had fallen upon him crosbie had lost his love he had so proved himself to be a villain that his name might not be so much as mentioned
8631,5867-48852-0023.flac,tell me mister john did you give it him well when you got him i heard you did two black eyes and all his face one mash af gore and hopkins who was by no means a young man stiffly put himself into a fighting attitude
8632,1098-133695-0072.flac,who if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled
8633,1098-133695-0044.flac,and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again the sentiment of these reflexions was very just
8634,1098-133695-0012.flac,with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large license to extravagance her cousin used as the phrase is to chafe her
8635,1098-133695-0043.flac,a greek bath's relief to stick over my chimney piece the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand and i'm told to walk in and admire my poor boy you've been sadly ungrateful
8636,1098-133695-0080.flac,it's impossible i should wait for you missus touchett answered
8637,1098-133695-0033.flac,the father and son had been close companions and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business
8638,1098-133695-0024.flac,and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaf
8639,1098-133695-0013.flac,he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred
8640,1098-133695-0019.flac,and enter the private apartments it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order it was but half hospitality to let her remain outside
8641,1098-133695-0089.flac,isabel considered i'm not vexed but i'm surprised and a good deal mystified wasn't it proper i should remain in the drawing room not in the least young girls here indecent houses
8642,1098-133695-0081.flac,ralph will light my candle isabel gaily engaged i'll light your candle do let me light your candle miss archer
8643,1098-133695-0070.flac,cried lord warburton still with his sonorious mirth my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well said ralph she does everything well she touches nothing that she doesn't adorn
8644,1098-133695-0038.flac,he wondered whether he were harbouring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany but he judged that on the whole he was not after he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this and every day he felt a little more sure
8645,1098-133695-0046.flac,but she needed the knowing and his attitude with regard to her though it was contemplative and critical was not judicial he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly
8646,1098-133695-0008.flac,she asked of her aunt when you criticise everything here you should have a point of view yours doesn't seem to be american you thought everything over there so disagreeable when i criticise i have mine it's thoroughly american
8647,1098-133695-0006.flac,isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness
8648,1098-133695-0007.flac,she was very critical herself it was incidental to her age her sex and her nationality but she was very sentimental as well and there was something in missus touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing now what is your point of view
8649,1098-133695-0086.flac,missus touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again
8650,1098-133695-0088.flac,nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt for himself he was annoyed at his mother though he thought she was right above stairs the two ladies separated at missus touchett's door isabel had said nothing on her way up
8651,1098-133695-0040.flac,which he had always greatly admired if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order a character like that he said to himself
8652,1098-133695-0082.flac,only i beg it shall not be before midnight
8653,1098-133695-0001.flac,her gouty uncle received very little company and missus touchett not having cultivated the relations with her husband's neighbours was not warranted in expecting visits from them she had however a peculiar taste she liked to receive cards
8654,1098-133695-0005.flac,isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt
8655,1098-133695-0061.flac,had been that she should see a great many people when ralph said to her as he had done several times i wonder you find this endurable you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends
8656,1098-133695-0075.flac,the first impression he had made on her had had weight but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him though quite without luridity as a hero of romance
8657,1098-133695-0068.flac,the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well but i needn't ask that he said since you've been handling the oars i've been rowing a little isabel answered but how should you know it
8658,1098-133695-0026.flac,i don't know what's the matter with you she observed to him once but i suspect you're a great humbug that's your privilege ralph answered who had not been used to being so crudely addressed i don't know what you care for
8659,1098-133695-0074.flac,he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow during this period he addressed many of his remarks to isabel who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace she found herself liking him extremely
8660,1098-133695-0031.flac,the old man had been gravely ill in the spring and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with just now he appeared disburdened of pain but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy
8661,1098-133695-0059.flac,the place itself was sovereign her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered her idea of cousins having tended to gloom then
8662,1098-133695-0073.flac,had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof lord warburton not only spent the night at gardencourt but he was persuaded to remain over the second day and when the second day was ended
8663,1098-133695-0029.flac,at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate had refreshed and quickened them given them wings and something to fly for
8664,1098-133695-0066.flac,oh no they're not all like him
8665,1098-133695-0050.flac,they took a boat on the river the dear little river as isabel called it where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape or drove over the country in a phaeton a low capacious thick wheeled phaeton
8666,1098-133695-0071.flac,it makes one want to be touched miss archer lord warburton declared
8667,1098-133695-0023.flac,she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points in fact the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pear
8668,1098-133695-0058.flac,he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times she had hoped she should see him again hoped too that she should see a few others gardencourt was not dull
8669,1098-133695-0000.flac,as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it but in fact the british public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer whose fortune had dropped her as her cousin said into the dullest house in england
8670,1098-133695-0035.flac,but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets
8671,1098-133695-0032.flac,who was waiting to take him off his guard if the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him that his own name would be the first grimly called
8672,1098-133695-0083.flac,and transferred them coldly to her niece
8673,1098-133695-0085.flac,i must take it as i find it can't i stay with my own cousin isabel inquired i'm not aware that lord warburton is your cousin perhaps i had better go to bed the visitor suggested that will arrange it
8674,1098-133695-0054.flac,but the two for the most part sat silent the old man with his head back and his eyes closed his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles
8675,1098-133695-0025.flac,if her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said
8676,1098-133695-0045.flac,his cousin was a very brilliant girl
8677,1098-133695-0064.flac,isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases
8678,1098-133695-0041.flac,a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature its finer than the finest work of art than a greek bass relief
8679,1098-133695-0052.flac,full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find past cottages thatched and timbered past ale houses latticed and sanded past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks
8680,1098-133695-0053.flac,between hedgerows made thick by midsummer when they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn
8681,1098-133695-0036.flac,he bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that of the two the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy
8682,1098-133695-0028.flac,even that i should be very glad ah well i should hope so the young man exclaimed isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth he thought a great deal about her she was constantly present to his mind
8683,1098-133695-0027.flac,i don't think you care for anything you don't really care for england when you praise it you don't care for america even when you pretend to abuse it i care for nothing but you dear cousin said ralph if i could believe
8684,1098-133695-0067.flac,said isabel because i'm sure he's nice
8685,1098-133695-0022.flac,she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation she defended england against his mother but when ralph sang its praises on purpose as she said to work her up
8686,1098-133695-0017.flac,it keeps the sounds of the worlds from reaching the private apartments and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within
8687,1098-133695-0065.flac,well now there's a specimen he said to her as they walked up from the river side as he recognized lord warburton a specimen of what asked the girl a specimen of an english gentleman do you mean they're all like him
8688,1098-133695-0056.flac,of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable with
8689,1098-133695-0049.flac,a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in isabel's somewhat lugubrious provision of the climate and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness
8690,1098-133695-0084.flac,you're not you're not at your bleset albany my dear isabel rose blushing i wish i were she said oh i say mother ralph broke out
8691,1098-133695-0009.flac,there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them you may say that doesn't make them very numerous american never in the world that's shockingly narrow my point of view thank god is personal
8692,1098-133695-0090.flac,don't sit alone with te gentleman late at night you are very right to tell me then said isabel i don't understand it but i'm very glad to know it i shall always tell you her aunt answered whenever i see you taking what seems to me to much liberty
8693,1098-133695-0020.flac,it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched he drew a caricature of her
8694,1098-133695-0051.flac,but which he had now ceased to enjoy isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways
8695,1098-133695-0021.flac,in the folds of the national banner isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so but she nevertheless
8696,1098-133695-0042.flac,than a gothic cathedral it's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it i had never been more blue more bored than for a week before she came i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen
8697,1098-133695-0063.flac,little however for the present had come of his offers and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help
8698,1098-133695-0004.flac,but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure really very gratuitous to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country
8699,1098-133695-0055.flac,one day however a visitor had arrived the two young persons after spending an hour on the river strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation
8700,1098-133695-0048.flac,and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed he was not a great walker but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin
8701,1098-133695-0069.flac,oh i know he doesn't row he's too lazy said his lordship indicating ralph touchette with a laugh he has a good excuse for his laziness isabel rejoined lowering her voice a little ah he has a good excuse for everything
8702,1098-133695-0091.flac,yes i think i'm very fond of them but i always want to know the things one shouldn't do so as to do them asked her aunt
8703,1098-133695-0010.flac,isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging but it would not have sounded well for her to say so
8704,1098-133695-0016.flac,his adopted and his native country his charming new found cousin i keep a band of music in my ante room he said once to her it has orders to play without stopping it renders me two excellent services
8705,1098-133695-0077.flac,that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test
8706,1098-133695-0076.flac,with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities it's very nice to know two such charming people as those she said meaning by those her cousin and her cousin's friend it must be added moreover
8707,1098-133695-0060.flac,her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad
8708,1098-133695-0039.flac,lord warburton had been right about her she was a really interesting little figure ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities
8709,1098-133695-0002.flac,for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard she flattered herself that she was a very just woman
8710,1098-133695-0079.flac,the occasion wore to her sense a festive character and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early so without further thought she replied very simply need i go dear aunt i'll come up in half an hour
8711,1098-133695-0047.flac,isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own whenever she executes them said ralph may i be there to see it devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place
8712,1098-133695-0034.flac,at the prospect of losing his great motive ralph lost indeed his one inspiration
8713,1098-133695-0078.flac,but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour and then rising observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentleman good night isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed
8714,1098-133695-0018.flac,the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling
8715,1098-133695-0011.flac,would savour of immodesty even of arrogance
8716,1098-133695-0003.flac,and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing she had played no social part as mistress of gardencourt and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings
8717,1098-133695-0030.flac,poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy his outlook habitually sombre lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud
8718,1098-133695-0037.flac,which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first but of the two triumphs that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which with all abatements he enjoyed
8719,1098-133695-0015.flac,his useless life his fantastic mother
8720,1098-133695-0087.flac,ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick he had been watching her it had seemed to him her temper was involved an accident that might be interesting but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little
8721,1098-133695-0014.flac,of laughing at all things beginning with himself such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son this gentleman's weak lungs
8722,1098-133695-0057.flac,he had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked as the father and son often invited him to do for a dinner and a lodging isabel seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival had discovered in this brief space that she liked him
8723,1098-133695-0062.flac,though you would never suppose it when he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray
8724,3857-182317-0014.flac,then no matter how harmless we treat them as outlaws and those of us who are specially well brought up shoot them for fun some might be our friends we don't wish it we keep them all terrorized
8725,3857-182317-0007.flac,he was plastic too he had learned to eat many foods and endure many climates once some say this race explored the globe their bones are found everywhere in south america even
8726,3857-182317-0033.flac,in addition to these a race to be great needs some hunger some itch to spur it up the hard path we lately have learned to call evolution the love of toil in the ants and of craft in cats are examples
8727,3857-182317-0026.flac,torn between those two voices wailing loudly at night by a river in his puzzled distress my poor far off brother
8728,3857-182317-0006.flac,and well should the elephant know it he had the best chance of all wiser even than the lion or the wisest of apes his wisdom furthermore was benign where theirs was sinister consider his dignity his poise and skill
8729,3857-182317-0030.flac,we attain no power over nature till we learn natural laws and our lordship depends on the adroitness with which we learn and conform adroitness however is merely an ability to win
8730,3857-182317-0013.flac,all species must surrender unconditionally those are our terms and come and live and barns alongside us or on us as parasites the creatures that want to live a life of their own we call wild if wild
8731,3857-182317-0011.flac,just as ants are too energetic and cats too shrewd for their own highest good so the elephants suffer from too much patience their exhibitions of it may seem superb such power and such restraint combined are noble
8732,3857-182317-0028.flac,some quenchless desire to urge them on and on and also adaptability of a thousand kinds to their environment the rhinocerous cares little for adaptability he slogs through the world but we
8733,3857-182317-0002.flac,one must grant they are vassals not rulers they are too paracitic the one willing servant class of the world and we have betrayed them by making under simians of them
8734,3857-182317-0022.flac,and all that while the contest for leadership blindly went on without any species making use of this obvious aid the lesson to be learned was simple the reward was the rule of a planet yet only one species our own
8735,3857-182317-0001.flac,but they have lost their chance of kingship through worshipping us the dog's finer qualities can't be praised too warmly there is a purity about his devotion which makes mere men feel speechlessbut with all love for dogs
8736,3857-182317-0024.flac,instead of sticking to instinct now sticking to instinct has its disadvantages but so has using reason whichever faculty you use the other atrophes and partly deserts you we are trying to use both
8737,3857-182317-0005.flac,and grossness delays one's achievement it takes so much time the snake too though wise has a way of eating himself into stupors if super snake men had had banquets they would have been too vast to describe
8738,3857-182317-0032.flac,by some longing that pushes them forward in defeat and in darkness all creatures wish to live and to perpetuate their species of course but those two wishes alone evidently do not carry any race far
8739,3857-182317-0015.flac,when one of us conquering monkey men enters the woods most animals that sent him slink away or race off in a panic it is not that we have planned this deliberately but they know what we're like race by race they have been slaughtered
8740,3857-182317-0027.flac,and thereafter achieve a high civilization but that wasn't the problem the real problem
8741,3857-182317-0020.flac,when an elephant plucks off a branch and swishes his flanks and thus keeps away insects he is using a tool but he does it only by a vague and haphazard association of ideas if he once became a conscious user of tools
8742,3857-182317-0018.flac,the elephant is stupid when it comes to learning how to use tools so are all other species except our own isn't it strange a tool in the most primitive sense is any object lying around

8746,3857-182317-0003.flac,loving us they let us stop their developing in tune with their natures and they've patiently tried ever since to adopt ways of ours they have done it too but of course they can't get far it's not their own road
8747,3857-182317-0000.flac,some had over trustful characters like the seals or exploitable characters like cows and chickens and sheep such creatures sentenced themselves to be captives by their lack of ambition dogs they had more spirit
8748,3857-182317-0012.flac,more live and let live in allowing other species to stay here our way is to kill good and bad male and female and babies till the few last survivors lie hidden away from our guns
8749,3857-182317-0019.flac,that can obviously be used as an instrument for this or that purpose many creatures use objects as materials as birds use twigs for nests but the step that no animal takes is learning freely to use things as instruments
8750,3857-182317-0029.flac,we are experts adaptability is what we depend on we talk of our mastery of nature which sounds very grand but the fact is we respectfully adapt ourselves first to her ways

8752,3857-182317-0010.flac,and that the monkey men were getting ahead were they too great minded and decent to exterminate their puny rivals it may have been their tolerance and patience that betrayed them they wait too long before they resent an imposition or insult
8753,3857-182317-0016.flac,soon all will be gone we give neither freedom nor life room to those we defeat if we had been as strong as the elephants we might have been kinder when great power comes naturally to people
8754,3857-182317-0017.flac,it is used more urbanely we use it as parvenues do because that's what we are the elephant being born to it is easy going confident tolerant he would have been a more humane king
8755,3857-182317-0021.flac,he would of course go much further we ourselves who are so good at it now were slow enough in beginning think of the long epochs that passed before it entered our heads
8756,3857-182317-0025.flac,but we still don't know which has the more value a sudden vision comes to me of one of the first far away ape men who tried to use reason instead of instinct as a guide for his conduct i imagine him perched in his tree
8757,3857-182317-0031.flac,back of it there must be some spur to make us use our adroitness why don't we all die or give up when we're sick of the world because the love of life is reenforced in most energized beings

8759,3857-180923-0029.flac,and every town among us has known some of them ever since among its leading figures while some in quarters far distant have also attained to honors and responsibilities as the records show
8760,3857-180923-0028.flac,there were names which have been for years among the best known and most honored in this state and there were those of outcasts and wrecks a large part of these men came back after their service ended to resume the peaceful life of citizenship

8775,3857-180923-0025.flac,though the large addition to its numbers which the increase in size necessitated made it perhaps somewhat less homogeneous than at first it did not greatly alter its essential characteristics

8778,3857-180923-0000.flac,the preceding pages have outlined the career of the second connecticut heavy artillery and have narrated some of the more memorable events of its history enough has been told of what it did to furnish grounds for deducing what it was
8779,3857-180923-0017.flac,sergeant theodore c glazier was a graduate of trinity in the class of eighteen sixty and was a tutor there when he enlisted he was later made colonel of a colored regiment and served with credit in that capacity

8783,3857-180923-0001.flac,but to deal with the regiment on the personal side is hardly possible within the limits of such a sketch as this though it is a matter that cannot be entirely passed by

8785,3857-180923-0021.flac,a complete history of the organization would also give a large place to the association of its veterans formed shortly after the war whose frequent gatherings have more than a superficial likeness to the reunions of college classes
8786,3857-180923-0024.flac,it was made up of men of almost all conditions of life and of widely different ages though naturally with young men in a large majority of mechanics from the hositonic and nagatuk valleys and farmers boys from the hills of men of education and men of none

8788,3857-182315-0029.flac,no derision of eugenics no thieves perhaps no crime at all ants are good citizens they place group interests first but they carry it so far they have few or no political rights
8789,3857-182315-0016.flac,there are also queer limitations three in those distant invisible epochs before men existed before even the proud missing lynk strutted around through the woods
8790,3857-182315-0030.flac,an ant doesn't have the vote apparently he just has his duties this quality may have something to do with their having groups wars the egotism of their individual spirits is allowed scant expression
8791,3857-182315-0044.flac,it is the servant of instinct it would therefore have told the ants that incessant toil was useful and good toil has brought you up from the ruck of things reason would have plausibly said
8792,3857-182315-0012.flac,if a god or some principle of growth had gone that way to work with us he or it might have moulded us in much more splendid forms but considering our simian descent it has done very well
8793,3857-182315-0024.flac,still those frowsy unlovely hordes of apes and monkeys were so completely lacking in signs of kingship they were so flighty too in their ways and had so little purpose and so much love for absurd and idle chatter
8794,3857-182315-0020.flac,familiar with the ways of evolution elsewhere in the universe we naturally should have wondered what course it would take on this earth even in this out of the way corner of the cosmos we might have reflected and on this tiny star
8795,3857-182315-0036.flac,regressively so their ways are more fixed than those of the old egyptians and their industry is painful to think of its hyper chinese but we must remember this is a simian comment
8796,3857-182315-0011.flac,what could you expect two if we had been made directly from clay the way it says in the bible and had therefore inherited no intermediate characteristics
8797,3857-182315-0022.flac,and how great a development could they attain to thereafter
8798,3857-182315-0032.flac,i wish i could truly say inhuman but conversely ants are absolutely unselfish within the community they are skilful ingenious their nests and buildings are relatively larger than man's
8799,3857-182315-0019.flac,and kept us in cages or show us for sport in the forest while they ruled the world so potter and i developing this train of thought began to imagine we had lived many ages ago and somehow or other had alighted here from some older planet
8800,3857-182315-0026.flac,the bees or the ants might have seemed to us more promising their smallness of size was not necessarily too much of a handicap they could have made poison their weapon for the subjugation of rivals
8801,3857-182315-0004.flac,sunday afternoon crowds they were not going anywhere they were just strolling up and down staring at each other and talking there were thousands and thousands of them
8802,3857-182315-0008.flac,and yet at other times i too feel like a spectator an alien but even then i had never felt so alien or despairing as potter let's remember i said it's a simian civilization
8803,3857-182315-0001.flac,i take a jealous pride in my simian ancestry i like to think that i was once a magnificent hairy fellow living in the trees and that my frame has come down through geological time via sea jelly and worms
8804,3857-182315-0006.flac,are any other beings ever found in such masses but vermin aimless staring vacant minded look at them
8805,3857-182315-0038.flac,and instead of merely struggling with nature for it they also fight other ants the custom of plunder seems to be a part of most of their wars this has gone on for ages among them and continues to day
8806,3857-182315-0005.flac,i turned and asked why what about them i wasn't sure whether he had an idea or a headache other creatures don't do it he replied with a discouraged expression
8807,3857-182315-0013.flac,the only people who are disappointed in us are those who still believe that clay story or who unconsciously still let it color their thinking there certainly seems to be a power at work in the world
8808,3857-182315-0040.flac,but that would not help for long unless they could abolish the love of it ants seem to care even more for property than we do ourselves we men are inclined to ease up a little when we have all we need
8809,3857-182315-0018.flac,certain groups sought the head ship many strange forgotten dynasties rose met defiance and fell in the end it was our ancestors who won and became simian kings and bequeathed a whole planet to us
8810,3857-182315-0042.flac,conceivably they might have developed inquiring minds but this would have run against their strongest instincts the ant is knowing and wise but he doesn't know enough to take a vacation
8811,3857-182315-0033.flac,the scientists speak of their paved streets vaulted halls their hundreds of different domesticated animals their pluck and intelligence their individual initiative their chest and industrious lives
8812,3857-182315-0007.flac,i can get no sense whatever of individual worth or of value in men as a race when i see them like this it makes one almost despair of civilization i thought this over for a while
8813,3857-182315-0010.flac,eagles for instance instead of broadly speaking from ape like or monkeyish beings being of simian stock we had simian traits our development naturally bore the marks of our origin
8814,3857-182315-0034.flac,darwin said the ant's brain was one of the most marvellous atoms in the world perhaps more so than the brain of man yes of present day man who for thousands and thousands of years has had so much more chance to develop his brain
8815,3857-182315-0027.flac,and in these orderly insects there are obviously a capacity for labor and co operative labor at that which could carry them far we all know that they have a marked genius great gifts of their own
8816,3857-182315-0014.flac,by virtue of which every living thing grows and develops and it tends towards splendour seeds become trees and weak little nations grow great but the push or the force that is doing this the yeast as it were
8817,3857-182315-0021.flac,it may be of interest to consider the trend of events we should have tried to appraise the different species as they wandered around each with its own set of good and bad characteristics which group we'd have wondered would ever contrive to rule all the rest
8818,3857-182315-0031.flac,so the egotism of the groups is extremely ferocious and active is this one of the reasons why ants fight so much we have seen the same phenomenon occur in certain nations of men and the ants commit atrocities in and after their battles that are
8819,3857-182315-0043.flac,would they have been able therewith to rule their instincts or to stop work long enough to examine themselves or the universe or to dream of any noble development probably not reason is seldom or never the ruler
8820,3857-182315-0037.flac,the instincts of the species that you and i belong to are of an opposite kind and that makes it hard for us to judge ants fairly but we and the ants are alike in one matter the strong love of property
8821,3857-182315-0015.flac,has to work in and on certain definite kinds of material because this yeast is in us there may be great and undreamed of possibilities awaiting mankind but because of our line of descent
8822,3857-182315-0023.flac,we might first have considered the leemers or apes they had hands esthetically viewed the poor simians were simply grotesque but travellers who knew other planets might have known what beauty may spring from an uncouth beginning in this magic universe
8823,3857-182315-0009.flac,potter was staring disgustedly at some vaudeville sign boards yes i said those for example are distinctively simian why should you feel disappointment at something inevitable and i went on to argue that it wasn't as though we were descended from
8824,3857-182315-0025.flac,they are not easily left behind even after long stages and they form a terrible obstacle to all high advancement
8825,3857-182315-0041.flac,they can't bear to stop they keep right on working this means that ants do not contemplate they heed nothing outside of their own little rounds it is almost as though their fondness for labor has closed fast their minds
8826,3857-182315-0035.flac,a thoughtful observer would have weighed all these excellent qualities when we think of these creatures as little men which is all wrong of course we see they have their faults to our eyes they seem too orderly for instance
8827,3857-182315-0028.flac,in a civilization of super ants or bees there would have been no problem of the hungry unemployed no poverty no unstable government no riots no strikes for short hours
8828,3857-182315-0045.flac,it's by virtue of feverish toil that you have become what you are being endlessly industrious is the best road for you to the heights
8829,3857-182315-0000.flac,how i hate the man who talks about the brute creation with an ugly emphasis on brute as for me i am proud of my close kinship with other animals
8830,3857-182315-0017.flac,little realizing how we his great grandsons would smile wryly at him much as our own descendants may shudder at us ages hence the various animals were desperately competing for power they couldn't or didn't live as equals
8831,3857-182315-0039.flac,raids ferocious combats and loot are part of an ant's regular life ant reformers if there were any might lay this to their property sense and talk of abolishing property as a cure for the evil
8832,3857-182315-0003.flac,last sunday potter took me out driving along upper broadway where those long rows of tall new apartment houses were built a few years ago it was a mild afternoon and great crowds of people were out
8833,3857-182315-0002.flac,and amphioxus fish dynosaurs and apes who would exchange these for the pallid couple in the garden of eden w n p barbellion
8834,6078-54007-0049.flac,i know not why it is said he but that story of yours my friend brings to my mind a story of a man whom i once knew a great magician in his time and a necromancer and a chemist and an alchemist
8835,6078-54007-0040.flac,and all was as sweet and happy as a spring day but at the end of that time the fiddler began to wonder what was to be seen in the castle the queen was very fond of him and was glad enough to show him all the fine things that were to be seen
8836,6078-54007-0044.flac,and the spark of light at the far end as though the sun were shining he cocked his head to one side and listened yes said he i think i hear the water rushing but i am not sure i will just go a little further in
8837,6078-54007-0037.flac,and so she had come out into the garden for a bit of rest and there she sat under the shade of an apple tree fanning herself and crying when swash down fell the fiddler into the apple tree and down fell a dozen apples
8838,6078-54007-0021.flac,everything the fiddler wanted came to his hand he lived high and slept soft and warm and never knew what it was to want either more or less or great or small in all of those three or four days he did nothing but enjoy himself
8839,6078-54007-0046.flac,away flew the fiddler like a bullet and there was ill luck carrying him by the belt again away they sped
8840,6078-54007-0034.flac,by and by he managed to screw his head around and look up and there it was ill luck that had im i thought so said the fiddler and then he gave over kicking well on and on they flew over hill and valley over moor and mountain
8841,6078-54007-0050.flac,and a rhetorician an astronomer an astrologer and a philosopher as well tis a long list of excellency said old bidpie
8842,6078-54007-0048.flac,or else i would have been a king if it had not been for ill luck and that is the way we all of us talk doctor faustus had sat all the while neither drinking ale nor smoking tobacco but with his hands folded and in silence
8843,6078-54007-0041.flac,you must not ask or wish to know should you open that door ill luck will be sure to overtake you pooh said the fiddler i don't care to know anyhow and off they went hand in hand yes
8844,6078-54007-0045.flac,and listen and so he entered and closed the door behind him well he went on and on until pop there he was out at the farther end and before he knew what he was about he had stepped out upon the sea shore
8845,6078-54007-0047.flac,until the fiddler's head grew so dizzy that he had to shut his eyes suddenly ill luck let him drop and down he fell thump bump on the hard ground then he opened his eyes and sat up
8846,6078-54007-0036.flac,and all had been weeping and woe though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again and this was the reason why the king of that country had died and no one was left behind him but the queen
8847,6078-54007-0025.flac,there in a corner by the wall was a great trap door of iron the old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it he lifted the door and then went down a steep flight of stone steps and the fiddler followed close at his heels
8848,6078-54007-0043.flac,why look says he it is just like the door at the rich man's house over yonder i wonder if it is the same inside as outside and he opened the door and peeped in yes there was the long passage
8849,6078-54007-0020.flac,and so you shall live with me as long as i live and after i am gone everything that i have shall be yours the fittler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth as though he would never shut either again
8850,6078-54007-0038.flac,you fell from heaven for i saw it with my eyes and heard it with my ears i see how it is now you were sent hither from heaven to be my husband and my husband you shall be you shall be king of this country half and half with me as queen
8851,6078-54007-0035.flac,until they came to another garden and there ill luck let the fiddler drop swash down he fell into the top of an apple tree and there he hung in the branches it was the garden of a royal castle
8852,6078-54007-0029.flac,perhaps i can see what is there without opening the door so down he took the key and off he marched to the garden he opened the trap door and went down the steep steps to the room below there was the door at the end of the room
8853,6078-54007-0022.flac,with might and main but by and by he began to wonder where all the good things came from then before long he fell to pestering the old man with questions about the matter at first the old man put him off with short answers
8854,6078-54007-0026.flac,down below it was as light as day for in the centre of the room hung a great lamp that shone with a bright light
8855,6078-54007-0031.flac,he heard a sound like the waves beating on the shore well says he this is the most curious thing i have seen for a long time since i have come so far i may as well see the end of it
8856,6078-54007-0042.flac,that was a very fine thing to say but before an hour had gone by the fiddler's head began to hum and buzz like a beehive i don't believe said he there would be a grain of harm in my peeping inside that door all the same
8857,6078-54007-0023.flac,but the fiddler was a master hand at finding out anything he wanted to know he dinned and drummed and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer so at last the old man said that he would show him the treasure house where all his wealth came from
8858,6078-54007-0033.flac,there he stood on the seashore with the waves beating and dashing on the rocks he stood looking and wondering to find himself in such a place when all of a sudden something came with a wiz and a rush and caught him by the belt and away he flew like a bullet
8859,6078-54007-0030.flac,but when he came to look there was no keyhole to it
8860,6078-54007-0027.flac,you must never open that door yonder at the back of the room should you do so ill luck will be sure to overtake you oh no the fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as opening the door
8861,6078-54007-0032.flac,so he entered the passageway and closed the door behind him he went on and on and the spark of light kept growing larger and larger and by and by pop out he came at the other end of the passage sure enough
8862,6078-54007-0039.flac,and shall sit on a throne beside me you can guess whether or not that was music to the fiddler's ears so the princes were sent packing and the fiddler was married to the queen and reigned in that country well three or four days passed
8863,6078-54007-0051.flac,nay said saint george everything must have a name it hath no name said doctor faustus but i shall give it a name and it shall be
8864,6078-54007-0028.flac,and out into the sunlight again it took him maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had brought up with him after he had done that he began to wonder what was inside of the little door at the back of the room first he wondered
8865,6078-54007-0024.flac,and at that the fiddler was tickled beyond measure
8866,6078-54007-0011.flac,an st pop out came ill luck along with it plague take the fiddler say ay listen says ill luck it has been many a long day that i have been in that hazel nut and you are the man that has let me out
8867,6078-54007-0005.flac,even if it be through a keyhole now is that so yes says ill luck it is well look now friend says saint nicholas
8868,6078-54007-0009.flac,so says saint nicholas that's a piece of work well done then he tossed the hazel nut under the roots of an oak tree near by and went his way and that is how the story begins well
8869,6078-54007-0006.flac,yes says ill luck i could indeed i should like to see you says saint nicholas for then i should be of a mind to believe what people say of you well says ill luck i have not much time to be pottering and playing upon jack's fiddle but to oblige an old friend
8870,6078-54007-0014.flac,all built of white marble with a fountain in front and peacock strutting about on the lawn well the fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a bit and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house at the end of the garden
8871,6078-54007-0017.flac,do not say that sit down to the table and eat and when i have told you all you will say it was not ill luck but good luck that brought you the fiddler had his own mind about that but all the same down he sat at the table
8872,6078-54007-0007.flac,then what do you think saint nicholas did
8873,6078-54007-0001.flac,for he had a notion to find out whether things were going on nowadays as they one time did by and by he came to a cross road and who should he see sitting there but ill luck himself ill luck's face was as gray as ashes
8874,6078-54007-0016.flac,the table was spread with a feast that smelled so good that it brought tears to the fiddler's eyes and water to his mouth and all the plates were of pure gold the little old man sat alone but another place was spread
8875,6078-54007-0019.flac,and without wife or child and this morning i said to myself that the first body that came to my house i would take for a son or a daughter as the case might be you are the first
8876,6078-54007-0010.flac,nobody met with ill luck but one day who should come traveling that way
8877,6078-54007-0013.flac,then away he flew to attend to other matters of greater need when the fiddler had gathered his wits together and himself to his feet he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and fruit trees and marble walks and what not
8878,6078-54007-0002.flac,and his hair as white as snow
8879,6078-54007-0018.flac,and fell to with knife and fork at the good things as though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of sundays i am the richest man in the world says the little old man after a while i'm glad to hear it says the fiddler you may well be sayd the old man
8880,6078-54007-0003.flac,and two great wings grew out of his shoulders for he flies fast and comes quickly to those whom he visits does ill luck
8881,6078-54007-0008.flac,and no sooner had ill luck entered the nut than he stuck the plug in the hole and there was man's enemy
8882,6078-54007-0012.flac,for once in a way i will do a good turn to a poor human body therewith and without giving the fiddler time to speak a word ill luck caught him up by the belt and whiz away he flew like a bullet
8883,6078-54007-0015.flac,he entered the door and nobody said no to him then he passed through one room after another and each was finer than the one he left behind many servants stood around but they only bowed and never asked whence he came
8884,6078-54007-0004.flac,which he kept cracking and eating as he trudged along the road and just then he came upon one with a worm hole in it when he saw ill luck it came into his head to do a good turn to poor sorrowful man good morning ill luck says he
8885,6078-54007-0000.flac,ill luck and the fiddler once upon a time saint nicholas came down into the world to take a peep at the old place and see how things looked in the spring time on he stepped along the road to the town where he used to live
8886,6078-54013-0062.flac,for many a long day and never knew that a great treasure of silver and gold was hidden beneath it until a few days ago there came an angel
8887,6078-54013-0040.flac,but the next morning before the dawning of the day the travelling companion was stirring again
8888,6078-54013-0024.flac,then when all but they too were tight and fast asleep
8889,6078-54013-0051.flac,but suddenly catching the widow's son by the collar he lifted him and flung him into the black rushing water splash went the young man and then away he went whirling over rocks and waterfalls there cried the comrade
8890,6078-54013-0056.flac,the garden and the torrent and all were gone and nothing was left but a naked plan covered over with the bones of those who had come that way before seeking the fruit which the travelling servant had sought it was a long time before the servant found his way back into the world again
8891,6078-54013-0000.flac,once upon a time there was a servant who served a wise man
8892,6078-54013-0079.flac,come friend let us have it stop a bit said fortunatus what is this story mostly about it is said ali baba about two men betwixt whom there was
8893,6078-54013-0070.flac,my wife and all my friends fell out with me and we quarrelled so that they all left me but though i knew it not at the time your comrade was an angel and took the ring away with him and now i am as happy as i was sorrowful before
8894,6078-54013-0031.flac,no matter for that said the travelling companion we can go no farther to night so you must let us in and hide us the best you may and in he went as he said with the servant at his heels
8895,6078-54013-0053.flac,he found his tongue at last and all that he had bottled up
8896,6078-54013-0071.flac,rap tap tap he knocked at the door and the wise man who had been his master opened to him
8897,6078-54013-0045.flac,in this cottage lived a widow and her only son and they also made the travellers welcome and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed this time the travelling comrade did neither good nor ill to those of the house
8898,6078-54013-0066.flac,there happened to be one of the household standing at the door and he knew the servant as the companion of that one who had stolen the ruby ring up he came and laid hold of the servant by the caller calling to his companions that he had caught one of the thieves
8899,6078-54013-0018.flac,there the travelling companion stopped and drawing out a little pipe from under his jacket
8900,6078-54013-0043.flac,all was a red blaze behind them
8901,6078-54013-0015.flac,and say not a word do you agree to that yes said the servant i do very well said his new comrade then let us be jogging
8902,6078-54013-0073.flac,and then jogged all the way back home again to cook cabbage and onions and pot herbs and to make broth for wiser men than himself to sup
8903,6078-54013-0008.flac,why thus said the second
8904,6078-54013-0001.flac,day after day time in and time out for seven years in those years the servant was well enough contented but no one likes to abide in the same place forever and so one day he took it into his head that he would like to go out into the world
8905,6078-54013-0035.flac,he drew from his pocket the ruby ring which he had stolen from the sorrowful young man's finger
8906,6078-54013-0026.flac,to see what his comrade was about
8907,6078-54013-0019.flac,to listen to the music well he played and played until by and by the door opened and out came a serving man ho piper said he
8908,6078-54013-0044.flac,on they jogged and by the time evening was at hand they had come to a neat cottage
8909,6078-54013-0030.flac,up stepped the servant's comrade and knocked upon the door rat tap tap by and by it was opened a crack and there stood an ugly old woman blear eyed and crooked and gnarled as a winner twig
8910,6078-54013-0022.flac,thereupon he drew out his pipe and began to play and it was such a tune as no man ever listened to before he played and he played and after awhile one after another of those who listened to him began to get drowsy first they winked
8911,6078-54013-0072.flac,very well said the wise man come in and shut the door and for all i know the travelling servant is there to this day for he is not the only one in the world who has come in sight of the fruit of happiness
8912,6078-54013-0067.flac,into the house they hauled the poor servant and into the same room where he had been before and there sat the young man at a grand feast with his wife and all of his friends around him but when the young man saw the poor serving man he came to him
8913,6078-54013-0065.flac,and the next day came to the town and to the house of the sorrowful young man there lo and behold instead of being dark and silent as it was before all was ablaze with light and noisy with the sound of rejoicing and merriment
8914,6078-54013-0060.flac,but to bring an apple for me also then the poor travelling servant began to thump his head he saw well enough through the millstone now and that he too might have had one of the fruit if he had but held his tongue a little longer
8915,6078-54013-0068.flac,and took him by the hand and set him beside himself at the table
8916,6078-54013-0017.flac,the servant's companion entered the gate as though he knew the place right well and led the way up one street and down another until by and by they came to a noble house that stood a little apart by itself with gardens of flowers and fruit trees all around it
8917,6078-54013-0020.flac,where dozens of servants were serving a fine feast but only one man sat at the table a young man with a face so sorrowful that it made a body's heart ache to look upon him can you play good music piper said he
8918,6078-54013-0028.flac,but the next day they jogged on together again until by and by they came to a great forest there they wandered up and down till night came upon them and found them still stumbling onward through the darkness
8919,6078-54013-0069.flac,it was the ring of discord that bred strife wherever it came
8920,6078-54013-0042.flac,he gathered together a great heap of straw and sticks of wood and stuffed all under the corner of the house then he struck a light and set fire to it
8921,6078-54013-0027.flac,none was more ugly than this to bewitch the poor sorrowful young man into a sleep and then to rob him of the ruby ring
8922,6078-54013-0047.flac,and my son himself shall go with you to show you the way that is good said the servant's comrade and if he will do so i will pay him well for his trouble so the young man put on his hat and took up his stick
8923,6078-54013-0078.flac,clattered the bottom of his canican against the table
8924,6078-54013-0009.flac,and there he would find a man sitting
8925,6078-54013-0036.flac,then he led the way out of the house and if the serving man had wondered the day before at that which the comrade did he wondered ten times more to see him give so beautiful a ring
8926,6078-54013-0025.flac,and stepping up to the young man took from off his finger a splendid ruby ring as red as blood and as bright as fire and popped the same into his pocket and all the while the serving man stood gaping like a fish
8927,6078-54013-0055.flac,thereupon as he ended speaking he struck his staff upon the ground instantly the earth trembled and the sky darkened overhead until it grew as black as night
8928,6078-54013-0064.flac,he gave it to the captain of the band and after he had gone the robbers fought for it with one another until they were all killed so now the world is rid of them and the travellers can come and go as they please back jogged the travelling servant
8929,6078-54013-0041.flac,for i have a bit of work to do before i leave this place and strange work it was
8930,6078-54013-0012.flac,and wish and whatever one asks for one shall have you may guess that when the servant understood the talk of the ravens he was not slow in making use of what he had heard up he scrambled
8931,6078-54013-0075.flac,i would as leaf as not i liked the story well enough piped up the little tailor who had killed seven flies at a blow twas a good enough story of its sort but why does nobody tell a tale of good big giants and of wild boars and of unicorns
8932,6078-54013-0076.flac,such as i killed in my adventures you wot of old ali baba had been sitting with his hands folded and his eyes closed now he opened them and looked at the little tailor
8933,6078-54013-0014.flac,there is one condition you must fulfil many strange things will happen upon our journey between here and there
8934,6078-54013-0058.flac,and she was dressed in clothes fit for a queen to wear shining with gold and silver and precious stones the servant stood and stared like one berift of wits
8935,6078-54013-0005.flac,paying his way with the few pennies he had saved in his seven years of service but for all of his travelling nothing good happened to him until one morning he came to a lonely place where there stood a gallows and there he sat him down to rest
8936,6078-54013-0063.flac,the next morning the poor servant jogged alon on his homeward way more sad and downcast than ever and by evening he had come to the robbers den in the thick woods and there the old woman came running to the door to meet him
8937,6078-54013-0038.flac,and there the comrade knocked upon the door and asked for lodging
8938,6078-54013-0048.flac,and off went the three up hill and down dale until by and by they came over the top of the last hill and there below them lay the garden and what a sight it was the leaves shining and glistening like so many jewels in the sunlight
8939,6078-54013-0037.flac,the two travellers came to a little hut neat enough
8940,6078-54013-0023.flac,then they shut their eyes and then they nodded until all were as dumb as logs and as sound asleep as though they would never waken again only the servant and the piper stayed awake for the music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest
8941,6078-54013-0032.flac,trembling like a leaf at what he had heard the old woman gave them some bread and meat to eat and then hid them away in the great empty meal chest in the corner and there they lay as still as mice
8942,6078-54013-0039.flac,nevertheless they made the travellers welcome and set before them the very best that was to be had in the house and after both had eaten and drunk they showed him to a bed in a corner as clean as snow and there they slept the night through
8943,6078-54013-0007.flac,there they began talking to one another and the servant popped the pebble into his mouth to hear what they might say yonder is a traveller in the world said the first raven yes said the second
8944,6078-54013-0046.flac,but in the morning he told the widow whither they were going and asked if she and her son knew the way to the garden where grew the fruit of happiness yes said she that we do for the garden is not a day's journey from here
8945,6078-54013-0061.flac,the house that he had seen the angel set fire to there he beheld masons and carpenters hard at work hacking and hewing and building a fine new house and there he saw the poor man himself standing by giving them orders how is this said the travelling servant
8946,6078-54013-0016.flac,and the time is not too long to get there so all the rest of that day they journeyed onward together until towards evening they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs and tall spires
8947,6078-54013-0003.flac,you have served me faithfully these seven years gone and now that you ask to leave to go you shall go but it is little or nothing in the way of money that i can give you and so you will have to be content with what i can afford
8948,6078-54013-0049.flac,all he could do was to stand and look
8949,6078-54013-0011.flac,the fruit of happiness said the first raven and of what use would the fruit of happiness be to him
8950,6078-54013-0002.flac,to see what kind of a fortune a man might make there for himself
8951,6078-54013-0057.flac,but what a change he beheld it was ha poor cottage no longer but a splendid palace fit for a queen to dwell in
8952,6078-54013-0013.flac,and away he went as fast as his legs could carry him on and on he travelled until he came to the cross roads and the stone cross of which the raven spoke and there sure enough set the traveller
8953,6078-54013-0077.flac,who was as big as a giant and six times as powerful and besides that he added
8954,6078-54013-0074.flac,no offence said the blacksmith i meant not to speak ill of your story come come sir will you not take a pot of ale with me why said saint george somewhat mollified
8955,6078-54013-0010.flac,that man would lead him to the garden
8956,6078-54013-0004.flac,see here is a little pebble and its like is not to be found in the seven kingdoms for whoever holds it in his mouth can hear while he does so
8957,6078-54013-0054.flac,such abuse as he showered upon his travelling companion no man ever listened to before but to all the servants said the other answered never a word until he had stopped for sheer want of breath then poor fool said the travelling companion
8958,6078-54013-0034.flac,how they had cruelly robbed and murdered poor people
8959,6078-54013-0006.flac,and it is just in such an unlikely place as this that a man's best chance of fortune comes to him sometimes as the servant sat there there came two ravens flying and lit upon the cross beam overhead
8960,6078-54013-0050.flac,torrent without a bridge for a body to cross over yonder is what you seek said the young man pointing with his finger and there you can see for yourself the fruit of happiness
8961,6078-54013-0033.flac,by and by in came the gang of thieves with a great noise and uproar and down they sat to their supper
8962,6078-54013-0052.flac,that is your reward for your service
8963,6078-54013-0029.flac,he seemed to doubt nothing nor fear nothing but trudged straight ahead until by and by they saw a light twinkling far away and when they came to it they found a gloomy stone house as ugly as eyes ever looked upon
8964,6078-54013-0021.flac,but suddenly everything went wrong his wife and he fell out and quarrelled until there was no living together and she had to go back to her old home then his companions deserted him and now he lived all alone yours is a hard case said the travelling companion
8965,6078-54013-0059.flac,an angel came and showed the way to my son
8966,3982-182255-0032.flac,unity of the country if therefore mister newberry and mister overend were found to be discussing the corrupt state of their city they only shared in the national sentiments of the moment in fact in the same city hundreds of other citizens
8967,3982-182255-0035.flac,on the expropriation committee itself and worse than that alderman undercut was a butcher in a city that consumed a thousand tons of meat every week and alderman o'hooligan it leaked out was an irishman
8968,3982-182255-0004.flac,and then leaning forwards in his chair and looking carefully about the corridors of the club he spoke behind his hand and said and the mayor's the biggest grafter of the lot and what's more he added
8969,3982-182255-0044.flac,you want to let the boys know to keep pretty dark and go easy there's a lot of talk i don't like about the elections going round the town let the boys know that just for a while the darker they keep the better whereupon the word was passed
8970,3982-182255-0028.flac,how and where this movement of indignation had started people said that it was part of a new wave of public morality that was sweeping over the entire united states certainly it was being remarked in almost every section of the country
8971,3982-182255-0021.flac,everybody felt it at once people wondered how any sane intelligent community could tolerate the presence of a set of corrupt scoundrels like the twenty aldermen of the city their names it was said
8972,3982-182255-0020.flac,but it is the one that was used look at the alderman they said rotten look at the city solicitor rotten and as for the mayor himself phew the thing came like a wave
8973,3982-182255-0037.flac,when mister newberry said it's worse than russia he meant it every word now just as mister newberry and mister dick overend were finishing their discussion the huge bulky form of mayor mc grath came ponderously past them as they sat
8974,3982-182255-0024.flac,others were butchers two were grocers and all of them wore blue cheqkered waistcoats and red ties and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets nobody had ever really thought about them that is to say nobody on plutoria avenue
8975,3982-182255-0009.flac,when mister newberry and mister dick overend were young men went into congress from pure patriotism there was no such thing as graft or crookedness as they both admitted in those days and as for the united states senate
8976,3982-182255-0015.flac,it thrilled him he would never forget it it stayed in his memory as if it were yesterday but as for the present legislature here mister dick overen sadly nodded assent in advance to what he knew was coming
8977,3982-182255-0027.flac,oh i see i beg your pardon i thought it might be somebody important
8978,3982-182255-0011.flac,and then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey and soda then naturally speaking of the rottenness of the federal government had led them to talk of the rottenness of the state legislature
8979,3982-182255-0041.flac,warm evening is it not the mayor gave no other answer than that deep guttural grunt which is technically known in municipal interviews as refusing to commit oneself did he hear
8980,3982-182255-0012.flac,how different from the state legislatures that they remembered as young men not merely different in the matter of graft but different so mister newberry said in the calibre of the men
8981,3982-182255-0025.flac,sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it one said oh i see an alderman and turned to something else whose funeral is that
8982,3982-182255-0002.flac,absolutely rotten assented mister dick overend ringing the bell for a second whisky and soda corrupt said mister newberry between two puffs of his cigar full of graft said mister overend
8983,3982-182255-0000.flac,chapter eight the great fight for clean government
8984,3982-182255-0005.flac,sinking his voice to a whisper the time has come to speak out about it fearlessly mister overend nodded it's a tyranny he said worse than russia rejoined mister newberry
8985,3982-182255-0003.flac,flicking his ashes into the grate crooked alderman said mister newberry a bum city solicitor said mister overrend and an infernal grafter for a treasurer yes assented mister newberry
8986,3982-182255-0014.flac,than a legislature he said he distinctly recalled a man whose name he didn't recollect speaking on a question he didn't just remember what either for or against
8987,3982-182255-0039.flac,being a politician he merely said good evening gentlemen without a sign of disturbance good evening mister mayor said mister newberry rubbing his hands feebly together and speaking in an
8988,3982-182255-0017.flac,from speaking of the crookedness of the state government mister newberry and mister dick overend were led to talk of the crookedness of the city government and they both agreed as above that things were worse than in russia what secretly irritated them both most
8989,3982-182255-0036.flac,imagine it an irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where thirty eight and a half out of every hundred policemen were irish either by birth or parentage the thing was monstrous so
8990,3982-182255-0043.flac,which was situated in the rear end of a saloon and poolroom far down in the town boys he said to alderman o'hooligan and alderman gorfinkle who were playing friezeout poker in a corner behind the pool tables
8991,3982-182255-0022.flac,were simply a byword throughout the united states for rank criminal corruption this was said so widely that everybody started hunting through the daily papers to try to find out who in blazes were aldermen anyhow
8992,3982-182255-0026.flac,a man would sometimes ask on plutoria avenue oh just one of the city aldermen
8993,3982-182255-0030.flac,they called it the spirit of william penn in the south it was said to be the reassertion of southern chivalry making itself felt against the greed and selfishness of the north while in the north they recognized it at once
8994,3982-182255-0018.flac,was that they had lived and done business under this infernal corruption for thirty or forty years and hadn't noticed it they had been too busy the fact was that their conversation reflected not so much their own original ideas
8995,3982-182255-0029.flac,chicago newspapers were attributing its origin to the new vigor and the fresh ideals of the middle west in boston it was said to be due to a revival of the grand old new england spirit in philadelphia
8996,3982-182255-0034.flac,in a city with a hundred and fifty deaths a week and sometimes even better an undertaker sat on the council a city that was about to expropriate land and to spend four hundred thousand dollars for a new cemetery had an undertaker
8997,3982-182255-0031.flac,as a protest against the sluggishness and ignorance of the south in the west they spoke of it as a revolt against the spirit of the east and in the east they called it a reaction against the lawlessness of the west but everywhere they hailed it as a new sign of the glorious
8998,3982-182255-0006.flac,they had been sitting in a quiet corner of the club it was on a sunday evening
8999,3982-182255-0023.flac,and as a matter of fact at the moment when this wave of feeling struck the city nobody knew or cared who were aldermen anyway to tell the truth the aldermen had been much the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years some were in the produce business
9000,3982-182255-0045.flac,from the thomas jefferson club to the george washington club and thence to the eureka club colored and to the coseuth club hungarian and to various other centres of civic patriotism in the lower parts of the city
9001,3982-182255-0040.flac,ingratiating tone there is no more pitiable spectacle than an honest man caught in the act of speaking boldly and fearlessly of the evil doer good evening mister mayor echoed mister dick overend also rubbing his hands
9002,3982-182255-0019.flac,as a general wave of feeling that was passing over the whole community there had come a moment quite suddenly it seemed when it occurred to everybody at the same time that the whole government of the city was rotten the word is a strong one
9003,3982-182255-0013.flac,he recalled how he had been taken as a boy of twelve by his father to hear a debate he would never forget it giants he said that was what they were in fact the thing was more like a vitengemot
9004,3982-182255-0001.flac,as to the government of this city said mister newberry leaning back in a leather arm chair at the mausoleum club and lighting a second cigar it's rotten that's all
9005,3982-182255-0038.flac,he looked at them sideways out of his eyes he had eyes like plums in a mottled face and being a born politician he knew by the very look of them that they were talking of something that they had no business to be talking about but
9006,3982-182255-0008.flac,the rottenness of the federal government didn't anger them it merely grieved them they could remember both of them how different everything was when they were young men just entering on life
9007,3982-182255-0033.flac,as disinterested as themselves were waking up to the realization of what was going on as soon as people began to look into the condition of things in the city they were horrified at what they found it was discovered for example
9008,3982-182255-0016.flac,as for the present legislature well mister newberry had had he said occasioned to visit the state capital a week before in connection with the railway bill that he was trying to that is that he was anxious to
9009,3982-182255-0042.flac,whispered mister newberry as the mayor passed out of the club i don't care if he did whispered mister dick overend half an hour later mayor mc grath entered the premises of the thomas jefferson club
9010,3982-182255-0010.flac,here their voices were almost hushed in awe why when they were young the united states senate but no neither of them could find a phrase big enough for their meaning they merely repeated
9011,3982-182255-0007.flac,not argumentatively or with any heat but with the reflective sadness that steals over an elderly man when he sits in the leather armchair of a comfortable club smoking a good cigar and musing on the decadence of the present day
9012,3982-178459-0060.flac,won't you he stammered mary i'm going with father isn't there some way you could use the money without without she gave a choked little laugh you gave me something to live for he said you kept me alive i think
9013,3982-178459-0064.flac,and without knowing what she did she set her hands upon his breast pushing him back from her a little i can't i can't don't you see mary no no and you must go now bibbs i can't bear any more please
9014,3982-178459-0023.flac,in love with you no he said somewhere in the still air of the room there was a whispered word it did not seem to come from mary's parted lips but he was aware of it why
9015,3982-178459-0031.flac,and then that i tried to marry you you heard her say that and you believe that i don't care for you and that no girl could care for you but you think that i am in such an extremity as sibyl was
9016,3982-178459-0018.flac,you've given up to your father she said slowly and then you came to ask me she broke off
9017,3982-178459-0038.flac,i knew you'd never thought of me except generously to give i said i couldn't make it plain he cried despairingly wait she lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously like a child
9018,3982-178459-0043.flac,you thought that i was fond of you you knew i cared for you but you didn't think i might be in love with you but you thought that i might marry you without being in love with you
9019,3982-178459-0008.flac,she paused and he came in not lifting his eyes to hers always when he crossed that threshold he had come with his head up and his wistful gaze seeking hers
9020,3982-178459-0015.flac,both of her hands leaped to her cheeks she grew red and then white she rose slowly and moved backwards from him staring at him at first incredulously then with an intense perplexity more and more luminous in her wide eyes
9021,3982-178459-0027.flac,she turned away went to the bare little black mantle and stood leaning upon it presently she asked when did missus rosgo sheridan say that no girl could care about you
9022,3982-178459-0005.flac,she glanced back at bibbs who had turned north he walks kind of slow and stooped over like so much money in his pockets it makes him sag i guess said the young husband with bitter admiration
9023,3982-178459-0050.flac,and i wonder myself why when a family loses its money people always say the daughters ought to go and be stenographers it's curious
9024,3982-178459-0053.flac,i went out to be fascinating and to be married i did it openly at least and with a kind of decent honesty i told your brother i had meant to fascinate him
9025,3982-178459-0026.flac,well not as particularly captivating oddly enough mary's pallor changed to an angry flush those two she exclaimed sharply and then with thoroughgoing contempt lambhorn that's like them
9026,3982-178459-0032.flac,you took your father's offer and then came to ask me to marry you what had i shown you of myself that could make you suddenly she sank down kneeling with her face buried in her arms upon the lap of a chair
9027,3982-178459-0017.flac,bibbs look at me her voice was loud and clear what made you say that look at me he could not look at her and he could not speak what was it that made you she said i want you to tell me
9028,3982-178459-0046.flac,i didn't know you could cry listen she said listen till i get through i want you to understand we were poor and we weren't fitted to be we never had been and we didn't know what to do
9029,3982-178459-0058.flac,i asked his pardon and i said i would not marry him i posted the letter but he never got it that was the afternoon he was killed that's all bibbs now you know what i did and you know
9030,3982-178459-0052.flac,and i didn't know how to be a stenographer i didn't know how to be anything except a well to do old maid or somebody's wife and i couldn't be a well to do old maid then bibbs i did what i'd been raised to know how to do
9031,3982-178459-0047.flac,we'd been almost rich there was plenty but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the town he wanted to be richer but instead well just about the time your father finished building next door
9032,3982-178459-0039.flac,help me up bibbs then when she was once more upon her feet she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him ruefully and faintly but reassuringly as if to tell him in that way
9033,3982-178459-0040.flac,that she knew he had not meant to hurt her and that smile of hers so lamentable but so faithfully friendly misted his own eyes for his shamefacedness lowered them no more
9034,3982-178459-0010.flac,they've made you give up your father's one you're going to do what he wants you've given up
9035,3982-178459-0055.flac,but i think that though i did mean to marry him i never should have done it because that sort of a marriage is it's sacrilege something would have stopped me
9036,3982-178459-0035.flac,you seem to lean down out of a rosy cloud to be kind to me i never dreamed i could do anything for you i never dreamed you could need anything to be done for you by anybody
9037,3982-178459-0007.flac,what's the matter i saw something was terribly wrong when i
9038,3982-178459-0061.flac,and i've hurt you like this
9039,3982-178459-0000.flac,chapter twenty nine as bibbs came out of the new house a sunday trio was in course of passage upon the sidewalk an ample young woman placid of face a black clad
9040,3982-178459-0020.flac,let me think it's something that happened since our walk this morning yes since you left me at noon something happened that she stopped abruptly
9041,3982-178459-0056.flac,she meant no harm but she was horrible and she put what i was doing into such horrible words and they were the truth oh i saw myself she was proposing a miserable compact with me
9042,3982-178459-0054.flac,but i let him think that perhaps i meant to marry him i think i did mean to marry him i had never cared for anybody and i thought it might be there really wasn't anything more than a kind of excited fondness i can't be sure
9043,3982-178459-0036.flac,and to day i heard that that you
9044,3982-178459-0065.flac,mary never never never she cried in a passion of tears you mustn't come any more i can't see you dear never never never somehow in helpless stumbling obedience to her beseeching gesture
9045,3982-178459-0051.flac,no i'd been raised to be either married comfortably or a well to do old maid if i chose not to marry the poverty came on slowly bibbs but at last it was all there
9046,3982-178459-0037.flac,anyone with money she sobbed and you thought we were so so desperate you believe that i had no he said quickly i didn't believe you'd done one kind thing for me for that no no no
9047,3982-178459-0042.flac,you didn't believe that i'd tried to make you fall in love with me never never for an instant you didn't believe i'd tried to make you want to marry me no no no i believe it bibbs
9048,3982-178459-0059.flac,she pressed her clenched hands tightly against her eyes leaning far forward her head bowed before him bibbs had forgotten himself long ago his heart broke for her couldn't you isn't there
9049,3982-178459-0029.flac,answer me once more she said bibbs do you know now why i stopped wearing my furs yes i thought so your sister in law told you didn't she i
9050,3982-178459-0002.flac,sunday fied and made fit to dine with the wife's relatives how'd ye like for me to be that young fella mamma the husband whispered he's one of the sons and there ain't but two left now
9051,3982-178459-0003.flac,the wife stared curiously at bibbs well i don't know she returned he looks to me like he had his own troubles i expect he has like anybody else said the young husband but i guess we could stand a good deal if we had his money
9052,3982-178459-0014.flac,mary he said could you marry me what did you say bibbs she asked quietly his tone and attitude did not change will you marry me
9053,3982-178459-0011.flac,affirmation she gave a little cry of compassion and came and sat near him bibbs she said i can be glad of one thing though it's selfish i can be glad you came straight to me it's more to me than even if you'd come because you are happy
9054,3982-178459-0016.flac,it was like a spoken question the room filled with strangeness in the long silence the two were so strange to each other at last she said what made you say that he did not answer
9055,3982-178459-0013.flac,could you tell me about it do you want to still he did not look up but in a voice shaken and husky he asked her a question so grotesque that at first she thought she had misunderstood his words
9056,3982-178459-0049.flac,you might wonder why i didn't
9057,3982-178459-0006.flac,mary happening to glance from a window saw bibbs coming and she started clasping her hands together in a sudden alarm
9058,3982-178459-0045.flac,i did try to make jim want to marry me i did and she sank down into the chair weeping bitterly again bibbs was agonized mary he groaned
9059,3982-178459-0022.flac,you could she looked at him and slowly shook her head bibbs do you her voice was as unsteady as his little more than a whisper do you think i'm
9060,3982-178459-0025.flac,and when i first came home edith told me sibyl was so anxious to marry that she'd have married me she meant it to express sibyl's extremity you see but i hardly needed either of them to tell me i hadn't thought of myself as
9061,3982-178459-0044.flac,because you did believe i had tried to marry your brother and mary i only knew for the first time that you that you were were desperately poor she said you can't even say that bibbs it was true
9062,3982-178459-0009.flac,ah poor boy she said with a gesture of understanding and pity i know what it is he followed her into the room where they always sat and sank into a chair you needn't tell me she said
9063,3982-178459-0001.flac,thin young man whose expression was one of habitual anxiety habitual wariness and habitual eagerness he propelled a perambulator containing the third
9064,3982-178459-0048.flac,we found we hadn't anything people say that sometimes meaning that they haven't anything in comparison with other people of their own kind but we really hadn't anything we hadn't anything at all bibbs
9065,3982-178459-0063.flac,can't what bibbs you couldn't marry you she said for him yes no no no she sprang up facing him
9066,3982-178459-0057.flac,and i couldn't breathe the air of the same room with her though i'd so cheapened myself that she had a right to assume that i would but i couldn't i left her and i wrote to your brother just a quick scrawl i told him just what i'd done
9067,3982-178459-0024.flac,i've had nothing but dreams bibb said desolately but they weren't like that sibil said no girl could care about me he smiled faintly
9068,3982-178459-0004.flac,well maybe if you keep on the way you been
9069,3982-178459-0041.flac,let me tell you what you want to tell me she said you can't because you can't put it into words they are too humiliating for me and you're too gentle to say them tell me though isn't it true
9070,3982-178459-0066.flac,he got himself to the door
9071,3982-178459-0034.flac,he said i can't make it plain from the first of your loveliness to me i was all self it was always you that gave an i that took i was the dependent i did nothing but lean on you
9072,3982-178459-0030.flac,i heard her say i think i know what happened now mary's breath came fast and her voice shook but she spoke rapidly you heard her say more than that you heard her say that we were bitterly poor and on that account i tried first to marry your brother and then
9073,3982-178459-0012.flac,she did not speak again for a little while then she said
9074,3982-178459-0021.flac,with a tremulous murmur of amazement and dawning comprehension she remembered that sibil had gone to the new house bibbs swallowed painfully and contrived to say i do i do want you to marry me if if
9075,3982-178459-0062.flac,oh a thousand times her right hand went out in a faltering gesture and just touched his own for an instant but there's nothing to forgive and you can't you can't
9076,3982-178459-0033.flac,tears overwhelming her mary mary he cried helplessly oh no you you don't understand i do though she sobbed i do he came and stood beside her you kill me
9077,3982-178459-0019.flac,yes he said just audibly no she cried you do not then what made you ask me what is it that's happened nothing wait she said
9078,3982-178459-0028.flac,to day mary drew a deep breath i think i'm beginning to understand a little she bit her lip there was anger in good truth in her eyes and in her voice
9079,4051-11218-0030.flac,and looked very angry and excessively disturbed for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls
9080,4051-11218-0025.flac,that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled
9081,4051-11218-0017.flac,and instead of running any further toward jason they began to fight among themselves the confusion spread through the host
9082,4051-11218-0041.flac,their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed and with their fierceness the two furnaces in their stomachs had likewise been extinguished
9083,4051-11218-0051.flac,on which he felt inclined to finish his meal in various directions he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees stretching out his neck a terrible long way now here
9084,4051-11218-0046.flac,what is it asked jason have you come so far to seek it
9085,4051-11218-0006.flac,a large tract of black earth ready to be sewn with the dragon's teeth so jason scattered them broadcast and harried them into the soil with a brush harrow and took his stand on the edge of the field anxious to see what would happen next
9086,4051-11218-0049.flac,the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jason's memory soon however something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came
9087,4051-11218-0062.flac,had perpendicularly ready to let fall into the water as jason drew near he heard the talking image calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave sweet voice make haste prince jason for your life make haste
9088,4051-11218-0031.flac,and the dragon's teeth the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon and therefore though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful he was resolved and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentent
9089,4051-11218-0028.flac,the field has been plowed the dragon's teeth have been sewn broadcast and harrowed into the soil
9090,4051-11218-0054.flac,what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden fleece jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward stay foolish youth said medea grasping his arm
9091,4051-11218-0010.flac,tore themselves up by the roots wherever a dragon's tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle they made a clanger with their swords against their shields and eyed one another fiercely
9092,4051-11218-0057.flac,and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down again the dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless it is only a sleeping potion said the enchantress to prince jason
9093,4051-11218-0036.flac,and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset these enchantresses you must know are never to be depended on
9094,4051-11218-0018.flac,hewing and stabbing at one another lopping off arms heads and legs and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration although at the same time he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other
9095,4051-11218-0035.flac,at so many mouthfuls by the dragon but as jason was hastening down the palace steps
9096,4051-11218-0061.flac,although several stone walls a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley
9097,4051-11218-0043.flac,how they had contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapour they breathed the very sweetest of cowbreath after kindly patting the bulls
9098,4051-11218-0052.flac,upon my word as the head came waving and undulating through the air and reaching almost within arm's length of prince jason it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight
9099,4051-11218-0012.flac,and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world like alexander or napoleon to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did
9100,4051-11218-0047.flac,when it glitters before your eyes it is the golden fleece jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze oh how beautiful it looked shining with a marvelous light of its own that it
9101,4051-11218-0022.flac,let them sleep in a bed of honor said the princess medea with a sly smile at jason the world will always have simpletons enough just like them fighting and dying for they know not what and fancying that posterity
9102,4051-11218-0038.flac,and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece whether i slay the dragon or no yes jason said the princess and i can tell you more unless you set sail from colchis
9103,4051-11218-0050.flac,for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws after this feat the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach
9104,4051-11218-0039.flac,stealing through the streets of colchis on their way to the sacred grove
9105,4051-11218-0001.flac,just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwed up tail and held them in a grip like that of an iron vice one with his right hand the other with his left
9106,4051-11218-0008.flac,and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle but by and by all over the field
9107,4051-11218-0019.flac,for an offence which he himself had committed in an incredibly short space of time almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up all but one of the heroes of the dragon's teeth were stretched lifeless on the field
9108,4051-11218-0033.flac,to speak my mind plainly you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks jason left the king's presence in great sorrow and anger he could think of nothing better
9109,4051-11218-0042.flac,than ever before indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass the fire out of their nostrils had shrivelled it up before they could manage to crop it
9110,4051-11218-0021.flac,when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren and there was the end of that army that had sprouted from the dragon's teeth that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth
9111,4051-11218-0002.flac,to be sure but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them and ever since that time
9112,4051-11218-0055.flac,far more effectually than your sword the dragon had probably heard the voices for as swift as lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again darting full forty feet at a stretch as it approached
9113,4051-11218-0007.flac,must we wait long for the harvest time he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side whether sooner or later it will be sure to come answered the princess a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragon's teeth have been sewn
9114,4051-11218-0020.flac,the last survivor the bravest and strongest of the whole who had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and gave a shout of exaltation crying victory victory immortal fame
9115,4051-11218-0011.flac,full of rage and stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense for the boon of their own existence
9116,4051-11218-0058.flac,so i did not wish to kill him outright quick snatch the prize and let us be gone you have won the golden fleece jason caught the fleece from the tree
9117,4051-11218-0023.flac,will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets could you help smiling prince jason to see the self conceit of that last fellow
9118,4051-11218-0026.flac,entering the presence chamber he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obiissance your eyes look heavy prince jason observed the king you appear to have spent a sleepless night
9119,4051-11218-0059.flac,with her peacock beside her she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste disappeared among the duskiness of the trees
9120,4051-11218-0014.flac,and a hundred other outcries such as men always bellow forth on a battle field in which these dragon people seemed to have had their tongues end at last the front rank caught sight of jason who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight
9121,4051-11218-0027.flac,and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazen lunged bulls
9122,4051-11218-0029.flac,and depart with my nine and forty comrades
9123,4051-11218-0034.flac,march at once to the grove of mars slay the dragon take possession of the golden fleece get on board the argo and spread all sail for yolchis the success of this scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point
9124,4051-11218-0009.flac,like sparkling drops of dew these bright objects sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil
9125,4051-11218-0004.flac,it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plow
9126,4051-11218-0060.flac,who were disporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible but lynseus with his sharp eyes had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece
9127,4051-11218-0032.flac,not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece you never would have succeeded in this business young man said he if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments had you acted fairly you would have been at this instante
9128,4051-11218-0024.flac,you will think differently in the morning said medea true the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs have an object you know come your night's work has been well performed
9129,4051-11218-0040.flac,lowing nodding their heads and thrusting forth their snouts which as other cattle do
9130,4051-11218-0044.flac,jason followed medea's guidance into the grove of mars where the great oak trees that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through it
9131,4051-11218-0015.flac,had thought it best to draw his sword in a moment all the sons of the dragon's teeth appeared to take jason for an enemy and crying with one voice guard the golden fleece they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears
9132,4051-11218-0003.flac,when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns and to grip him by the tail is pretty much the same thing that is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it
9133,4051-11218-0013.flac,clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the red hot thirst for battle then they began to shout show us the enemy lead us to the charge death or victory come on brave comrades conquer or die
9134,4051-11218-0037.flac,will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble on the contrary answered jason he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragon's teeth
9135,4051-11218-0053.flac,the gape of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the king's palace well jason whispered medea for she was ill natured as all enchantresses are and wanted to make the bold youth tremble
9136,4051-11218-0000.flac,greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder
9137,4051-11218-0045.flac,medea squeezed jason's hand look yonder she whispered do you see it gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance not like the moonbeams but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun
9138,4051-11218-0005.flac,who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed by the plow at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the green sword and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the plowed field lay before him
9139,4051-11218-0016.flac,the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes when he let fly the stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft
9140,4051-11218-0056.flac,medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monster's wide open throat immediately with an outrageous hiss in a tremendous wriggle flinging his tail up to the tip top of the tallest tree
9141,4051-11218-0048.flac,prize which so many heroes had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the brazen lunged bulls how gloriously it shines cried jason in a rapture
9142,4051-10927-0010.flac,anna is this you said alexey alexandrovitch quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his fingers
9143,4051-10927-0009.flac,i wasn't dull does that offend you alexey alexandrovitch shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack
9144,4051-10927-0014.flac,but judging by the impression made on the company every one observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired i positively don't understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he doesn't care she thought
9145,4051-10927-0005.flac,that she did not care to say a word about herself meant a great deal he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were closed against him more than that he saw from her tone
9146,4051-10927-0011.flac,what do you want of me alexey alexandrovitch paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world
9147,4051-10927-0006.flac,that she was not even perturbed at that but as it were said straight out to him yes it's shut up and so it must be and will be in the future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have returning home and finding his own house locked up
9148,4051-10927-0004.flac,she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind
9149,4051-10927-0001.flac,why what is it what about she asked sitting down well let's talk if it's so necessary but it would be better to get to sleep anna said what came to her lips and marvelled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying
9150,4051-10927-0012.flac,he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them
9151,4051-10927-0024.flac,when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it
9152,4051-10927-0025.flac,but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and had forgotten about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly
9153,4051-10927-0026.flac,she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seemed as it were uppalled at his own snoring and ceased but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again
9154,4051-10927-0003.flac,that any one who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual
9155,4051-10927-0015.flac,but other people noticed it and that's what upsets him you're not well alexey alexandrovitch she added and she got up and would have gone towards the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her his face was ugly and forbidding
9156,4051-10927-0018.flac,to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement
9157,4051-10927-0000.flac,it's late alexey alexandrovitch she said when she had gone through the doorway anna it's necessary for me to have a talk with you with me she said wonderingly she came out from behind the door of the dressing room and looked at him
9158,4051-10927-0020.flac,but believe me what i say i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the word love threw her into revolt again she thought
9159,4051-10927-0016.flac,as anna had never seen him she stopped and bending her head back and on one side began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins well i'm listening to what's to come she said calmly and ironically and indeed i listen with interest
9160,4051-10927-0002.flac,how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy
9161,4051-10927-0013.flac,and i beg you to listen to it i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i observed it
9162,4051-10927-0027.flac,with a new tranquil rhythm it's late it's late she whispered with a smile
9163,4051-10927-0017.flac,began alexey alexandrovitch ferreting in one's soul one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience
9164,4051-10927-0022.flac,that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place
9165,4051-10927-0008.flac,your two animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis attracted attention he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look
9166,4051-10927-0019.flac,i don't understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins anna for god's sake don't speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken
9167,4051-10927-0021.flac,love can he love if he hadn't heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he doesn't even know what love is alexey alexandrovitch really i don't understand she said define what it is you find
9168,4051-10927-0007.flac,but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexey alexandrovitch i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution
9169,4051-10927-0023.flac,in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them
9170,4051-11217-0028.flac,princess he exclaimed you seem indeed very wise and very powerful but how can you help me and do the things of which you speak are you an enchantress yes prince jason answered medea with a smile
9171,4051-11217-0031.flac,which it contained and where to meet her at midnight only be brave added she and before daybreak the brazen bulls shall be tamed the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself
9172,4051-11217-0034.flac,with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky
9173,4051-11217-0029.flac,it is well for you that i am favorably inclined for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason if i only knew how to manage the brazen footed and fiery lunged bulls
9174,4051-11217-0001.flac,and had spent their playdays in the outskirts of the grove in the centre of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree they were now on their way to greece in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been wrongfully taken from their father
9175,4051-11217-0016.flac,what are the conditions which you must fulfil before getting possession of the golden fleece i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful
9176,4051-11217-0025.flac,he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery so that while looking into them
9177,4051-11217-0010.flac,pray are you on a pleasure voyage
9178,4051-11217-0005.flac,at all events turn back who may i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden fleece we will none of us turn back cried his nine and forty brave comrades
9179,4051-11217-0012.flac,for ciron had taught him how to behave with propriety whether to kings or beggars
9180,4051-11217-0013.flac,provided i bring him the golden fleece this as your majesty is aware is now hanging on a tree here at colchis and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away in spite of himself the king's face twisted itself into an angry frown
9181,4051-11217-0011.flac,or what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court great sir replied jason
9182,4051-11217-0035.flac,in the farthest corner of the field it will be excellent sport i assure you when they catch a glimpse of your figure my father and all his court delight in nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order to come at the golden fleece
9183,4051-11217-0026.flac,yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depths or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom if jason had been capable of fearing anything
9184,4051-11217-0004.flac,i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster
9185,4051-11217-0006.flac,much good may it do him an orpheus whose custom it was to set everything to music began to harp and sing most gloriously
9186,4051-11217-0040.flac,one other stride did bold jason make and suddenly as a streak of lightning on came these fiery animals
9187,4051-11217-0009.flac,who dethroned his father you are welcome brave jason
9188,4051-11217-0019.flac,i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly since it stands in the way of my purpose
9189,4051-11217-0018.flac,which vulcan the wonderful blacksmith made for me there is a furnace in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto got nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder
9190,4051-11217-0017.flac,true said the king with a smile that did not look particularly good natured very true young man but there are other things as hard or perhaps a little harder to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon for example
9191,4051-11217-0008.flac,heard of their arrival he instantly summoned jason to the court
9192,4051-11217-0020.flac,from which cadmus raised a crop of armed men they are an unruly set of reprobates those sons of the dragon's teeth and unless you treat them suitably they will fall upon you sword in hand
9193,4051-11217-0002.flac,when the princes understood whither the argonauts were going they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis
9194,4051-11217-0041.flac,as has always been the fashion with angry bulls their breath scorched the herbage before them so intently hot it was indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and sit it all in a light blaze but as for jason himself
9195,4051-11217-0022.flac,make yourself comfortable for to day and to morrow morning since you insist upon it you shall try your skill at the plow while the king talked with jason a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne she fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful stranger
9196,4051-11217-0038.flac,these you will understand were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds at the first two or three steps which jason made
9197,4051-11217-0014.flac,for above all things else in the world he prized the golden fleece and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession
9198,4051-11217-0024.flac,i can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls and sew the dragon's teeth and get the golden fleece indeed beautiful princess answered jason if you will do me this service i promise to be grateful to you my whole life long gazing at medea
9199,4051-11217-0032.flac,and warned them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the king's palace
9200,4051-11217-0036.flac,it makes a holiday in colchis whenever such a thing happens for my part i enjoy it immensely you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder are you sure beautiful medea asked jason
9201,4051-11217-0003.flac,every person who might venture within his reach there are other difficulties in the way continued the young princess
9202,4051-11217-0021.flac,and the four footed pandant his schoolmaster into the bargain why what a foolhearty self conceited coxcomb he is we'll see what my fire breathing bulls will do for him well prince jason he continued aloud and as complaisently as he could
9203,4051-11217-0037.flac,the instant he made a step further
9204,4051-11217-0033.flac,just as they had been pulled out of the monster's jaws by cadmus long ago medea then led jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets of the city and into the royal pasture ground where the two brazen footed bulls were kept it was a starry night
9205,4051-11217-0027.flac,for beautiful as she now looked
9206,4051-11217-0015.flac,had come to colchis with the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure
9207,4051-11217-0007.flac,and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst after this being now under the guidance of the two princes who were well acquainted with the way
9208,4051-11217-0000.flac,why if you will believe me they were the sons of that very phryxus who in his childhood had been carried to colchis on the back of the golden fleeced ram since that time phryxus had married the king's daughter
9209,4051-11217-0039.flac,the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp and were lifting up their hot noses to sniff the air he went a little further
9210,4051-11217-0023.flac,this young woman followed him out of the room i am the king's daughter she said to him and my name is medea i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of if you will trust to me
9211,4051-11217-0030.flac,which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you if you chance to be a little scorched
9212,6454-107462-0019.flac,but those who asked between pensive sips how the facts or the letter had come his way these were the ones who yielded deasey the richest harvest of rattling skeleton bones
9213,6454-107462-0004.flac,for whom the bottles at the presbytery went in by the back door and what was the real cause of the quarrel between the twin miss macinerney's but these were but blackbird scratchings as it were
9214,6454-107462-0028.flac,to the first unvarying words but all that is now past and over and safe beneath the mouldering clay at these last words the widow garehtee knew well the barrier was down
9215,6454-107462-0027.flac,deasey had craved for corpses but nothing so grim as that had risen to his whisky bait until he tried the same old game on missus gerety what subtle instinct was it that had prompted him to add
9216,6454-107462-0005.flac,upon the deep soil of the human heart what deasey cared about was what he called the secrets of the soul never met a man he was wont to say with no backstairs to his mind
9217,6454-107462-0009.flac,but as between friends certain delicate little facts in your past life have come inadvertently to me hearing sometimes he would allude to a certain document or
9218,6454-107462-0037.flac,this touch of the grey feet laid a spell on deasey's hankering morbidity what turned the feet grey he whispered
9219,6454-107462-0032.flac,and the two bright eyes of it and the little clay cold feet deasey knew what was coming now and he twitched in every vein and she so white haired and so regular at church
9220,6454-107462-0011.flac,but always whatever the words whatever the nature or sex the shot would tell first came the little start the straightened figure the pallor or flush
9221,6454-107462-0002.flac,at first when deasey retired from the police force with a pension and an heiress with three hundred pounds and time hung heavy on his hands he would try to satisfy this craving through the medium of a host of small
9222,6454-107462-0026.flac,deasey concluded at once it was a foully murdered corpse but then again you could not well conceal a corpse in some one's waistcoat and gold coins would melt or be mislaid amongst the loose bricks of a sooty chimney
9223,6454-107462-0022.flac,and nomes which had been locked away in darkness maybe this many a year well how would i get the time to claim the childer and to wash their heads and i working all the day at curing stinking hides
9224,6454-107462-0001.flac,for being full of the sour cream of an inhuman curiosity his curiosity however did not extend itself to science
9225,6454-107462-0003.flac,flirtations with everybody's maid in this way he could inform himself exactly how many loaves were taken by the sweeneys for a week's consumption as compared with those which were devoured by all the casites
9226,6454-107462-0017.flac,those who asked after a gentle sip or two how the letter had come into his hands and those who asked immediately if the letter hadn't been destroyed as a rule from the type that demanded the letter back
9227,6454-107462-0008.flac,and setting the whisky bottle betwixt his customer and himself with a nod which said help yourself he would lean forward with the soft indulgent grin of the human man of the world and begin now
9228,6454-107462-0006.flac,to ring at the front door of ordinary intercourse was not enough for him when deasey invested his wife's money in a public house he developed a better plan it was the plan which made him ultimately describe himself
9229,6454-107462-0000.flac,patrick deasey described himself as a philosopher psychologist and humorist it was partly because patrick delighted in long words and partly to excuse himself
9230,6454-107462-0016.flac,under the three heads into which he had divided them those who demanded with violent threats which melted like snow before the sunshine of john jamieson the letter or the name of the informant
9231,6454-107462-0029.flac,that fences off one human soul from another all the same she shook her trembling head when deasey drew the cork at her refusal deasey was struck with the most respectful compassion
9232,6454-107462-0036.flac,let you get up and cut its throat says he and then we will be shet of the damne screeching thing then you got the knife ma'am prompted deasey it was the bread knife she answered with the ugly notches in the blade
9233,6454-107462-0024.flac,there was one of this nature which troubled his rest long well the way of it was you see he put it up the chimbley but when the chimbley sweepers come he transferred it in his waiskit
9234,6454-107462-0007.flac,he would gently close the door of the bar parlour pick up a tumbler breathe on it polish the breath lean one elbow on the bar look round him once again
9235,6454-107462-0018.flac,he only caught sight of the tip of the secret's ears from those they were nearly always the women who swiftly asked if he hadn't destroyed the letters he caught shamefaced gleams of the truth
9236,6454-107462-0020.flac,indeed it was curiously instructive how john jamieson laid down a causeway of gleaming stepping stones so that deasey might cross lightly over the turgid waters of his victim's souls
9237,6454-107462-0013.flac,deasey would make reply but twas from a certain person whom perhaps we need not name then the whisky bottle would move forward like a pawn in chess and the next soothing words would be
9238,6454-107462-0015.flac,and sometimes the whole skeleton would rattle out upon the floor he had played this game so often that almost at first sight he could classify his dupes
9239,6454-107462-0021.flac,has been inadvertently revealed to me but is for ever sacred in me breast it was strange to see how from the underworld of the man's mind there would trip out the company of misshapen hobgoblins
9240,6454-107462-0014.flac,and your secret is safe with me forthwith the little skeleton in that man's cupboard would lean forward and press upon the door until at last the door flew open and a bone or two
9241,6454-107462-0010.flac,incriminating facts or certain letters he would ring the changes on these three according to the sex and temperament with which he had to deal
9242,6454-107462-0012.flac,the shamed and suddenly lit eyes and then who told you mister deasey sir or where did you get the letter ah now that would be telling
9243,6454-107462-0035.flac,maybe it wasn't your fault twas maybe your man egged you on to do the shameful deed
9244,6454-107462-0033.flac,and the black bonnet on the head of her and all it was the only little one she had went on the widow bowed almost to the bar by shame and it always perched up on her knee and taking food from her mouth
9245,6454-107462-0031.flac,no ma'am returned deasey to look at you ye'd think ma'am yo could never kill a fly and respectfully he passed the peppermints sometimes the widow muttered i hear's it
9246,6454-107462-0030.flac,until that hour he had never known one single lacerated soul decline this consolation and to look at me she wept forthwith
9247,6454-107462-0025.flac,to my place and i dropped it down the well they found it when they let the bucket down but i wasn't his accomplice at all twas only connivance with me when he had spoken of the chimney and the well
9248,6454-107462-0023.flac,and he fell over on the side and busted all his veins or well an wouldn't you draw two pinsions yourself mister deasey if you'd a wife with two hands like a sieve for yellow gold
9249,6454-107462-0034.flac,but i had bad teeth in me head and i couldn't get me rest with the jaws aching and all the whiles it screeching with a group twould madden you all the same deasey whispered
9250,6454-120342-0005.flac,and so tuesday night the metropolitan people gave up their unequal contest all good men and angels rejoicing at their discomfiture and only a few of the people in the very lowest bolgi being ill natured enough to grieve
9251,6454-120342-0028.flac,large enough to contain all the good wishes so away again to the houses of confectioners who had given the children candy
9252,6454-120342-0033.flac,everywhere a little crowd gathered round us and then we dashed away far enough to gather quite another crowd and then back perhaps not sorry to double on our steps if need were and leaving every crowd with a happy thought of
9253,6454-120342-0003.flac,howland is always good about such things knew what the sleigh was for having done the same in other years and doubled the span of horses of his own accord because the children would like it better and it would be no difference to him
9254,6454-120342-0013.flac,shepherd of tender sheep singing with all that unconscious pathos with which children do sing and starting the tears in your eyes in the midst of your gladness the instant the horses bell stopped their voices began
9255,6454-120342-0015.flac,little did clement think of bells and snow as he taught it in his sunday school there in alexandria but perhaps to day as they pin up the laurels and the palm in the chapel at alexandria
9256,6454-120342-0035.flac,begged that they might stay till the last moment they could walk back from the stable and rather walk than not indeed
9257,6454-120342-0024.flac,though chrysostom should have made a few remarks to them seventeen times in the chapel then the italian image man heard for the first time in his life now is the time of christmas come and
9258,6454-120342-0006.flac,and without fatigue to horse or man so it was that when i came down with licadath to the chapel at seven o'clock i found harry had gathered there his eight pretty girls and his eight jolly boys
9259,6454-120342-0012.flac,so we dashed up to the front of haliburton's palace where he was keeping his first christmas tide and the children whom harry had hushed down for a square or two broke forth with good full voice under his strong lead in
9260,6454-120342-0017.flac,haliburton came running out and begged me to bring them in but i told him no as soon as i could hush their shouts of merry christmas that we had a long journey before us and must not alight by the way
9261,6454-120342-0019.flac,we ran the sleigh into a bank on the slope of pinkney street in front of walter's house and before they suspected there that anyone had come the children were singing carol carol christians carol joyfully
9262,6454-120342-0008.flac,or perhaps harry had hinted it to their mothers certainly they were warmly dressed and when fifteen minutes afterwards howland came round himself with the sleigh he had put in as many rugs and bear skins
9263,6454-120342-0011.flac,there can be nothing better than two or three such hours first driver out on commonwealth avenue that will tone down the horses stop on the left after you have passed fairfield street
9264,6454-120342-0021.flac,and all of them fell in so cheerily oh dear me it is a scrap of old ephram the syrian if they did but know it and when after this harry would fain have driven on
9265,6454-120342-0010.flac,under the full moon on the snow still white with sixteen children at the happiest
9266,6454-120342-0034.flac,the star the manger and the child at nine we brought up at my house d street three doors from the corner and the children picked their very best for polly and my six little girls to hear
9267,6454-120342-0025.flac,jesus and his babes abiding and then we came up hanover street and stopped under mister jerry's chapel where they were dressing the walls with their evergreens and gave them hail to the night hail to the day
9268,6454-120342-0018.flac,and the children broke out with hail to the night hail to the day rather a favourite quicker and more to the childish taste perhaps than the other and with another merry christmas we were off again
9269,6454-120342-0002.flac,should break up the spree before it began then i had told howland that he must reserve for me a span of good horses and a sleigh that i could pack sixteen small children into tight stowed
9270,6454-120342-0000.flac,ours are not the carollings of your poor shivering little east angles or south mercians where they have to plod round a foot in countries where they do not know what a sleigh ride is
9271,6454-120342-0001.flac,i had asked harry to have sixteen of the best voices in the chapel school to be trained to eight or ten good carols without knowing why we did not care to disappoint them if a february thaw setting in on the twenty fourth of december
9272,6454-120342-0023.flac,and then up the hill and over to the north end and as far as we could get the horses up into moon court that they might sing to the italian image man who gave lucy the boy and dog in plaster
9273,6454-120342-0026.flac,and so down state street and stopped at the advertiser office because when the boys gave their literary entertainment mister hale put in their advertisement for nothing and up in the old attic there
9274,6454-120342-0007.flac,and had them practising for the last time carol carol christians carol joyfully carol for the coming of christnativity i think the children had got inkling of what was coming
9275,6454-120342-0030.flac,and out on dover street bridge that the poor chair mender might hear our caroll sung once more before he heard them better sung in another world where nothing needs mending
9276,6454-120342-0004.flac,sunday night as the weather nymphs ordered the wind hauled round to the northwest and everything froze hard monday night things moderated and the snow began to fall steadily so steadily
9277,6454-120342-0020.flac,kisses flung from the window kisses flung back from the street merry christmas again with a good will and then one of the girls began when anna took the baby and pressed his lips to hers
9278,6454-120342-0031.flac,king of glory king of peace hear the song and see the star welcome be thou heavenly king
9279,6454-120342-0027.flac,and the in general man from his more serious views and the daily the next morning wished everybody a merry christmas with even more unction and resolved that in coming years it would have a supplement
9280,6454-120342-0022.flac,because two carols at one house was the rule how the little witches begged that they might sing just one song more there because missus alexander had been so kind to them when she showed them about the german stitches
9281,6454-120342-0032.flac,and all the others rung out with order or without order breaking the hush directly as the horses bells were stilled thrown into the air with all the gladness of childhood
9282,6454-120342-0016.flac,they are humming the words not thinking of clement more than he thought of us as the children closed with
9283,6454-120342-0009.flac,as if he thought the children were to be taken new born from their respective cradles great was the rejoicing as the bells of the horses rang beneath the chapel windows and harry did not get his last dacapo for his last carol
9284,6454-120342-0029.flac,to the palaces of millionaires who had prayed for these children with tears if the children only knew it to doctor frathingham's in summer street i remember where we stopped because the boston association of ministers met there
9285,6454-120342-0014.flac,in an instant more we saw haliburton and anna run to the window and pull up the shades and in a minute more faces at all the windows and so the children sung through clement's old hymn
9286,6454-93938-0011.flac,and when i saw the judge finish off his signature with a flourish i played a pretty desperate card you're just too late gentlemen i said pointing out the side window of the saloon there come the cavalry
9287,6454-93938-0030.flac,i was now heading for the station over the ties and was surprised to see fred cullen with lord rales on the tracks up by the special for my mind had been so busy in the last hour
9288,6454-93938-0017.flac,and considering that he had covered over forty miles that afternoon in pretty quick time it was not surprising that there wasn't very much go left in him
9289,6454-93938-0019.flac,but i lost sight of them the next moment as soon as i reached a street leading back to the railroad i turned again and rode towards it my one thought being to get back if possible to the station
9290,6454-93938-0024.flac,that not one of them drew a bead on me the moment i saw that there was no escape i put my hand in my breast pocket and took out the letters intending to tear them into a hundred pieces but
9291,6454-93938-0002.flac,to make matters more serious baldwin had rounded up his cowboys and brought them along with him in order to make any resistance impossible i made no objection to the sheriff serving the paper
9292,6454-93938-0007.flac,on the night of october fourteenth and ask that he be taken into custody on that charge i couldn't make out this new move and puzzled over it while judge wilson ordered my commitment
9293,6454-93938-0034.flac,intending to ride up and run into my car for i knew that the papers in my hand would be taken to be the wanted letters and that if i could only get inside the car even for a moment the suspicion would be that i had been able to hide them
9294,6454-93938-0033.flac,afraid to shout anything which should convey the slightest clue as to the whereabouts of the letters as the next best thing i pulled a couple of old section reports from my pocket
9295,6454-93938-0022.flac,in expectation of hearing the shooting begin and to know that any moment may be your last i don't suppose i was on the ragged edge more than thirty seconds but they were enough to prove to me that
9296,6454-93938-0023.flac,to keep one's back turned to an enemy as one runs away takes a deal more pluck than to stand up and face his gun fortunately for me my pursuers felt so sure of my capture
9297,6454-93938-0020.flac,and put the letters into the railroad agent safe when i reached the main street i saw that my hope was futile for another batch of cowboys were coming in full gallop towards me very thoroughly heading me off in that direction
9298,6454-93938-0015.flac,as only western horses will stand it didn't take me long to have those bridles back in place and as i tossed each over the peak of the mexican saddle
9299,6454-93938-0001.flac,seeing through the device the party had at once gone to this ranch where the owner baldwin mounted them and it was their dust cloud we had seen as they rode up to ash forks
9300,6454-93938-0009.flac,this made me feel pretty serious for the letters were in my breast pocket and i swore at my own stupidity in not having put them in the station safe when i had first arrived at ash fork's
9301,6454-93938-0008.flac,but the next step revealed the object for the lawyer then asked for a search warrant to look for stolen property the judge was equally obliging and began to fill one out on the instant
9302,6454-93938-0021.flac,to escape them i headed up the street away from the station with the pack in close pursuit they yelled at me to hold up and i expected every moment to hear the crack of revolvers
9303,6454-93938-0016.flac,i gave two of the ponies slaps which started them off at a lope across the railroad tracks i swung myself into the saddle of the third and flicked him with the loose ends of the bridle in a way which made him understand that i meant business
9304,6454-93938-0000.flac,what seemed at the moment an incomprehensible puzzle had as we afterwards learned a very simple explanation one of the g s directors mister baldwin who had come in on mister camp's carr
9305,6454-93938-0018.flac,two hundred feet therefore brought me to the edge of the town and i wheeled my pony and rode down behind the rear of the buildings in turning i looked back and saw half a dozen mounted men already in pursuit
9306,6454-93938-0014.flac,i grabbed the key and locked them in when i turned to do so i saw the lot struggling up from the floor and knowing that it wouldn't take them many seconds to find their way out through the window
9307,6454-93938-0003.flac,and the stars in their courses are against cicera with the sheriff and mister camp i then walked over to the saloon where judge wilson was waiting to dispose of my case
9308,6454-93938-0010.flac,there weren't many moments in which to think while the judge scribbled away at the warrant but in what time there was i did a lot of headwork without however finding more than one way out of the snarl
9309,6454-93938-0032.flac,but before i was within speaking distance baldwin came running out from behind the station and seeing me turned called back and gesticulated evidently to summon some cowboys to head me off
9310,6454-93938-0028.flac,this put me out of view of my pursuers for a moment and in that instant i stood up in my stirrups lifted the broad leather flap of the saddle and tucked the letters underneath it as far in as i could force them
9311,6454-93938-0005.flac,i told wilson i should not produce the letters and he asked if i knew what that meant i couldn't help laughing and retorting it very appropriately means contempt of the court your honor
9312,6454-93938-0025.flac,as i did so i realized that to destroy united states mail not merely entailed criminal liability but was off color morally i faltered
9313,6454-93938-0006.flac,seeing that i understood the moves too well to be bluffed the judge mister camp and the lawyer held a whispered consultation my surprise can be imagined when at its conclusion mister camp said
9314,6454-93938-0004.flac,and answered that i asked an adjournment of the case so that i might be heard by counsil it was denied as was to have been expected indeed why they took the trouble to go through the forms was beyond me
9315,6454-93938-0029.flac,it was a desperate place in which to hide them but the game was a desperate one at best and the very boldness of the idea might be its best chance of success
9316,6454-93938-0027.flac,till i thought that madge wouldn't want me to be dishonest even for her i turned across the railroad tracks and cut in behind some freight cars that were standing on a siding
9317,6454-93938-0035.flac,hide them fred was quick as a flash and grabbing them off the ground sprang up the steps of my car and ran inside just escaping a bullet from my pursuers
9318,6454-93938-0013.flac,as he did so i gave him a shove towards the three which sent them all sprawling on the floor in a pretty badly mixed up condition i made a dash for the door and as i went through it
9319,6454-93938-0026.flac,balancing the outwitting of camp against state's prison the doing my best for madge against the wrong of it i think i'm as honest a fellow as the average but i have to confess that i couldn't decide to do right
9320,6454-93938-0012.flac,the three conspirators jumped to their feet and bolted for the window
9321,6454-93938-0031.flac,that i had forgotten that fred was due the moment i saw him i rode towards him pressing my pony for all he was worth my hope was that i might get time to give fred the tip as to where the letters were
9322,5339-14133-0035.flac,as a favourable symptom or otherwise by and by luckily for him an some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table she caught the edge of her work basket and down it fell she stooped to pick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted
9323,5339-14133-0041.flac,and then they sat down on the settle together and when she was more composed they began to talk he asked her about her mother not sorry in his heart at bell robson's absence
9324,5339-14133-0032.flac,she did not come forward to meet him she went crimson to the very roots of her hair but that in the waning light he could not see and she shook so that she felt as if she could hardly stand but the tremor was not visible to him
9325,5339-14133-0052.flac,he wound up with a chuckle as the thought struck him that this great piece of business of disposing of their only child had been concluded while his wife was away
9326,5339-14133-0018.flac,there was much to be done in foster's shop and later hours were kept than usual some perplexity or other was occupying john and jeremiah foster
9327,5339-14133-0056.flac,for a time there was no answer then a door was unbolted and sylvia said i can't come down again
9328,5339-14133-0002.flac,or washing or churning days her life was quiet and monotonous although hard working and while her hands mechanically found and did their accustomed labor the thoughts that rose in her head always centered on charliey kinraid his ways his words
9329,5339-14133-0010.flac,of which she otherwise occupied was quite unaware she liked him better too than she had done a year or two before because he did not show her any of the eager attention which teased her then although its meaning was not fully understood
9330,5339-14133-0005.flac,and to see sylvia for the two fosters were punctuously anxious to make their shopmen test all their statements insisting on an examination of the stock as if hepburn and coulson were strangers to the shop
9331,5339-14133-0022.flac,i wish iad seen him said coulson
9332,5339-14133-0004.flac,he was very busy with facts and figures
9333,5339-14133-0051.flac,robson listened to all he said with approving nods and winks till charley had told him everything he had to say and then he turned and struck his broad horny palm into kinraid's as if concluding a bargain
9334,5339-14133-0024.flac,and then my master saw another girl that he liked better william almost choked in his endeavour to keep down all appearance of violent anger and then went on and that he played the same game with as i'v heard tell and how did thy sister take it
9335,5339-14133-0019.flac,but it thus happened that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render at such times and coulson had been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and philip as future partners
9336,5339-14133-0017.flac,it was the time of the great half yearly traffic of the place another impetus was given to business when the whalers returned in the autumn and the men were flush of money and full of delight at once more seeing their homes and their friends
9337,5339-14133-0011.flac,things were much in this state when the frost broke and milder weather succeeded this was the time so long looked forward to by the invalid an her friends as favouring the doctor's recommendation of change of air her husband was to take her
9338,5339-14133-0037.flac,yo might ha forgotten me and yet i thought we made a bargain against forgetting each other no answer he went on you've never been out o my thoughts sylvia robson
9339,5339-14133-0015.flac,conscious of the demand in which they were held at this season of the year it was war time too many captains unable to procure men in monkshaven would have to complete their crews in the shetlands the shops in the town were equally busy
9340,5339-14133-0050.flac,at any rate it was not unwelcome he liked kinraid and had strong sympathy not merely with what he knew of the young sailor's character but with the life he led and the business he followed
9341,5339-14133-0030.flac,it was red up for the afternoon covered with a black mass of coal over which the equally black kettle hung on the crook in the back kitchen dolly read sylvia's assistant during her mother's absence chanted a lugubrious ditty befitting her condition as a widow
9342,5339-14133-0028.flac,sylvia sat in the house place her back to the long low window in order to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her work a basket of her father's unmended stockings was on the little round table beside her
9343,5339-14133-0045.flac,i shall go to sea happy now thinking i've yer word you're not one to go back from it i'm sure else it's a long time to leave such a pretty girl as yo and ne'er a chance of a letter reaching yo just to tell yo once again how i love yo
9344,5339-14133-0026.flac,this fault of his was one with which the two grave sedate young men had no sympathy their hearts were true and constant whatever else might be their failings and it is no new thing to damn the faults we have no mind to
9345,5339-14133-0036.flac,and so did he and when they rose up he had fast hold of her hand and her face was turned away half ready to cry
9346,5339-14133-0001.flac,and bell robson though not getting worse did not make any progress towards amendment
9347,5339-14133-0008.flac,perhaps more silent than she had been a year ago and she did not attend so briskly to what was passing around her she was rather thinner and paler but whatever change there was in her was always an improvement in philip's eyes
9348,5339-14133-0043.flac,had given him the chance of seeing her alone and obtaining her promise to marry him without being obliged to tell either her father or her mother at present i had spent my money pretty free he said and i've ne'er a pinny to the for
9349,5339-14133-0044.flac,and your parents may look for something better for yo my pretty
9350,5339-14133-0020.flac,one evening after the shop was closed while they were examining the goods and comparing the sales with the entries in the day book coulson suddenly inquired by the way hester does the know where the parcel of the best bandannas as gone there was four left as i'm pretty sure when i set off to sansond
9351,5339-14133-0049.flac,but she weary of a subject she cared nothing about and eager to identify herself with all his interests asked him about his plans almost at the same time that he said these last words and they went on as lovers do
9352,5339-14133-0012.flac,to spend a fortnight with a kindly neighbor who lived near the farm they had occupied forty miles or so inland before they came to haytersbank the widow woman was to come and stay in the house to keep sylvia company during her mother's absence
9353,5339-14133-0023.flac,why what's up said philip surprised at william's unusual manner and at the same time rather gratified to find a reflection of his own feelings about kinraid coulson's face was pale with anger
9354,5339-14133-0025.flac,she died in a six month said william she forgived him but it's beyond me i thought it were him that i heard of to work about darley kinraid and coming from newcastle where annie lived prentice and i made inquiry
9355,5339-14133-0007.flac,but this it was evident would not have satisfied their masters who were scrupulous in insisting that whatever advantage there was should always fall on the side of the younger men when philip saw sylvia she was always quiet and gentle
9356,5339-14133-0003.flac,like nancy and borrowing the poor girl's own words she would say softly to herself he once was here but all along she believed in her heart he would come back again to her though it touched her strangely to imagine the agonies of forsaken love
9357,5339-14133-0000.flac,black and bitter but welcome enough to the farmers
9358,5339-14133-0006.flac,by degrees both hepburn and coulson were introduced to distinct manufacturers and wholesale dealers
9359,5339-14133-0055.flac,an old man like me isn't as good a company as a pretty lass laughing a low rich laugh over his own wit daniel went to the bottom of the stairs and called sylvie
9360,5339-14133-0040.flac,he had not taken two steps when she turned quickly towards him and said something
9361,5339-14133-0013.flac,daniel indeed was to return home after conveying his wife to her destination but there was so much to be done on the land at this time of the year that sylvia would have been alone all day had it not been for the arrangement just mentioned
9362,5339-14133-0021.flac,is he here again said philip i didn't see him what brings him here
9363,5339-14133-0033.flac,the tones the looks that ad accompanied those words but all she said was i didn't think to see you
9364,5339-14133-0038.flac,and i've been near neither kith nor kin as yet and now i'm here yo won't speak to me i don't know what to say
9365,5339-14133-0031.flac,charley kinraid and the story of crazy nancy had been the subjects for her dreams for many a day and many a night now he stood there bright and handsome as ever with just that much timidity in his face that anxiety as to his welcome
9366,5339-14133-0047.flac,and there's yon tall fellow of a cousin as looks black at me
9367,5339-14133-0042.flac,he had intended if necessary to acknowledge his wishes and desires with regard to sylvia to her parents but for various reasons he was not sorry that circumstances
9368,5339-14133-0014.flac,and yet these must be reached before june or the year's expedition would be of little avail every blacksmith's shop rung with the rhythmical clang of busy hammers beating out old iron such as horseshoes nails or stubs into the great harpoons
9369,5339-14133-0029.flac,and one was on her left hand which she supposed herself to be mending but from time to time she made long pauses and looked in the fire and yet there was but little motion of flame or light in it out of which to conjure visions
9370,5339-14133-0053.flac,mischief only knows but she's noin keen on matrimony
9371,5339-14133-0054.flac,we'n best keep this matter to ourselves till thou comes into port again
9372,5339-14133-0046.flac,there'll be no need o that murmured sylvia she was too dizzy with happiness to have attended much to his details of his worldly prospects but at the sound of his tender words of love her eager heart was ready to listen i don't know
9373,5339-14133-0009.flac,so long as she spoke graciously to him he thought she was suffering from long continued anxiety about her mother or that she had too much to do and either cause was enough to make him treat her with a grave regard and deference which had a repressed tenderness in it
9374,5339-14133-0016.flac,stores had to be purchased by the waling masters warm clothing of all sorts to be provided these were the larger wholesale orders but many a man and woman too brought out their small hoards to purchase extra comforts or precious keepsakes for some beloved one
9375,5339-14133-0039.flac,till i taught her to love me more but if she's a cold heart and cannot care for an honest sellor why then i'd best go back at once he made for the door he must have been pretty sure from some sign or other or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to give way
9376,5339-14133-0034.flac,she felt his eyes were upon her watching every motion and grew more and more confused in her expression and behaviour he was a little taken aback by the nature of his reception and was not sure at first whether to take the great change in her manner
9377,5339-14133-0027.flac,he had only come that afternoon to monkshaven and for the sole purpose of seeing sylvia once more before he went to fulfil his engagement at specsiner in the urania a whaling vessel that was to sail from north shields on thursday morning and this was monday
9378,5339-14133-0048.flac,he's a notion of being sweet on yo hisself not he said sylvia with some contempt in her tone
9379,5339-14134-0025.flac,said coulson luck said alice turning sharp round on him niver let me hear such a vain word out o thy mouth laddie again it's the lord's doin and the luck's the devil's way o puttin it
9380,5339-14134-0027.flac,but if that's the frame o mine thouart in london is liked for to be a sore place o temptation there's pitfalks for men an traps for money in every turn as i've heard say
9381,5339-14134-0077.flac,the need for his departure and yet he stood still for a little time like one entranced as if his will had lost all power to compel him to leave the place those two words of hers which two hours before would have been so far beneath his aspirations
9382,5339-14134-0042.flac,he told his uncle that he was bound for london the next day on business connected with the fosters daniel was deeply struck with the fact that he was talking to a man setting off for london at a day's notice
9383,5339-14134-0033.flac,what's to do hester said he she lifted up those eyes usually so soft and serene now they were full of the light of indignation shining through tears to do she said coulson i'd thought better of thee
9384,5339-14134-0024.flac,to lunnon exclaimed alice hester said nothing
9385,5339-14134-0026.flac,niver fret thyself mother about to shirt said philip if i need a shirt
9386,5339-14134-0079.flac,and i'll be home again as soon as iver i can in half a year such as he forgets if ever he's thought serious about her but in a my lifetime if i lived forscore i can niver forgit
9387,5339-14134-0008.flac,but to whom they had latterly advanced money the letters hinted at the utter insolvency of this manufacturer they had urged their correspondent to give them his name and confidence and this morning's letter had brought it
9388,5339-14134-0049.flac,geirin inda an folkas talkin on a new kind oll make an if thou's bound for york i'm not going by york i'm going by a newcastle smack newcastle
9389,5339-14134-0056.flac,as disturbing her in the one blessed subject of thought in which alone she cared to indulge well philip and what brings you here was her rather ungracious greeting why sylvie are yo sorry to see me
9390,5339-14134-0010.flac,and was publicly distinguished for his excellent and philanthropic character but these letters were provocative of anxiety especially since this morning's post had brought out the writer's full name and various particulars showing his intimate knowledge of dickinson's affairs
9391,5339-14134-0051.flac,i'll reckon to hear from thee in a week or mayhap less
9392,5339-14134-0072.flac,dark the wood fire not gathered together by careful hands died out into gray ashes dolly reed had done her work and gone home there were but philip and sylvia in the house
9393,5339-14134-0041.flac,and convinced of her great love towards himself had forgotten any previous jealousy of philip secure and exultant his broad handsome weather bronzed face was as great a contrast to philip's long thoughtful sallow countenance
9394,5339-14134-0036.flac,and yet he was reproached for the course it was taken
9395,5339-14134-0059.flac,that she whom he loved had asked him to do something for her and he had neglected it so anxious to be excused and forgiven he went on with the apology she cared not to hear if she had been less occupied with her own affairs less engrossed with deep feeling
9396,5339-14134-0044.flac,no i shan't he replied shortly liking has naught to do with it ay ye knew naught about it last neet continued daniel musingly
9397,5339-14134-0048.flac,so they parted but philip had not gone many steps before his uncle called him back kinraid slowly loitering on meanwhile
9398,5339-14134-0031.flac,i'll not deny but at other times i'm pleased at the thought on it but if i could i'd change places with thee at this moment it's fan talking said coulson half mullified and yet not caring to show it i make no doubt it were an even chance betwixt us too at first
9399,5339-14134-0070.flac,and to warn yo if need were my mother never bid yo to come spyin after me an blamin me for seein a lad as my feather thinks well on
9400,5339-14134-0032.flac,she was playing with her teaspoon but he could see that she was choking down her tears
9401,5339-14134-0060.flac,she would have reproached him if only in jest for his carelessness as it was she scarcely took in the sense of his words
9402,5339-14134-0071.flac,sylvie sylvie
9403,5339-14134-0061.flac,he paused a little sylvia's galloping thoughts were pulled suddenly up by his silence she felt that he wanted her to say something but she could think of nothing besides an ambiguous well
9404,5339-14134-0075.flac,i shall be a long time away perhaps i may never come back at all here he bitterly thought of an unregarded death say good bye no answer he waited patiently can she be wearied out and gone to sleep he wondered yet once again
9405,5339-14134-0018.flac,saying it was more than he should require but they repeated with fresh urgency their warnings about the terrible high prices of london till he could only resolve to keep a strict account and bring back all that he did not expend since nothing but his taking the whole sum would satisfy his employers
9406,5339-14134-0046.flac,though our ship lay a fortneat of gravesond kinraid now seemed in a hurry but philip was stung with curiosity to ascertain his movements and suddenly addressed him i heard yo were in these parts
9407,5339-14134-0043.flac,nay said philip i knew nought about it last night it's none o my doing going for i'd leefer has stayed where i am yo'll like it when once yo're there
9408,5339-14134-0023.flac,as they all sat at tea in alice rose's house place philip announced his intended journey
9409,5339-14134-0009.flac,but the name was totally unknown to them though there seemed no reason to doubt the reality of either it or the address the latter of which was given in full
9410,5339-14134-0028.flac,said coulson he sent for
9411,5339-14134-0047.flac,and sail for the north seas day after he turned away and began to whistle as if he did not wish for any further conversation with his interrogator philip indeed had nothing more to say to him he had learned all he wanted to know i like to bid good bye to sylvia is she at home he asked of her father
9412,5339-14134-0020.flac,that great city of london which from its very inaccessibility fifty years ago loomed so magnificent through the mist of men's imaginations it is not to be denied that philip felt exultant at the mere fact of going to london but then again the thought of leaving sylvia
9413,5339-14134-0074.flac,sylvie i'm going away say good by no answer not a sound heard sylvie a little louder and less hoarsely spoken there was no reply sylvie
9414,5339-14134-0029.flac,philip knows said hester and then somehow her voice failed her and she stopped philip paid no attention to this half uttered sentence he was eager to tell coulson as far as he could do so without betraying his master's secret how many drawbacks there were to his proposed journey
9415,5339-14134-0034.flac,going and doubting and envying philip as never did thee in ill turn or said an ill word or thought an ill thought by thee and sending him away out on ter house this last night of all
9416,5339-14134-0017.flac,while he appeared to listen to all that was said with quiet business like attention it was settled that the next morning he was to make his way northwards to harderpool whence he could easily proceed either by land or sea to newcastle from which place smacks were constantly sailing to london
9417,5339-14134-0013.flac,and he had only been brought partially to consent to the sending of hepburne by his brother's pledging himself that the real nature of philip's errand should be unknown to any human creature save them three as all this was being revealed to philip he sat apparently unmoved and simply attentive
9418,5339-14134-0039.flac,he would pour out his love at her feet not even urging the young girl to make any return or to express the feelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her he would be patient with her he could not be patient himself
9419,5339-14134-0045.flac,before going to see said philip half smiling na
9420,5339-14134-0038.flac,and all the modification on this point which his judgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart was that he would watch her words and manner well when he announced his approaching absence and if in them he read the slightest token of tender regretful feeling
9421,5339-14134-0078.flac,and touched her pride maybe too
9422,5339-14134-0069.flac,it were yor own mother sylvia as knowed yo had no brother or any one to see after yo and yo're so pretty so pretty sylvia he continued shaking his head sadly that men run after ye against their will as one may say
9423,5339-14134-0004.flac,and were perhaps as full of consideration as to the possible contents of this london letter
9424,5339-14134-0012.flac,even now jeremiah was ashamed of their want of confidence in one so good he believed that the information they had received would all prove a mistake founded on erroneous grounds if not a pure invention of an enemy
9425,5339-14134-0053.flac,and she had covertly watched them up the brow in the field she sat down to meditate and dream about her great happiness in being beloved by her hero charley kinraid no gloomy dread of his long summer's absence no fear of the cold
9426,5339-14134-0055.flac,her lips still warm and reddened by his kiss were just parted in a happy smile when she was startled by the sound of an approaching footstep a footstep quite familiar enough for her to recognize it and which was unwelcome now
9427,5339-14134-0003.flac,with her basket of letters one of these seemed of especial consequence to the good brothers they each separately looked at the direction and then at one another and without a word they returned with it unread into the parlour shutting the door and drawing the green silk curtain close the better to read it in privacy
9428,5339-14134-0050.flac,can give all requisite information ay ay said robson
9429,5339-14134-0000.flac,of the number of letters that arrived in monkshaven the fosters shopkeepers and bankers had the largest share the morning succeeding the day on which sylvia had engaged herself to kinraid the foster seemed unusually anxious to obtain their letters
9430,5339-14134-0002.flac,and who must have been lamer than ever this morning to judge from the lateness of her coming although none but the fosters knew the cause of their impatience for their letters yet there was such tacit sympathy between them and those whom they employed
9431,5339-14134-0006.flac,it was apparently by john foster's wish that philip had been summoned jeremiah the less energetic and decided brother was still discussing the propriety of the step when philip entered
9432,5339-14134-0016.flac,philip had the satisfaction of feeling himself employed on a mission which would call out his powers and yet not exceed them in his own mind he forestalled the instructions of his masters and was silently in advance of john foster's plans and arrangements
9433,5339-14134-0065.flac,she stooped for something she had dropped and came up red as a rose to be sure what then and she eyed him defiantly though in her heart she trembled she knew not why what then
9434,5339-14134-0015.flac,john perceived that his messenger would exercise penetration and act with energy while jeremiah was soothed by philip's caution in not hastily admitting the probability of any charge against dickinson and in giving full weight to his previous good conduct and good character
9435,5339-14134-0007.flac,that the fosters had for some time received anonymous letters warning them with distinct meaning though in ambiguous terms against a certain silk manufacturer in spitalfields with whom they had had straightforward business dealings for many years
9436,5339-14134-0067.flac,itwere willie coulson as telled me as solemn and serious as one man can speak to another
9437,5339-14134-0063.flac,nothing more as philip's instinct told him but he reasoned that first correct impression away with ingenious sophistry not to live there only to stay for some time
9438,5339-14134-0021.flac,of not seeing her for a week a fortnight nay he might be away for a month for no rash hurry was to mar his delicate negotiation gnawled at his heart
9439,5339-14134-0014.flac,in fact he was giving all his mind to understanding the probabilities of the case leaving his own feelings in the background till his intellect should have done its work he said little but what he did say was to the point and satisfied both brothers
9440,5339-14134-0001.flac,several times jeremiah came out of the parlor in which his brother john was sitting in expectant silence and passing through the shop looked up and down the market place in search of the old lame woman who was charitably employed to deliver letters
9441,5339-14134-0037.flac,and til he had patiently with long continuing and deep affection worked his way into her regard was set aside during the present walk he would speak to her of his passionate attachment before he left for an uncertain length of time and the certain distance of london
9442,5339-14134-0062.flac,almost as if beseeching her to show or express some sorrow at a journey the very destination of which showed that he would be absent for some time to lunnon
9443,5339-14134-0022.flac,several times that day as he perceived coulson's jealous sullenness
9444,5339-14134-0076.flac,and god bless yo i'm sorry i vexed yo no reply with a heavy heavy heart he creaked down the stairs felt for his cap and left the house
9445,5339-14134-0068.flac,said sylvia shivering all over with passion
9446,5339-14134-0035.flac,she hastily got up and left the room
9447,5339-14134-0052.flac,bruntonsels jeese and that's no better philip promised to do his best and to write word to robson who satisfied with his willingness to undertake the commission bade him go on and see if he could not find the lass
9448,5339-14134-0064.flac,suddenly a light shone down into philip's mind his voice was changed as he spoke next
9449,5339-14134-0005.flac,a minute ago philip and he were on a level of ignorance from which the former was evidently going to be raised but he soon returned to his usual state of acquiescence in things as they were which was partly constitutional and partly the result of his quaker training
9450,5339-14134-0011.flac,after much perplexed consultation john had hit upon the plan of sending hetburn to london to make secret inquiries respecting the true character and commercial position of the man whose creditors not a month ago they had esteemed it an honour to be
9451,5339-14134-0054.flac,glittering icebergs bearing mercilessly down on the urania nor shuddering anticipation of the dark waves of evil import crossed her mind he loved her and that was enough her eyes looked trancelike into a dim glorious future of life
9452,5339-14134-0057.flac,but she turned it off with assumed lightness oh yes
9453,5339-14134-0066.flac,that the half of some silver coin was among the contents thus turned over before the box was locked but thy mother wouldn't like it sylvie he's played false with other lasses he'll be playing thee false some o these days if thou let's him come about thee
9454,5339-14134-0073.flac,at length he raised his stiffened body and stood up dizzy up the little wooden stairs he went where he had never been before to the small square landing almost filled up with the great chest for oat cake he breathed hard for a minute and then knocked at the door of sylvia's room
9455,5339-14134-0030.flac,an the responsibility which it involved and his unwillingness to leave monkshaven he said coulson i'd give a deal it were thou that were going and not me at least there's many a time i'd give a deal
9456,5339-14134-0019.flac,the latter was silent brooding over the confidence which philip had apparently received but which was withheld from him he did not yet know of the culminating point of philip's proposed journey to london
9457,5339-14134-0040.flac,they had seen him already or his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid them even though one of his purposes in going to haytersbank had been to bid his uncle farewell kinraid took him by surprise from the hearty greeting he gave him
9458,5339-14134-0058.flac,penitently as if anxious to be forgiven sylvia did not want his penitence did not care for her ribbon was troubled by his earnestness of manner but he knew nothing of all that he only knew
9459,4340-15220-0032.flac,and the third swinging forward to a light on his head i'm going said sam with calm decision for this superb array of unknown pleasures fired his soul and made him forget his weight how will you fix it asked ben
9460,4340-15220-0085.flac,advised sam thinking bab great fun

9462,4340-15220-0065.flac,which hid the king of beasts from his longing sight that was a cow mooing don't you be a donkey bill when you hear a real roar you'll shake in your boots said ben holding up his handkerchief to dry
9463,4340-15220-0041.flac,smoothing away all objections for he liked ben and saw that he wanted to go no i won't i don't like him he winks at me and growls when i touch him muttered naughty sy remembering how much reason poor sanch had to distrust his tormentor
9464,4340-15220-0047.flac,whispered fay hoping to make mischief circus
9465,4340-15220-0001.flac,tired teacher had dismissed them for eight whole weeks and gone away to rest the little schoolhouse was shut up lessons were over spirits rising fast and vacation had begun the quiet town seemed suddenly inundated with children
9466,4340-15220-0056.flac,and we don't want to walk fast ben spoke very decidedly and taking billy's arm away they went leaving poor bab and sanch to watch them out of sight one sobbing the other whining dismally
9467,4340-15220-0070.flac,bab with a face as red as a lobster and streaked with tears shoes white with dust play frock torn at the gathers something bundled up in her apron and one shoe down at the heel as if it hurt her
9468,4340-15220-0021.flac,though you might do for a fat boy if smithers wanted one said ben surveying the stout youth with calm contempt let's go and swimming not loaf around here if we can't play
9469,4340-15220-0014.flac,growled sam kitteridge bitterly resenting the stern edict which forbade free born citizens to burn as much gunpowder as they lacked on that glorious day last year jimmy got his arm blown off when they fired the old cannon
9470,4340-15220-0092.flac,fishing out several fragments of gingerbread starving and bab ate them with such a relish that sam added a small contribution and ben caught some water for her in his hand where the little spring bubbled up beside a stone now
9471,4340-15220-0076.flac,trying to pull him after her as she trudged on bound to see the outside of that wonderful tent even if she never got in but sancho had heard a soft chirp and with a sudden bound twitched the strap away sprang up the bank
9472,4340-15220-0090.flac,i'll take care of her it was very naughty to come bab but so long as you did you needn't worry about anything i'll see to you and you shall have a real good time said ben accepting his responsibilities without a murmur
9473,4340-15220-0005.flac,the boys took to baseball like ducks to water and the common was the scene of tremendous battles waged with much tumult but little bloodshed to the uninitiated it appeared as if these young men had lost their wits
9474,4340-15220-0022.flac,proposed a red and shiny boy panting for a game of leap frog and sandy pond may as well don't see much else to do sighed sam rising like a young elephant the others were about to follow
9475,4340-15220-0095.flac,in a swampy place coming along sanch saw something down there and i went with him cause i thought maybe it was a muskrat and you'd like one if we could get him
9476,4340-15220-0072.flac,bab still held the strap intent on keeping her charge safe though she lost herself but her courage seemed to be giving out as she looked anxiously up and down the road
9477,4340-15220-0007.flac,as if their lives depended on it every one talking in his gruffest tone bawling at the top of his voice squabbling over every point of the game and seeming to enjoy himself immensely in spite of the heat dust uproar
9478,4340-15220-0079.flac,before ben could quiet them bab came climbing up the bank with such a funny mixture of fear fatigue determination and relief in her dirty little face
9479,4340-15220-0058.flac,he could not help feeling that he ought to have asked leave to go and been kinder to bab
9480,4340-15220-0029.flac,the zebra to be jumping over the seal the hippopotamus to be lunching off a couple of crocodiles and lions and tigers to be raining down in all directions with their mouths wide open and their tails as stiff as that of the famous northumberland house lion
9481,4340-15220-0046.flac,you just catch hold of this and run along home lock satch up for an hour and tell your mother i'm all right answered ben bound to assert his manly supremacy before his mates he's going to the circus
9482,4340-15220-0087.flac,was the prompt answer but you haven't got any money oh i'd ask somebody to pay for me i'm so little it wouldn't be much
9483,4340-15220-0009.flac,ben was a promising pupil and made rapid progress for eye foot and hand had been so well trained that they did him good service now and brown was considered a thirst rate catcher
9484,4340-15220-0015.flac,didn't we have a lovely time going for the doctors and getting him home asked another boy looking as if he felt defrauded of the most interesting part of the anniversary because no accident had occurred ain't going to be fireworks either unless somebody's
9485,4340-15220-0013.flac,so they lay about on the grass in the shade of the big elm languidly discussing the various wrongs and disappointments it's the meanest forth i ever saw can't have no crackers because somebody's horse got scared last year
9486,4340-15220-0091.flac,and bound to do the handsome thing by his persistent friend i thought you would and bab folded her arms as if she had nothing further to do but enjoy herself are you hungry asked billy
9487,4340-15220-0093.flac,commanded ben giving sanch a roll in the grass to clean thim bab scrubbed her face till it shone and pulling down her apron to wipe it scattered a load of treasures collected in her walk some of the dead flowers
9488,4340-15220-0069.flac,and both suppressed an astonished hullo for there stood bab waiting for sancho to lap his fill out of the overflowing trough such a shabby tired looking couple as they were
9489,4340-15220-0008.flac,an imminent danger of getting eyes or teeth knocked out thorny was an excellent player but not being strong enough to show his prowess he made bend his proxy and sitting on the fence acted as umpire to his heart's content
9490,4340-15220-0033.flac,just as he used to feel it when his father caught him up to dash into the ring foot it with billy it's only four miles and we've got lots of time so we can take it easy mother won't care if i send word by sye
9491,4340-15220-0068.flac,as he looked before he leaped he beheld a sight which caused him to stare with all his might for an instant then turn and beckon saying in an eager whisper
9492,4340-15220-0042.flac,there's bab she'll do it come here cissy ben wants you called sam beckoning to a small figure just perching on the fence down it jumped and came fluttering up
9493,4340-15220-0048.flac,falling into a state of great excitement at the mere thought of such delight you couldn't walk four miles began ben yes i could as easy as not you haven't got any money you have i saw you showing your dollar
9494,4340-15220-0003.flac,while wishing the young folk well secretly blessed the man who invented schools the girls immediately began to talk about picnics and have them too for little hats sprung up in the fields like a new sort of mushroom
9495,4340-15220-0078.flac,licking his face in spite of his struggles burrowing in his neck with a ticklish nose snapping at his buttons and yelping joyfully as if it was the best joke in the world to play hide and seek for four long miles
9496,4340-15220-0044.flac,ben spoke without looking up and affected to be very busy buckling a strap into sanch's collar for the two were so seldom parted that the dog always rebelled it was a mistake on ben's part for
9497,4340-15220-0098.flac,and i shouldn't wonder if you'd got poisoned bab don't touch it
9498,4340-15220-0045.flac,while his eyes were on his work babs were devouring the bill which sam still held
9499,4340-15220-0060.flac,and planning to do the honors handsomely to the boys it was very warm and just outside of the town they paused by a wayside watering trough to wash their dusty faces
9500,4340-15220-0086.flac,what would you have done if you hadn't found us asked billy forgetting his impatience in his admiration for this plucky young lady i'd have gone on and seen the circus
9501,4340-15220-0040.flac,he'll get lost or stolen if i take him and it's too far to carry him home if you're in a hurry began ben persuading himself that this was the true reason of his delay let's si take him back he'll do it for a cent won't you si proposed billy
9502,4340-15220-0062.flac,and climbing the green bank above they lay on the grass under a wild cherry tree munching luxuriously while they feasted their eyes at the same time on the splendors awaiting them for the great tent with all its flags fying
9503,4340-15220-0012.flac,unpropitious thorny had gone out of town with his sister to pass the day two of the best players did not appear and the others were somewhat exhausted by the festivities which began at sunrise for them
9504,4340-15220-0082.flac,and sam tried again while ben was getting the dog down and sitting on him now you expect to go to the circus i suppose course i do ben said he didn't mind paying if i could get there without bothering him and i have
9505,4340-15220-0002.flac,all in such a rampined state that busy mothers wondered how they ever should be able to keep their frisky darlings out of mischief thrifty fathers planned how they could bribe the idle hands to pick berries or rake hay and the old folks
9506,4340-15220-0064.flac,i want to have a good go at everything especially the lions said sam beginning on his last cookie i heard em roar just now and billy stood up to gaze with big eyes at the flapping canvas
9507,4340-15220-0071.flac,sancho lapped eagerly with his eyes shut all his ruffles were gray with dust and his tail hung wearily down the tassel at half mast as if in mourning for the master whom he had come to find
9508,4340-15220-0063.flac,was visible from the hill we'll cut across those fields
9509,4340-15220-0020.flac,and getting a smart rap across the nose as he failed to perform the feat much you know about it old chap it's hard work i can tell you and that wouldn't suit such a lazy bones then you are too big to begin
9510,4340-15220-0000.flac,chapter thirteen somebody runs away school is done now we'll have fun sung bab and betty
9511,4340-15220-0019.flac,and felt some natural regret at descending from so lofty a sphere catch me cuttin away if i had such a chance as that answered sam trying to balance his bat on his chin
9512,4340-15220-0081.flac,i couldn't make him go home so i had to hold on till he was safe here else he'd be lost and then ben would feel bad the cleverness of that excuse tickled the boys immensely
9513,4340-15220-0061.flac,and cool off before plunging into the excitements of the afternoon as they stood refreshing themselves a baker's cart came jingling by and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested a supply of gingerbread was soon bought
9514,4340-15220-0094.flac,bits of moss and green twigs fell near ben and one attracted his attention a spray of broad smooth leaves with a bunch of whitish berries on it where did you get that he asked poking it with his foot
9515,4340-15220-0074.flac,and there isn't any other road to the circus seems to me bab spoke as if the dog could understand and answer
9516,4340-15220-0043.flac,i want you to take sanch home and tell your mother i'm going to walk and maybe won't be back till sundown miss celia said i might do what i pleased all day you remember now
9517,4340-15220-0051.flac,don't you bother we don't want any girls tagging after us said sam walking off to escape the annoyance i'll bring you a roll of chickerberry lozengers if you won't tease
9518,4340-15220-0016.flac,barn burns up don't i just wish there would gloomily responded another youth who had so rashly indulged in piratechnics on a former occasion that a neighbor's cow had been roasted whole
9519,4340-15220-0053.flac,they never do come to such little towns you said so and i think you are very cross and i won't take care of sanch so now cried bab getting into a passion yet ready to cry she was so disappointed
9520,4340-15220-0010.flac,and guarding jackets when not needed with the air of one of the old guard on juty at the tomb of napoleon bab also longed to join in the fun which suited her better than stupid picnics or fussing over dolls
9521,4340-15220-0018.flac,all in my best toggery hot as pepper but good fun lookin in at the upper windows and hearing the women scream when the old thing waggled round and i made believe i was going to tumble off said ben
9522,4340-15220-0038.flac,observing with dignity i've got money enough to treat the whole crowd if i choose to which i don't then come along and have a jolly time with sam and me we can buy some dinner and get a ride home as like as not
9523,4340-15220-0055.flac,girls are such a bother when you want to knock around no bab you can't go travel right home and don't make a fuss come along boys
9524,4340-15220-0006.flac,for no matter how warm it was there they were tearing about in the maddest manner jackets off sleeves rolled up queer caps flung on any way all batting shabby leather balls and catching the same
9525,4340-15220-0023.flac,tearing down the street like a runaway colt waving a long strip of paper as he ran now then what's the matter demanded ben as the other came up grinning and puffing but full of great news
9526,4340-15220-0096.flac,and with intense interest no only a snake and i don't care for snakes i picked some of that it was so green and pretty thorny likes queer leaves and berries you know answered bab spatting down her rough locks
9527,4340-15220-0097.flac,well he won't like that nor you either
9528,4340-15220-0024.flac,panted billy putting the paper into sam's hand and surveying the crowd with a face as beaming as a full moon look out for the big show redd sam
9529,4340-15220-0017.flac,i wouldn't give two cents for such a slow old place as this why last fourth at this time
9530,4340-15220-0039.flac,said the amiable billy with a slap on the shoulder and a cordial grin which made it impossible for ben to resist what are you stopping for demanded sam ready to be off that they might take it easy
9531,4340-15220-0054.flac,i suppose it wouldn't do hinted billy with a look from ben to the little girl who stood winking hard to keep the tears back of course it wouldn't i'd like to see her walking eight miles
9532,4340-15220-0100.flac,not for a day or so i guess but it's bad when it does come
9533,4340-15220-0067.flac,hold on a minute while i get one more drink buns are dry fodder said sam rolling over to the edge of the bank and preparing to descend with as little trouble as possible he nearly went down head first however for
9534,4340-15220-0052.flac,whispered kind hearted billy with a consoling pat on the crown of the shabby straw hat when the circus comes here you shall go certain sure and betty too said ben feeling mean while he proposed what he knew was a hollow mockery
9535,4340-15220-0030.flac,cricky wouldn't i like to see that said little cyrus fay devoutly hoping that the cage in which this pleasing spectacle took place was a very strong one you never would it's only a picture
9536,4340-15220-0088.flac,i thought of that and planned how i'd fix it if i didn't find ben i'd make sanch to his tricks and get a quarter that way so now answered bab undaunted by any obstacle i do believe she would
9537,4340-15220-0066.flac,i wish you'd hurry up sam folks are going in now i see em and billy pranced with impatience for this was his first circus and he firmly believed that he was going to behold all that the pictures promised
9538,4340-15220-0027.flac,filled with noble beings and helmets all playing on immense trumpets the twenty four prancing steeds with manes tails and feathered heads tossing in the breeze the clowns the tumblers the strong men
9539,4340-15220-0050.flac,she isn't my missis now miss celia wouldn't care and i'm going anyway do do take me ben i'll be just as good as ever was
9540,4340-15220-0011.flac,but her heroes would not have her at any price and she was obliged to content herself with sitting by thorny and watching with breathless interest the varying fortunes of our side a grand match was planned for the fourth of july but when the club met
9541,4340-15220-0049.flac,and you could pay for me and ma would pay it back can't wait for you to get ready i'll go as i am i don't care if it is my old hat and bab jerked it on to her head your mother wouldn't like it she won't like your going either
9542,4340-15220-0034.flac,answered sam producing half a dollar as if such magnificent sums were no strangers to his pocket come on brown you'll be a first rate fellow to show us round as you know all the dudges said billy
9543,4340-15220-0073.flac,seeing no sign of the three familiar figures she had been following as steadily as a little indian on the war trail oh snanch what shall i do if they don't come along we must have gone by them somewhere for i don't see any one that way
9544,4340-15220-0004.flac,every hillside bloomed with gay gowns looking as if the flowers had gone out for a walk and the woods were full of featherless birds chirping away as blithely as the thrushes robins and wrens
9545,4340-15220-0036.flac,who felt bitterly toward all mankind at that instant because he knew there was no hope of his going say that again and i'll knock your head off and ben faced round with a gesture which caused the other to skip out of reach precipitately
9546,4340-15220-0035.flac,anxious to get his money's worth well i don't know began ben longing to go but afraid missus moss would say no if he asked leave he's afraid sneered the red faced boy
9547,4340-15220-0083.flac,and i'll go home alone i ain't afraid sanch will take care of me if you won't answered bab stoutly what do you suppose your mother will say to you asked ben feeling much reproached by her last words
9548,4340-15220-0028.flac,and the riders flying about in the air as if the laws of gravitation no longer existed but best of all was the grand conglomeration of animals where the grav appears to stand on the elephant's back
9549,4340-15220-0031.flac,that now is something like and ben who had pricked up his ears at the word circus laid his finger on a smaller cut of a man hanging by the back of his neck with a child in each hand two men suspended from his feet
9550,4340-15220-0089.flac,you are a smart child bab and if i had enough i'd take you in myself said billy heartily for having sisters of his own he kept a soft place in his heart for girls especially enterprising ones
9551,4340-15220-0026.flac,don't forget day and date h frost manager while sam read the other boys had been gloating about the enticing pictures which covered the bill there was the golden car
9552,4340-15220-0099.flac,and ben looked anxiously at bab who felt her chubby face all over and examined her dinny hands with a solemn air asking eagerly will it break out on me fore i get to the circus
9553,4340-15220-0077.flac,and landed directly on ben's back as he lay peeping over a peal of laughter greeted him and having got the better of his master in more ways than one he made the most of the advantage by playfully worrying him as he kept him down
9554,4340-15220-0080.flac,that the boys could not look awful if they tried how dared you come after us miss demanded sam as she looked calmly about her and took a seat before she was asked sanch would come after ben
9555,4340-15220-0059.flac,if i' told her i'd like to show her round and she's been real good to me no use now i'll take the girls a lot of candy and make it all right he tried to settle it in that way and trudged gaily off
9556,4340-15220-0075.flac,and fixing his sharp eyes on the grass above him gave a suspicious bark it's only squirrels don't mind but come along and be good for i'm so tired i don't know what to do sighed bab
9557,4340-15220-0037.flac,hasn't got any money more likely observed a shabby youth whose pockets never had anything in them but a pair of dirty hands ben calmly produced a dollar bill and waved it defiantly before this doubter
9558,198-129977-0009.flac,i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories gray moss and brushwood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
9559,198-129977-0011.flac,and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery
9560,198-129977-0016.flac,marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister
9561,198-129977-0022.flac,that it was exactly the shade of her own edward's embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said
9562,198-129977-0017.flac,till a new object suddenly engaged her attention she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from missus dashwood his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plate of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers
9563,198-129977-0030.flac,edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
9564,198-129977-0005.flac,this was a subject which insured marianne's attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes
9565,198-129977-0008.flac,the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber
9566,198-129977-0001.flac,while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring
9567,198-129977-0012.flac,has become a mere jargon everybody pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself
9568,198-129977-0028.flac,what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone i wish it with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again this and marianne's blushing gave new suspicions to edward
9569,198-129977-0027.flac,missus jennings enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she and that will tempt you miss marianne a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance who why yourselves and the carreys and the whittakers to be sure
9570,198-129977-0007.flac,which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country
9571,198-129977-0025.flac,but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret's instruction extended sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening
9572,198-129977-0010.flac,i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel
9573,198-129977-0014.flac,but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing
9574,198-129977-0021.flac,she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt
9575,198-129977-0031.flac,what do you mean shall i tell you certainly well then i guess that mister willoughby huns marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment's silence said
9576,198-129977-0003.flac,he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open
9577,198-129977-0024.flac,that the name of ferrers began with an f and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung
9578,198-129977-0000.flac,elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction
9579,198-129977-0002.flac,but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had indimated the preceding one
9580,198-129977-0020.flac,that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself
9581,198-129977-0004.flac,as you are not yet ready for breakfast
9582,198-129977-0023.flac,before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and missus jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest with the assistance of his mother in law sir john was not long in discovering
9583,198-129977-0006.flac,when edward interrupted her by saying you must not inquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars
9584,198-129977-0019.flac,he colored very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sister's hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise
9585,198-129977-0013.flac,because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you professed to fil
9586,198-129977-0029.flac,and who is willoughby said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting she gave him a brief reply
9587,198-129977-0026.flac,on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both you must drink tea with us to night said he
9588,198-129977-0018.flac,but i should have thought her hair had been darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his
9589,198-129977-0032.flac,hope i am sure you will like him
9590,198-129977-0015.flac,i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles an thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farmhouse than a watch tower
9591,198-209-0015.flac,to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct
9592,198-209-0032.flac,what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mister thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry
9593,198-209-0020.flac,and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
9594,198-209-0006.flac,at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgar's buildings
9595,198-209-0002.flac,and missus allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful to milsolm street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven
9596,198-209-0005.flac,and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there
9597,198-209-0038.flac,lowering his voice well done general said i i am quite of your mind
9598,198-209-0025.flac,and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you
9599,198-209-0007.flac,catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be clasped by the laws of worldly politeness
9600,198-209-0011.flac,on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mister henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention
9601,198-209-0036.flac,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him for ever at the bedford and i knew his face again to day the moment he came into the billiard room one of the finest players we have by the bye and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first
9602,198-209-0016.flac,or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat but his father remained
9603,198-209-0028.flac,nay iam sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time
9604,198-209-0000.flac,missus allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney to day i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
9605,198-209-0012.flac,every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play
9606,198-209-0004.flac,and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said that he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home and too much offended to admit her
9607,198-209-0035.flac,in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with general tilney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you
9608,198-209-0001.flac,catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilney's lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house
9609,198-209-0024.flac,perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father
9610,198-209-0008.flac,to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety leave nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night
9611,198-209-0013.flac,his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes
9612,198-209-0009.flac,for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second
9613,198-209-0031.flac,was engaged in conversation with general tilney
9614,198-209-0029.flac,and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box
9615,198-209-0030.flac,she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other
9616,198-209-0018.flac,you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it missus allen did not they tell me that mister tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaatin together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you
9617,198-209-0023.flac,and dependence on catherine's honor oh do not say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted
9618,198-209-0003.flac,tripping lightly through the churchyard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number
9619,198-209-0037.flac,the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew
9620,198-209-0010.flac,to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared to plague or please her she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage
9621,198-209-0019.flac,my dear you tumble my gown was missus allen's reply her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance
9622,198-209-0026.flac,and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information yet as something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mister tilney
9623,198-209-0021.flac,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mister thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now missus allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mister thorpe would only have stopped
9624,198-209-0027.flac,why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence me i take offence
9625,198-209-0034.flac,when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking
9626,198-209-0017.flac,and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared
9627,198-209-0033.flac,as she pointed them out to her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man
9628,198-209-0022.flac,i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sister's concern regret
9629,198-209-0014.flac,and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence
9630,198-126831-0045.flac,uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door as he did so clear and sweet rang out ten bell like trimes
9631,198-126831-0025.flac,you'd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever woman looked at him they say it's pitiful to see him i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl
9632,198-126831-0037.flac,don't cried cecily hysterically don't you go on don't you say another word i can't bear it don't you the story girl didn't but she had said enough
9633,198-126831-0005.flac,while cecily admitted that willy fraser had written on his late and showed it to her if you love me as i love you no knife can cut our love in two but sarah ray never you breathe this to a living soul
9634,198-126831-0041.flac,was white and clear against the dark background of spruces we were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew the family ghost only appears in daylight said the story girl
9635,198-126831-0030.flac,there we stood in a huddled demoralized group oh what an erie place that orchard was what shadows what noises
9636,198-126831-0026.flac,if i put it off any longer it will be too late i'm growing so fast aunt olivia says i'll have to wear ankleskirts next summer if i begin to look grown up he'll get frightened of me and then i'll never find out the golden milestone mystery
9637,198-126831-0032.flac,somebody killed or something like that you know nothing like that ever happened in our family the kings have always been respectable perhaps it is emily
9638,198-126831-0028.flac,and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights off to the west was a daffledule glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets
9639,198-126831-0040.flac,he was a strange furtive animal a questing beast presently the moon rose but this only made matters worse the shadows had been still before now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs the old house with its dreadful secret
9640,198-126831-0029.flac,and i got back about fifteen minutes ago i set down on the front door steps for a moment and all at once i heard a bell ring in the house eight times i tell you i was skeered i made a bolt for the orchard and you won't catch me going near the house till your uncle roger comes home
9641,198-126831-0051.flac,it don't sound a bit like other clocks
9642,198-126831-0014.flac,i'd like to sighed felicity but we'd come home tired and with all the milking to do you boys better go alone peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger you can all go
9643,198-126831-0012.flac,the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked aunt janet's thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse uncle roger ate three slizes of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist
9644,198-126831-0015.flac,i have an idea that a raspberry pie for to morrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her
9645,198-126831-0006.flac,cecily how old must we be before we can have a real beau but sara always denied it so i am inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself patty distinguished himself by catching a rat
9646,198-126831-0019.flac,i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward said the story girl dreamily and i think there is a way of getting there too if we could only find it
9647,198-126831-0000.flac,friday was a comfortable day in the household of king everybody was in a good humor the story girl sparkled through several tales that ranged from the afrites and ginns of eastern myth through the piping days of chivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlyle wookday folks
9648,198-126831-0039.flac,he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps
9649,198-126831-0031.flac,well here's the key go and see for yourself said peter felicity had no intention of going and seeing i think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex you ought to be braver than girls
9650,198-126831-0050.flac,it's all peter's fault said felicity i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing
9651,198-126831-0011.flac,felicity tried and had the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe a gorgeous compound
9652,198-126831-0021.flac,and that is the tragedy of life on that day the gates of eden are shut behind them and age of gold is over henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again
9653,198-126831-0033.flac,king's ghost whispered felix she never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the story girl oh oh children isn't there something under uncle alec's tree we peered fearfully through the gloom there was something something that wavered and fluttered advanced retreated
9654,198-126831-0044.flac,there's no use asking the meaning of this i suppose said uncle roger with the calm of despair i've gave up trying to fathom you young ones peter where's the key what yarn have you been telling
9655,198-126831-0009.flac,the story girl would box his ears with her fist and say bless your gray heart patty you're a good sort of old rascal and pat would pur his satisfaction i used to take a handful of the skin on his back shake him gently and say
9656,198-126831-0002.flac,with e highway man on a moonlit heath and buskirk girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated
9657,198-126831-0052.flac,i wouldn't have said the story girl honestly i thought it was a bell when i heard it and the door open too let us be fair felicity
9658,198-126831-0020.flac,one bitter day when they seek it
9659,198-126831-0004.flac,chancing accidentally i vow to overhear certain of these secrets i learned that sara ray had named an apple for johnny price and cecily true as you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love
9660,198-126831-0001.flac,she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silken veil the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wors of palestine disguised as a page the gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a coronto
9661,198-126831-0049.flac,i shall tell it too i don't care if the joke is as much on myself as anyone a story is a story no matter who it's on but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown ups always do it i never will when i'm grown up i'll remember better
9662,198-126831-0053.flac,but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that a saucerful apiece
9663,198-126831-0043.flac,we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door he stared at us in the moonlight
9664,198-126831-0047.flac,and now it has almost frightened your poor little monkeys to death we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn
9665,198-126831-0027.flac,do you think he'll ever tell you who alice is i asked i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature but she would tell us nothing more when the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward
9666,198-126831-0036.flac,no it isn't peg bowen it's something that walks i know a story about a ghost said the story girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes
9667,198-126831-0008.flac,very few cats have and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon patty had a finer taste the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking
9668,198-126831-0018.flac,who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright and if you drink of the cup with her said the story girl her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us you were never seen in the world again you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with the fairy bride
9669,198-126831-0038.flac,all at once something leaped from the bough of a tree and alighted before us we split the air with a simultaneous shriek
9670,198-126831-0042.flac,i know he'll laugh at us awful but it's better to be laughed at than scared like this uncle roger did not come home till nearly ten never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in that lane
9671,198-126831-0013.flac,the poor man meant it as a compliment but felicity who knew uncle blair was an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasn't
9672,198-126831-0046.flac,we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation we thought he never would stop
9673,198-126831-0017.flac,then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies and the story girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glan where a fair white lady dwelt
9674,198-126831-0010.flac,pat you've forgotten more than any human being ever knew and i vow patty would lick his chops with delight but to be called a sweet cat oh sara sara
9675,198-126831-0048.flac,i was so frightened i wouldn't mind if he'd laugh once and have it done with it
9676,198-126831-0035.flac,there was not a great deal of comfort in this we were almost as much afraid of peg bowen as we would be of any spectral visiant peter scoffed at the idea peg bowen wasn't in the house before your uncle roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards he said
9677,198-126831-0024.flac,he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed the story girl kissed her finger tips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her
9678,198-126831-0023.flac,as we sat there the awkward man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side he did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods
9679,198-126831-0022.flac,they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles the world calls them its singers and poets and artists and story tellers
9680,198-126831-0034.flac,that's only my old apron said felicity i hung ut there to day when i was looking for that white hen's nest oh what shall we do uncle roger may not be back for hours i can't believe there's anything in the house maybe it's only peg bowen suggested dan
9681,198-126831-0016.flac,a pretty walk through a world of green whispering boughs and spice sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight the raspberries were plentiful
9682,198-126831-0003.flac,cecily and sarah ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine
9683,198-126831-0007.flac,and being intolerably conceited about it until sarah ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears then pat sneaked abjectly off his tail drooping
9684,248-130652-0027.flac,extremely well fitted to make a rumpus she would know what she liked she doesn't like you said grandcourt with the ghost of a smile perfectly true said lush adding again in a markedly sneering tone
9685,248-130652-0016.flac,grandcourt like many others had two remarkably different voices hitherto we have heard him speaking in a superficial interrupted drawl suggestive chiefly of languor
9686,248-130652-0019.flac,when he said perhaps in a lower tone than ever but with a perceptible edge of contempt what in the name of nonsense have i to do with miss arrowpoint and her music
9687,248-130652-0022.flac,and the daughter's looks and manners require no allowances any more than if she hadn't a sixpence she is not beautiful but equal to carrying any rank and she is not likely to refuse such prospects as you can offer her
9688,248-130652-0002.flac,the still life in the room which seemed the stiller for its sober antiquated elegance as if it kept a conscious well bred silence unlike the restlessness of vulgar furniture whether the gentlemen were agreeable to each other was less evident
9689,248-130652-0035.flac,and a gentleman's dog should be kicked for him he only said things which might have exposed himself to be kicked if his confident had been a man of independent spirit
9690,248-130652-0000.flac,chapter twelve oh gentlemen the time of life is short to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dial's point still ending at the arrival of an hour shakespeare
9691,248-130652-0006.flac,he held in his lap a tiny maltise dog with a tiny silver collar and bell and when he had a hand unused by cigar or coffee cup it rested on this small parcel of animal warmth
9692,248-130652-0014.flac,silence for a couple of minutes then grandcourt said what men are invited here with their wives
9693,248-130652-0015.flac,then there are mister hollis and lady flora and the couchats and the gogoffs rather a ragged lot remarked grandcourt after awhile why did you ask the gogoffs
9694,248-130652-0008.flac,who poor thing whimpered interruptedly as if trying to repress that sign of discontent and at last rested her head beside the appealing paw looking up with piteous beseeching so at least a lover of dogs must have interpreted fetch
9695,248-130652-0004.flac,gave a vacillating preference first to one gentleman then to the other being dogs in such good circumstances that they could play at hunger and liked to be served with delicacies which they declined to put in their mouths all except fetch
9696,248-130652-0001.flac,on the second day after the archery meeting mister henley mallinger grandcourt was at his breakfast table with mister lush everything around them was agreeable
9697,248-130652-0007.flac,grandcourt looked at her with unchanged face for half a minute and then took the trouble to lay down his cigar while he lifted the unimpassioned fluff close to his chin and gave it caressing pats all the while gravely watching fetch
9698,248-130652-0012.flac,shall you ride or drive to quetcham to day i am not going to quetcham you did not go yesterday grandcourt smoked in silence for half a minute and then said
9699,248-130652-0018.flac,lush spoke carelessly but he was really seizing an opportunity and fixing an observant look on grandcourt who now for the first time turned his eyes toward his companion but slowly and without speaking until he had given two long luxuriant puffs
9700,248-130652-0005.flac,the beautiful liver colored water spaniel which sat with its forepaws firmly planted and its expressive brown face turned upward watching grandcourt with unshaken constancy
9701,248-130652-0024.flac,and then he said in a deep voice of remonstrance good god grandcourt after your experience will you let a whim interfere with your comfortable settlement in life spare your oratory i know what i am going to do
9702,248-130652-0030.flac,check old boy lush being a man of some ability had not known grandcourt for fifteen years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him though what sort might be useful remained often dubious
9703,248-130652-0038.flac,since in his own opinion he had never done a bad action it did not seem necessary to consider whether he should be likely to commit one if his love of ease required it lush's love of ease was well satisfied at present
9704,248-130652-0031.flac,in the beginning of his career he held a fellowship and was near taking orders for the sake of a college living but not being fond of that prospect accepted instead the office of travelling companion to a marquesse and afterward to young grandcourt
9705,248-130652-0011.flac,turn out that brute will you said grandcourt to lush without raising his voice or looking at him as if he counted on attention to the smallest sign and lush immediately rose lifted fetch though she was rather heavy
9706,248-130652-0021.flac,that's a pity to fling away an opportunity of this sort and knock down your own plans your plans i suppose you mean you have some debts you know and things may turn out inconveniently after all
9707,248-130652-0037.flac,living generally in the most luxuriant honey blossomed clover and all without working mister lush had passed for a scholar once and had still a sense of scholarship when he was not trying to remember much of it
9708,248-130652-0026.flac,have you fallen in love this question carried a strong sneer i am going to marry her you have made her an offer already then no she is a young lady with a will of her own i fancy
9709,248-130652-0017.flac,and one of your damned musicians but not a comic fellow i wonder if clesmer would consent to come to us when he leaves kuetcham nothing but first class music will go down with miss arrowpoint
9710,248-130652-0009.flac,and grandcourt kept so many dogs that he was reputed to love them at any rate his impulse to act just in that way started from such an interpretation but when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling bark
9711,248-130652-0032.flac,who had lost his father early and who found lush so convenient that he had allowed him to become prime minister in all his more personal affairs the habit of fifteen years had made grandcourt more and more in need of lush's handiness
9712,248-130652-0036.flac,but what son of a vicar who has stinted his wife and daughters of calico in order to send his male offspring to oxford can keep an independent spirit when he is bent on dining with high discrimination riding good horses
9713,248-130652-0010.flac,that the brute of a cigar required relighting fetch having begun to wail found like others of her sex that it was not easy to leave off indeed the second howl was a louder one and the third was like unto it
9714,248-130652-0013.flac,i suppose you sent my card and inquiries i went myself at four and said you were sure to be there shortly they would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the intention especially if you go to day
9715,248-130652-0003.flac,mister grandcourt had drawn his chair aside so as to face the lawn and with his left leg over another chair and his right elbow on the table was smoking a large cigar while his companion was still eating the dogs
9716,248-130652-0028.flac,however if you and she are devoted to each other that will be enough grandcourt took no notice of this speech but sipped his coffee rose and strolled out on the lawn all the dogs following him
9717,248-130652-0020.flac,you need not give yourself much trouble perhaps but some forms must be gone through before a man can marry a million very likely but i am not going to marry a million
9718,248-130652-0033.flac,and lush more and more in need of the lazy luxury to which his transactions on behalf of grandcourt made no interruption worth reckoning i cannot say that the same lengthened habit had intensified grandcourt's want of respect for his companion
9719,248-130652-0039.flac,and if his puddings were rolled toward him in the dust he took the inside bits and found them relishing
9720,248-130652-0025.flac,what lush put down his cigar and thrust his hands into his side pockets as if he had to face something exasperating but meant to keep his temper i am going to marry the other girl
9721,248-130652-0023.flac,perhaps not the father and mother would let you do anything you like with them but i should not like to do anything with them here it was lush who made a little pause before speaking again
9722,248-130652-0034.flac,since that want had been absolute from the beginning but it had confirmed his sense that he might kick lush if he chose only he never did choose to kick any animal because the act of kicking is a compromising attitude
9723,248-130652-0029.flac,lush glanced after him a moment then resumed his cigar and lit it but smoked slowly consulting his beard with inspecting eyes and fingers till he finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some conclusion and said in a subdued voice
9724,248-130697-0011.flac,she spoke hesitatingly i had not thought of them said deronda i was thinking too much of the other things perhaps you don't quite know the beginning of it all said gwendolen slowly as if she were overcoming her reluctance
9725,248-130697-0033.flac,you have saved me from worse said gwendolen in a sobbing voice
9726,248-130697-0016.flac,worth anything worthy enough i shall always be too wicked to the voice broke off helpless deronda's heart was pierced he turned his eyes on her poor beseeching face and said
9727,248-130697-0021.flac,it could never be my impulse to forsake you said deronda promptly with that voice which like his eyes had the unintentional effect of making his ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it really was
9728,248-130697-0008.flac,if it were true that he could swim he must have been seized with cramp with your quickest utmost effort it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save him
9729,248-130697-0025.flac,not till after sir hugo has come but we shall all go to england as soon as possible said deronda not wishing to enter into particulars
9730,248-130697-0022.flac,and in that moment he was not himself quite free from a foreboding of some such self committing effect his strong feeling for this stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future difficulty
9731,248-130697-0010.flac,and sooner or later it works its way outside us it may be in the vitiation that breeds evil acts but also it may be in the self abhorrence that stings us into better striving i am saved from robbing others
9732,248-130697-0036.flac,beholding a possible life which she had sinned herself away from
9733,248-130697-0015.flac,if you did not know how miserable i was you might but now it has all been no use i can care for nothing but saving the rest from knowing poor mamma
9734,248-130697-0029.flac,before my mother comes said gwendolen ah i must be changed i have not looked at myself should you have known me she added turning toward him if you had met me now
9735,248-130697-0035.flac,he rose as he spoke and she gave him her hand submissively but when he had left her she sank on her knees in hysterical crying the distance between them was too great
9736,248-130697-0000.flac,all things are changes not into nothing but into that which is not at present marcus aurulius
9737,248-130697-0017.flac,i believe that you may become worthier than you have ever yet been worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing no evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love and desire to continue in
9738,248-130697-0026.flac,gwendolen looked toward the window again with an expression which seemed like a gradual awakening to new thoughts the twilight was perceptibly deepening
9739,248-130697-0006.flac,presently he heard her cry imploringly you will not say that any one else should know most decidedly not said deronda there is no action that ought to be taken in consequence
9740,248-130697-0005.flac,and again turned with the same expression which yet did not issue in speech there was some fear hindering her and deronda wishing to relieve her timidity averted his face
9741,248-130697-0030.flac,should you have known me for the one you saw at la bron yes i should have known you said deronda mournfully the outside change is not great i should have seen at once that it was you and that you had gone through some great sorrow
9742,248-130697-0018.flac,and make no effort to escape from you have made efforts you will go on making them but you were the beginning of them you must not forsake me said gwendolen leaning with her clasped hands on the arm of her chair and looking at him
9743,248-130697-0013.flac,but then we became poor all at once and i was very miserable and i was tempted i thought i shall do as i like and make everything right i persuaded myself and it was all different it was all dreadful
9744,248-130697-0001.flac,deeds are the pulse of time his beating life and righteous or unrighteous being done must throb in after throbs till time itself be laid in darkness
9745,248-130697-0032.flac,we must find our duties in what comes to us not in what we imagine might have been if i took to foolish wishing of that sort i should wish not that i had never seen you but that i had been able to save you from this
9746,248-130697-0009.flac,that momentary murderous will cannot i think have altered the course of events its effect is confined to the motives in your own breast within ourselves our evil will is momentous
9747,248-130697-0019.flac,while her face bore piteous traces of the life experience concentrated in the twenty four hours that new terrible life lying on the other side of the deed which fulfills a criminal desire i will bear any penance
9748,248-130697-0028.flac,when you are among your friends again you will discern new duties said deronda make it a task now to get as well and calm as much like yourself as you can before he hesitated
9749,248-130697-0023.flac,to an indefinite hope anxieties both immediate and distant crowded on his thought and it was under their influence that after a moment's silence he said
9750,248-130697-0012.flac,there was some one else he ought to have married and i knew it and i told her i would not hinder it and i went away that was when you first saw me
9751,248-130697-0024.flac,and i am not without hope that missus davilow may shortly follow him her presence will be the greatest comfort to you it will give you a motive to save her from unnecessary pain yes yes i will try and you will not go away
9752,248-130697-0031.flac,don't wish now that you had never seen me don't wish that said gwendolen imploringly while the tears gathered i should despise myself for wishing it said deronda how could i know what i was wishing
9753,248-130697-0007.flac,but if i had not had that murderous will that moment if i had thrown the rope on the instant perhaps it would have hindered death no i think not said deronda slowly
9754,248-130697-0003.flac,and the light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open she was seated gazing fixedly on the sea resting her cheek on her hand looking less shattered than when he had left her but with a deep melancholy in her expression
9755,248-130697-0027.flac,or else at diplo i am quite uncertain where i shall live said deronda coloring she was warned by his changed color that she had spoken too rashly and fell silent
9756,248-130697-0002.flac,and the universe quiver and breathe upon no mirror more in the evening she sent for him again it was already near the hour at which she had been brought in from the sea the evening before
9757,248-130697-0004.flac,which as deronda approached her passed into an anxious timidity she did not put out her hand but said how long ago it is then will you sit near me again a little while
9758,248-130697-0034.flac,it will be better for me to go now said deronda worn in spirit by the perpetual strain of this scene remember what we said of your task to get well and calm before other friends come
9759,248-130697-0014.flac,then came hatred and wicked thoughts that was how it all came i told you i was afraid of myself
9760,248-130697-0020.flac,i will lead any life you tell me but you must not forsake me you must be near if you had been near me if i could have said everything to you i should have been different you will not forsake me
9761,248-130644-0035.flac,for macbeth's rhetoric about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the same moment referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to the subtler possibilities of feeling we cannot speak a loyal word and be meanly silent
9762,248-130644-0021.flac,for subjects are apt to appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old but she would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had turned up in conversation it must be remembered that no one had disputed her power or her general superiority
9763,248-130644-0026.flac,always she was the princess in exile who in time of famine was to have her breakfast roll made of the finest bolted flour from the seven thin ears of wheat and in a general decampment was to have her silver fork kept out of the baggage
9764,248-130644-0006.flac,that she was to be married some time or other she would have felt obliged to admit and that her marriage would not be of a middling kind such as most girls were contented with she felt quietly unargumentatively sure
9765,248-130644-0028.flac,a decision of will which made itself felt in her graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones so that if she came into the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the use of things in general was not apparent to them
9766,248-130644-0010.flac,she could not look forward to a single life but promotions have sometimes to be taken with bitter herbs a peerage will not quite do instead of leadership to the men who meant to lead and this delicate limbed sylph of twenty meant to lead
9767,248-130644-0020.flac,who can wonder if gwendolen felt ready to manage her own destiny there were many subjects in the world perhaps the majority and which she felt no interest because they were stupid
9768,248-130644-0004.flac,and he did not even think of getting a too frisky horse in order that gwendolen might be threatened with an accident and be rescued by a man of property he wished his niece well and he meant her to be seen to advantage in the best society of the neighborhood
9769,248-130644-0002.flac,it is rather to be set down to his credit that his feelings on the subject were entirely good natured and in considering the relation of means to ends it would have been mere folly to have been guided by the exceptional and idyllic
9770,248-130644-0022.flac,what will gwendolen think if the footman trod heavily in creaking boots or if the laundress's work was unsatisfactory the maid said this will never do for miss harlith
9771,248-130644-0015.flac,the archery club and invitations to dine with the arrow points as the highest lights in her scenery was not a position that seemed to offer remarkable chances but gwendolen's confidence lay chiefly in herself
9772,248-130644-0011.flac,for such passions dwell in feminine breasts also in gwendolen's however they dwelt among strictly feminine furniture and had no disturbing reference to the advancement of learning or the balance of the constitution
9773,248-130644-0014.flac,but would make the very best of the chances that life offered her and conquer circumstances by her exceptional cleverness
9774,248-130644-0030.flac,this potent charm added to the fact that she was the eldest daughter toward whom her mamma had always been in an apologetic state of mind for the evils brought on her by a stepfather may seem so full a reason for gwendolen's domestic empire
9775,248-130644-0034.flac,the fear and the fondness being perhaps both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her character the play of various nay contrary tendencies
9776,248-130644-0025.flac,it was always she herself who had to be tolerant to beg that alice who sat waiting on her would not stick up her shoulders in that frightful manner and that isabel instead of pushing up to her and asking questions would go away to miss merry
9777,248-130644-0007.flac,but her thoughts never dwelt on marriage as the fulfilment of her ambition the dramas in which she imagined herself a heroine were not wrought up to that close to be very much sued or hopelessly sighed for as a bride was indeed
9778,248-130644-0031.flac,that to look for any other would be to ask the reason of daylight when the sun is shining but beware of arriving at conclusions without comparison
9779,248-130644-0001.flac,why should he be expected to differ from his contemporaries in this matter and wish his niece a worse end of her charming maidenhood than they would approve as the best possible
9780,248-130644-0003.flac,in order that a marquis might fall in love with her or to have insisted that since a fair maiden was to be sought she should keep herself out of the way mister gascoine's calculations were of the kind called rational
9781,248-130644-0017.flac,in the school room her quick mind had taken readily that strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts which saves ignorance from any painful sense of limpness
9782,248-130644-0036.flac,we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment
9783,248-130644-0000.flac,it would be a little hard to blame the rector of pennicote that in the course of looking at things from every point of view he looked at gwendolen as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage
9784,248-130644-0018.flac,and what remained of all things knowable she was conscious of being sufficiently acquainted with through novels plays and poems about her french and music the two justifying accomplishments of a young lady she felt no ground for uneasiness
9785,248-130644-0016.flac,she felt well equipped for the mastery of life with regard to much in her lot hitherto she held herself rather hardly dealt with but as to her education she would have admitted that it had left her under no disadvantages
9786,248-130644-0005.flac,her uncle's intention fell in perfectly with gwendolen's own wishes but let no one suppose that she also contemplated a brilliant marriage as the direct end of her witching the world with her grace on horseback or with any other accomplishment
9787,248-130644-0033.flac,some of them were a very common sort of men and the only point of resemblance among them all was a strong determination to have what was pleasant with a total fearlessness in making themselves disagreeable or dangerous when they did not get it
9788,248-130644-0032.flac,whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful or euphonious way and who were not eldest daughters with a tender timid mother compunctious at having subjected them to inconveniences
9789,248-130644-0024.flac,if when they were under the stress of travelling she did not appear at the breakfast table till everyone else had finished the only question was how gwendolen's coffee and toast should still be of the hottest and crispest
9790,248-130644-0019.flac,and when to all these qualifications negative and positive we add the spontaneous sense of capability some happy persons are born with so that any subject they turn their attention to impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on it
9791,248-130644-0012.flac,her knowledge being such as with no sort of standing room or length of lever could have been expected to move the world she meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking manner
9792,248-130644-0023.flac,if the wood smoked in the bedroom fireplace missus davilow whose own weak eyes suffered much from this inconvenience spoke apologetically of it to gwendolen
9793,248-130644-0009.flac,in which a woman could not do what she liked had more children than were desirable was consequently dull and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum of course marriage was social promotion
9794,248-130644-0029.flac,there seemed to be a sudden sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life and even the waiters at hotels showed the more alacrity in doing away with crumbs and creases and dregs with struggling flies in them
9795,248-130644-0027.flac,how was this to be accounted for the answer may seem to lie quite on the surface in her beauty a certain unusualness about her
9796,248-130644-0008.flac,an indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power but to become a wife and wear all the domestic fetters of that condition was on the whole a vexatious necessity her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state
9797,248-130644-0013.flac,and have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in which no will was present it was not to be so with her she would no longer be sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself
9798,196-122150-0019.flac,how this one had an easy billet in japan somewhere and that one was doing well in the siamese navy and in all they said in their actions in their looks in their persons could be detected the soft spot the place of decay
9799,196-122150-0040.flac,held on her steadfast way black and smouldering in a luminous immensity as if scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity
9800,196-122150-0017.flac,had preserved an undefaced energy with the temper of buccaneers and the eyes of dreamers they appeared to live in a crazy maze of plans hopes dangers enterprises ahead of civilization in the dark places of the sea
9801,196-122150-0030.flac,the strong men at the head of family parties the lean old men pressing forward without hope of return young boys with fearless eyes glancing curiously shy little girls with tumbled long hair
9802,196-122150-0039.flac,such were the days still hot heavy disappearing one by one into the past as if falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake of the ship and the ship lonely under a wisp of smoke
9803,196-122150-0025.flac,and when clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck flowed forward an aft overflowed down the yawning hatchways filled the inner recesses of the ship like water filling a cistern
9804,196-122150-0032.flac,said the german skipper to his new chief mate an arab the leader of that pious voyage came last he walked slowly aboard handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban a string of servants followed loaded with his luggage
9805,196-122150-0028.flac,meeting strange sights beset by strange fears upheld by one desire they came from solitary huts in the wilderness from populouse campongs from villages by the sea at the call of an idea
9806,196-122150-0012.flac,played cards a little or yawning and in pyjamas lounged through the day in easy chairs without saying a word the hospital stood on a hill and a gentle breeze entering through the windows always flung wide open
9807,196-122150-0022.flac,she was owned by a chinaman chartered by an arab and commanded by a sort of renegade new south wales german very anxious to curse publicly his native country but who apparently on the strength of bismarc's victorious policy
9808,196-122150-0020.flac,the determination to lounge safely through existence to jim that gossiping crowd viewed as seamen seemed at first more unsubstantial than so many shadows but at length he found a fascination in the sight of those men
9809,196-122150-0004.flac,that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice with a strength beyond control with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and his fear
9810,196-122150-0018.flac,had remained as officers of country ships they had now a horror of the home service with its harder conditions severer view of duty and the hazard of stormy oceans they were attuned to the eternal peace of eastern sky and sea
9811,196-122150-0024.flac,they streamed aboard over three gangways they streamed in urged by faith an the hope of paradise they streamed in with a continuous tramp and shuffle of bare feet without a word a murmur or a look back
9812,196-122150-0038.flac,the awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern and a faint hum alow murmur of sad voices alone revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean
9813,196-122150-0016.flac,he associated naturally with the men of his calling in the port these were of two kinds some very few and seen there but seldom led mysterious lives
9814,196-122150-0006.flac,disabled by a falling spar at the beginning of a week of which his scottish captain used to say afterwards man it's a perfect miracle to me how she lived through it spent many days stretched on his back dazed battered hopeless
9815,196-122150-0015.flac,lighted by festal sunshine its ships like toys its brilliant activity resembling a holiday pageant with the eternal serenity of the eastern sky overhead and the smiling peace of the eastern seas
9816,196-122150-0011.flac,afflicted by some mysterious tropical disease who held the doctor for an ass and indulged in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which his tamil servant used to smuggle in with unwearied devotion they told each other the story of their lives
9817,196-122150-0007.flac,and tormented as if at the bottom of an abyss of unrest he did not care what the end would be and in his lucid moments overvalued his indifference the danger when not seen has the imperfect vagueness of human thought
9818,196-122150-0026.flac,like water flowing into crevices and crannies like water rising silently even with the rim eight hundred men and women with faith and hopes with affections and memories they had collected there
9819,196-122150-0029.flac,they had left their forests their clearings the protection of their rulers their prosperity their poverty the surroundings of their youth and the graves of their fathers they came covered with dust with sweat with grime with rags
9820,196-122150-0001.flac,he knew the magic monotony of existence between sky and water he had to bear the criticism of men the exactions of the sea and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread but whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work
9821,196-122150-0002.flac,the edge of his temper and the fibre of his stuff that reveal the quality of his resistance and the secret truth of his pretences not only to others but also to himself
9822,196-122150-0034.flac,its eye of flame as if in derision of her errand of faith she cleared the strait crossed the bay continued on her way through the one degree passage she held on straight for the red sea under a serene sky
9823,196-122150-0031.flac,the timid women muffled up and clasping to their breasts wrapped in loose end of soiled headcloths their sleeping babies the unconscious pilgrims of an exacting belief
9824,196-122150-0037.flac,glided past on his descent and sank mysteriously into the sea evening after evening preserving the same distance ahead of her advancing bows the five whites on board lived amidships isolated from the human cargo
9825,196-122150-0003.flac,there are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intention that indefinable something which forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man
9826,196-122150-0021.flac,in their appearance of doing so well on such a small allowance of danger and toil in time beside the original disdain there grew up slowly another sentiment and suddenly giving up the idea of going home
9827,196-122150-0023.flac,brutalized all those he was not afraid of and wore a blood and iron air combined with a purple nose and a red moustache after she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside eight hundred pilgrims more or less
9828,196-122150-0000.flac,chapter two after two years of training he went to sea and entering the region so well known to his imagination found them strangely barren of adventure he made many voyages
9829,196-122150-0035.flac,enveloped in a fulgar of sunshine that killed all thought oppressed the heart withered all impulses of strength and energy and under the sinister splendor of that sky the sea blue and profound remained still without a stir
9830,196-122150-0027.flac,coming from north and south and from the outskirts of the east after treading the jungle paths descending the rivers coasting in prows along the shallows crossing in small canoes from island to island passing through suffering
9831,196-122150-0033.flac,and on the secret purposes of their hearts the steamer pounded in the dusk the calm water of the strait and far astern of the pilgrim ship a screwpile lighthouse planted by unbelievers on a treacherous shoal seemed to wink at her
9832,196-122150-0009.flac,and then the unintelligent brutality of an existence liable to the agony of such sensations filled him with a despairing desire to escape at any cost then fine weather returned and he thought no more about it
9833,196-122150-0036.flac,without a ripple without a wrinkle viscous stagnant dead the patna with a slight hiss passed over that plain luminous and smooth unrolled a black ribbon of smoke across the sky
9834,196-122150-0010.flac,his lameness however persisted and when the ship arrived at an eastern port he had to go to the hospital his recovery was slow and he was left behind
9835,196-122150-0014.flac,jim looked every day over the thickets of gardens beyond the roofs of the town over the fronds of palms growing on the shore at that roadstead which is a thoroughfare to the east at the roadstead dotted by garlanded islets
9836,196-122150-0005.flac,the sunshine the memories the future which means to sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by the simple and appalling act of taking his life jim
9837,196-122150-0008.flac,he lay there battened down in the midst of a small devastation and felt secretly glad he had not to go on deck but now and again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip him bodily
9838,196-122150-0013.flac,brought into the bare room the softness of the sky the languor of the earth the bewitching breath of the eastern waters there were perfumes in it suggestions of infinite repose the gift of endless dreams
9839,196-122159-0003.flac,of the sort you like to imagine yourself to have been of the sort whose appearance claims the fellowship of these illusions you had thought gone out extinct cold and which as if rekindled at the approach of another flame
9840,196-122159-0029.flac,i wanted it it is the very thing i wanted there do you think you or anybody could have made me if i i am i am not afraid to tell and i wasn't afraid to think either i looked it in the face
9841,196-122159-0024.flac,a hair's breadth he muttered not the breadth of a hair between this and that and at the time it is difficult to see a hair at midnight i put in
9842,196-122159-0026.flac,keep up the illusion of my beginnings as though he had robbed our common life of the last spark of its glamour and so you cleared out at once jumped he corrected me incisively jumped mind
9843,196-122159-0007.flac,glitter of the vast surface which is only a reflection of his own glances full of fire there is such a magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had driven each of us to the sea such a glorious indefiniteness
9844,196-122159-0010.flac,hadn't we all commenced with the same desire ended with the same knowledge ceried the memory of the same cherished glamour through the sordid days of imprecation what wonder that when some
9845,196-122159-0019.flac,i interjected i would have meant to be he retorted and that's more than i meant when i he shivered as if about to swallow some nauseous drug jumped
9846,196-122159-0017.flac,how much more did you want i asked but i think i spoke so low that he did not catch what i said he had advanced his argument as though life had been a network of
9847,196-122159-0023.flac,men have been known to float for hours in the open sea and be picked up not much the worst for it i might have lasted it out better than many others there's nothing the matter with my heart
9848,196-122159-0002.flac,like this he said it does me good you don't know what it is to me you don't words seemed to fail him it was a distinct glimpse he was a youngster of the sort you like to see about you
9849,196-122159-0022.flac,now you understand why i didn't after all didn't go out in that way i wasn't going to be frightened at what i had done and anyhow if i had stuck to this ship i would have done my best to be saved
9850,196-122159-0018.flac,his voice sounded reasonable suppose i had not i mean to say suppose i had stuck to the ship well how much longer say a minute half a minute
9851,196-122159-0021.flac,i ought to have known i am i am a gentleman too yes yes i said hastily he was looking me squarely in the face and withdrew his gaze slowly
9852,196-122159-0009.flac,in no other kind of life is the illusion more wide of reality in no other is the beginning all illusion the disenchantment more swift the subjugation more complete
9853,196-122159-0004.flac,you don't know what it is for a fellow in my position to be believed make a clean breast of it to an elder man it is so difficult so awfully unfair so hard to understand
9854,196-122159-0015.flac,and was placated by the sound of a faint sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird in the night well i wasn't he said courageously it was something like that wretched story they made up it was not a lie
9855,196-122159-0000.flac,at his back was the dark night with the clear stars whose distant glitter disposed in retreating planes lured the eye into the depths of a greater darkness
9856,196-122159-0001.flac,and yet a mysterious light seemed to show me his boyish head as if in that moment the youth within him had for a moment glowed and expired you are an awful good sort to listen
9857,196-122159-0031.flac,but i knew the truth and i would live it down alone with myself i wasn't going to give in to such a beastly unfair thing what did it prove after all i was confoundedly cut up sick of life

9883,196-122152-0001.flac,and the official inquiry was being held in the police court of an eastern port he stood elevated in the witness box with burning cheeks in a cool lofty room
9884,196-122152-0017.flac,the facts those men were so eager to know had been visible tangible open to the senses occupying their place in space and time requiring for their existence a fourteen hundred ton steamer
9885,196-122152-0022.flac,the magistrate had swayed forward
9886,196-122152-0004.flac,for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast came to him poignant and silent
9887,196-122152-0005.flac,outside the court the sun blazed within was the wind of great punkahs that made you shiver the shame that made you burn the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed the face of the presiding magistrate
9888,196-122152-0013.flac,he did not strike him again he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low

9890,196-122152-0029.flac,like a prisoner alone in his cell or like a wayfarer lost in a wilderness at present he was answering questions that did not matter though they had a purpose but he doubted whether he would ever again speak out as long as he lived
9891,196-122152-0002.flac,the big framework of punkahs moved gently to and fro high above his head and from below many eyes were looking at him out of dark faces out of white faces out of red faces out of faces attentive spell bound
9892,196-122152-0027.flac,it was an act of intelligent volition jim between two questions forgot himself so far as to find leisure for a thought this fellow ran the thought looks at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder
9893,196-122152-0026.flac,what's the good of this what's the good he tapped with his foot slightly bit his lip and looked away over the heads he met the eyes of the white man the glance directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others
9894,196-122152-0024.flac,and in drill suits that seemed to fit them as close as their skins and holding their round pith hats on their knees while gliding along the walls the court pians buttoned tight in long white coats flitted rapidly to and fro
9895,196-122152-0028.flac,he had come across that man before in the street perhaps he was positive he had never spoken to him for days for many days he had spoken to no one but had held silent incoherent an endless converse with himself

9902,196-122152-0019.flac,and fortunately he remembered everything he wanted to go on talking for truth's sake perhaps for his own sake also and while his utterance was deliberate his mind positively flew round and round the sarried circle of facts
9903,196-122152-0020.flac,he seemed calm enough only he stumbled several times and once as i stood speaking to him he walked right into me as though he had been stone blind he made no definite answer to what i had to tell
9904,196-122152-0009.flac,i was told to call no one and to make no noise for fear of creating a panic i thought the precaution reasonable i took one of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward after opening the fore peak hatch i heard splashing in there
9905,196-122152-0015.flac,which was on the port's side he moaned as he ran he spoke slowly he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness he could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the better information of these men

9994,2002-139469-0076.flac,the blow was struck the aristocracy obtained all they wished and they subscribed to a twelvemonth's bill which levied twenty per cent on all the rent rolls of the country
9995,2002-139469-0008.flac,the clouds become thin and arc is formed for ever rising upwards till the universal cope being unveiled the sun pours forth its rays reanimated and fed by the breeze
9996,2002-139469-0072.flac,and these were his vowed enemies he must conciliate them by abandoning his favorite scheme of equalization he must confirm them
9997,2002-139469-0013.flac,they flourish nursed by thee why dost thou howl thus o wind by day and by night for four long months thy roarings have not ceased the shores of the sea are strewn with wrecks
9998,2002-139469-0009.flac,then mighty art thou a wind to be throned above all
9999,2002-139469-0001.flac,and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience the god sends down his angry plagues from high famine and pestilence in heaps they die again in vengeance of his wrath he falls
10000,2002-139469-0003.flac,their deadly power shook the flourishing countries of the south and during winter even we in our northern retreat began to quake under their ill effects
10001,2002-139469-0059.flac,perchanced some stricken asiatic
10002,2002-139469-0069.flac,and the cape of good hope plague raged
10003,2002-139469-0040.flac,we must quake she could take out our globe
10004,2002-139469-0005.flac,and ungenial when the sleeping wind has awoke in the east or when the dun clouds thickly veil the sky
10005,5463-39174-0043.flac,if i could only do something for my poor grace in answer to this missus robarts said a word or two but not much she resolved however that if she could get her husband's leave something should be done for grace
10006,5463-39174-0000.flac,at the end of the last chapter we left lucy robarts waiting for an introduction to missus crawley who was sitting with one baby in her lap while she was rocking another who lay in a cradle at her feet mister crawley in the meanwhile had risen from his seat with his finger between the leaves of an old grammar
10007,5463-39174-0022.flac,lucy found it very difficult to keep up a conversation with mister crawley the more so as missus robarts and missus crawley presently withdrew into a bedroom taking the two younger children with them how unlucky thought lucy that she has not got my muff with her
10008,5463-39174-0030.flac,had been attracted by the sound of sugar plums in spite of the irregular verbs and lucy withdrew her hand from her muff and looked guilty was she not deceiving the good man nay teaching his own children to deceive him
10009,5463-39174-0017.flac,oh certainly bob my child
10010,5463-39174-0008.flac,that horace and the irregular greek verbes savoured too much of precocious forcing in a young lady of nine years old but nevertheless grace was a pretty simple looking girl and clung to her ally closely and seemed to like being fondled
10011,5463-39174-0039.flac,oh no i could not punish you for your goodness in that way but he would not go he could go and leave me at home sometimes i have thought that it might be so and i have done all in my power to persuade him i have told him that if he could mix once more with the world with the clerical world you know
10012,5463-39174-0002.flac,the realities of life had become so stern to her that the outward aspects of them were as nothing she would have liked a new gown because it would have been useful but it would have been nothing to her if all the county knew that the one in which she went to church had been turned three times
10013,5463-39174-0026.flac,whispered into his ear that he was wanted it was the time of day at which his attendance was always required in his parish school and that attendance being so punctually given those who wanted him looked for him there at this hour and if he were absent did not scruple to send for him
10014,5463-39174-0031.flac,but there are men made of such stuff that an angel could hardly live with them without some deceit papa's gone now whispered bobby i saw him turn round the corner he at any rate had learned his lesson as it was natural that he should do
10015,5463-39174-0015.flac,what is that bob said mister crawley gingerbread faltered bobby feeling that a sin had been committed though probably feeling also that he himself could hardly as yet be accounted as deeply guilty miss robarts said the father we are very much obliged to you
10016,5463-39174-0049.flac,how false is his pride and how false is shame but we must remember what he has to bear it is not every one that can endure such a life as his without false pride and false shame but she has neither said lucy
10017,5463-39174-0027.flac,miss robarts i am afraid you must excuse me said he getting up and taking his hat and stick lucy begged that she might not be at all in the way and already began to speculate how she might best unload her treasures
10018,5463-39174-0019.flac,this was very discouraging to lucy if one small bag of gingerbread nuts created so great a difficulty how was she to dispose of the pod of guava jelly and box of bombonds which were still in her muff or how distribute the packet of oranges with which the pony carriage was laden
10019,5463-39174-0046.flac,and moreover the gingerbread had been taken down in the audacity of their commercial speculations and the nuts were spread out upon a board behind which lucy stood as shop girl disposing of them for kisses mamma mamma said bobby running up to his mother you must buy something of her
10020,5463-39174-0028.flac,and then stick in hand he walked forth and lucy fancied that bobby's eyes immediately rested on the bag of gingerbread nuts bob said she almost in a whisper
10021,5463-39174-0044.flac,and was it not incumbent upon her to make some kindly use of all the goods with which providence had blessed herself and then they went back to the sitting room each again with a young child in her arms
10022,5463-39174-0003.flac,it galled him however to think that he and his were so poorly dressed i am afraid you can hardly find a chair miss robarts said mister crawley
10023,5463-39174-0016.flac,but our children are hardly used to such things
10024,5463-39174-0012.flac,looking up for a moment from the anxious discussion in which she was already engaged with missus crawley on nursery matters pray tell him said mister crawley that i shall be happy to see him
10025,5463-39174-0040.flac,that he would be better fitted for the performance of his own duties but he answers me angrily that it is impossible that his coat is not fit for the dean's table and missus crawley almost blushed as she spoke of such a reason what with an old friend like doctor arabin
10026,5463-39174-0013.flac,his new duties do not disturb him much as yet said lucy and his riding over here will be no trouble to him yes there he has the advantage over me i unfortunately have no horse
10027,5463-39174-0047.flac,and he pointed with his fingers at the shop girl you must give her two kisses for that heap of barley sugar looking at bobby's mouth at the time one would have said that his kisses might be dispensed with when they were again in the pony carriage behind the impatient puck and were well away from the door
10028,5463-39174-0020.flac,and there was jelly for the sick child and chicken broth which was indeed another jelly and to tell the truth openly there was also a joint of fresh pork and a basket of eggs from the famly parsonage farmyard which missus robarts was to introduce should she find herself capable of doing so
10029,5463-39174-0025.flac,it was on lucy's tongue to say that her ladyship was pretty nearly as bad but she stopped herself at this moment providence sent great relief to miss robarts in the shape of missus crawley's red armed maid of all work who walking up to her master
10030,5463-39174-0024.flac,mark thinks that as he is so near he need not be much absent from frameley even during his residence and then lady lufton is so good about the schools ah yes but lady lufton is not a clergyman miss robarts
10031,5463-39174-0010.flac,yes i have heard of it said mister crawley gravely i hope that his promotion may tend in every way to his advantage here and hereafter it seemed however to be manifest from the manner in which he expressed his kind wishes
10032,5463-39174-0045.flac,lucy had been engaged the while with the children and when the two married ladies entered they found that a shop had been opened at which all manner of luxuries were being readily sold and purchased at marvellously easy prices the guava jelly was there and the oranges and the sugar plums red and yellow and striped
10033,5463-39174-0033.flac,i did venture to bring them said fanny with a look of shame for i know how a sick child occupies the whole house ah my friend said missus crawley taking hold of missus robarts arm and looking into her face that sort of shame is over with me
10034,5463-39174-0014.flac,and then lucy began petting the little boy and by degrees slipped a small bag of gingerbread nuts out of her muff into his hands she had not the patience necessary for waiting as had her sister in law the boy took the bag peeped into it and then looked up into her face
10035,5463-39174-0042.flac,but such a friend must be equal not only in mind but in purse and where can he ever find such a man as that but you may get better preferment ah no and if he did we are hardly fit for it now if i could think that i could educate my children
10036,5463-39174-0029.flac,i have left a book behind me he said and coming back through the room he took up the well worn prayer book which accompanied him in all his wanderings through the parish bobby when he saw his father had retreated a few steps back as also did grace who to confess the truth
10037,5463-39174-0011.flac,that his hopes and expectations did not go hand in hand together by the by he desired us to say that he will call here to morrow at about eleven didn't he say fanny yes
10038,5463-39174-0035.flac,such things are so much worse for a man than for a woman fanny was not quite prepared to admit this in her own heart but she made no reply on that head i am sure i hope we may be able to be of use to you she said if you will only look upon me as an old friend and write to me if you want me
10039,5463-39174-0036.flac,to feel herself so different from the wives of other clergymen around her to know that they lived softly while she with all the work of her hands and unceasing struggle of her energies could hardly manage to place wholesome food before her husband and children it was a terrible thing a grievous thing to think of
10040,5463-39174-0018.flac,and then the bag in a solemn manner was carried over to their mother who taking it from her son's hand laid it high on a bookshelf and not one now said lucy robarts very piteously don't be so hard mister crawley not upon them but upon me
10041,5463-39174-0001.flac,for she had work of this kind of her own at home which she by no means neglected though the attendance of nurses was more plentiful with her than at hogglestock missus crawley did get up and told lucy that she was glad to see her and mister crawley came forward grammar in hand looking humble and meek
10042,5463-39174-0032.flac,some one else also had learned that papa was gone for while bob and grace were still counting the big lumps of sugar candy each employed the while for inward solace with an inch of barley sugar the front door opened and a big basket and a bundle done up in a kitchen cloth
10043,5463-39174-0034.flac,god has tried us with want and for my children's sake i am glad of such relief but will he be angry i will manage it dear missus robarts you must not be surprised at him his lot is sometimes very hard to bear
10044,5463-39174-0005.flac,and are you a great scholar asked lucy drawing the child to her i don't know said grace with a sheepish face i am in greek delectus and the irregular verbs greek delectus and the irregular verbs and lucy put up her hands with astonishment
10045,5463-39174-0006.flac,and she knows an ode of horace all by heart said bob an ode of horace said lucy still holding the young shamefaced female progigy close to her knees it is all that i can give them said mister crawley apologetically
10046,5463-39174-0023.flac,but the muff lay in her lap ponderous with its rich enclosures i suppose you will live in barchester for a portion of the year now said mister crawley i really do not know as yet mark talks of taking lodgings for his first month's residence
10047,5463-39174-0048.flac,fanny was the first to speak how very different those two are she said different in their minds and in their spirit but how much higher toned is her mind than his how weak he is in many things and how strong she is in everything
10048,5463-39174-0041.flac,but what can i do i fear that he regards the rich as his enemies he is pining for the solace of some friend to whom he could talk for some equal with a mind educated like his own to whose thoughts he could listen and to whom he could speak his own thoughts
10049,5463-39174-0037.flac,that all the work of her mind should be given up to such subjects as these but nevertheless she could bear it she said as long as he would carry himself like a man and face his lot boldly before the world and then she told how he had been better there at hogglestock than in their former residence down in cornwall
10050,5463-39174-0038.flac,missus arabin told me that she was so anxious you should go to them said missus robarts ah yes but that i fear is impossible the children you know missus robarts
10051,5463-39174-0050.flac,because you have one hero in a family does that give you a right to expect another said missus robarts of all my own acquaintance missus crawley i think comes nearest to heroism and then they passed by the hogglestock school and mister crawley when he heard the noise of the wheels came out
10052,5463-39174-0007.flac,a little scholarship is the only fortune that has come in my way and i endeavour to share that with my children i believe men say that it is the best fortune any of us can have said lucy thinking however in her own mind
10053,5463-39174-0009.flac,so that lucy anxiously wished that mister crawley could be got rid of in the presents produced i hope you have left mister robarts quite well said mister crawley with a stiff ceremonial voice
10054,5463-39174-0004.flac,moving a pile of ragged coverless books on to the table i hope he'll forgive me for moving them they're not bobs at least not the most of them but mine said the girl but some of them are mine said the boy ain't they grace
10055,5463-39174-0021.flac,but which would certainly be cast out with utter scorn by mister crawley if tendered in his immediate presence there had also been a suggestion as to adding two or three bottles of port but the courage of the ladies had failed them on that head and the wine was not now added to their difficulties
10056,5463-39173-0030.flac,the mistress of such a destiny what more or what better could the world have done for her and now she had thrown all that aside because she would not endure that lady lufton should call her a scheming artful girl actuated by that fear she had repulsed him with a falsehood
10057,5463-39173-0051.flac,therefore i shall not be satisfied if they become man and wife however
10058,5463-39173-0026.flac,but what would the world come to if none but absolute true heroes were to be thought worthy of women's love what would the men do and what oh what would become of the women
10059,5463-39173-0034.flac,we are going to drive over to hogglestock this morning fanny said one day at breakfast i suppose mark you won't go with us
10060,5463-39173-0059.flac,lucy had never seen missus crawley these visits to hogglestock were not frequent and had generally been made by lady lufton and missus robarts together
10061,5463-39173-0055.flac,and the scanty comfort of their improved though still wretched income had done something towards bringing her back to the world in which she had lived in the soft days of her childhood but even the liberal stipend of a hundred and thirty pounds a year
10062,5463-39173-0046.flac,there is i believe nothing in her mentally whatever may be her moral excellences to me she is more absolutely like a statue than any other human being i ever saw to sit still and be admired is all that she desires and if she cannot get that
10063,5463-39173-0056.flac,liberal according to the scale by which the incomes of clergymen and some of our new districts are now apportioned would not admit of a gentleman with his wife and four children living with the ordinary comforts of an artisan's family
10064,5463-39173-0010.flac,i suppose i shall have to go into residence almost immediately said mark recurring to the more agreeable subject of the stall
10065,5463-39173-0008.flac,and that the purchasing of a hunter with a view of immediately selling him again was to say the least of it an operation hardly congenial with the usual tastes and pursuits of a clergyman i hope you did not give very much money for him mark said fanny
10066,5463-39173-0014.flac,it was now the month of april and the fields were beginning to look green and the wind had got itself out of the east and was soft and genial and the early spring flowers were showing their bright colours in the parsonage garden and all things were sweet and pleasant
10067,5463-39173-0016.flac,atoning to his own conscience for past shortcomings by present zeal and then though she had never acknowledged it to herself the absence of her dear friend lady lufton was perhaps in itself not disagreeable missus robarts did love lady lufton heartily
10068,5463-39173-0037.flac,well lucy we must drive ourselves that's all you shall be chariotor going and then we'll change coming back to all which lucy agreed and as soon as their work in the school was over they started
10069,5463-39173-0043.flac,whether lord lufton likes her i think he does in a sort of way he did not talk to her so much as he did to you ah that was all lady lufton's fault because she didn't have him properly labelled
10070,5463-39173-0049.flac,if he were your brother you could not be more eager about it no i could not he's the only man friend with whom i was ever intimate and i cannot bear to think that he should throw himself away it's horridly improper to care about such a thing i have no doubt
10071,5463-39173-0039.flac,as to make her sister in law quite sure that there had been no love passages up to that time and nothing had since occurred which had created any suspicion in missus robart's mind she had seen at once that all the close intimacy between them was over and thought that everything was as it should be
10072,5463-39173-0001.flac,indeed after what mister sowerby had said and after lord lufton's assent to it it would have been madness he considered to decline it and then too mister sowerby's promise about the bills was very comfortable to him after all
10073,5463-39173-0060.flac,almost as penilous as the curate himself then they would walk together for hours along the rock bound shore listening to the waves discussing deep polemical mysteries sometimes with hot fury then again with tender loving charity
10074,5463-39173-0038.flac,not a word had been spoken between them about lord lufton since that evening now more than a month ago on which they had been walking together in the garden lucy had so demeaned herself on that occasion
10075,5463-39173-0058.flac,as for her own raiment the wives of few artisans would have been content to put up with missus crawley's best gown the stuff of which it was made had been paid for by her mother when she with much difficulty bestow ed upon her daughter her modest wedding trousseau
10076,5463-39173-0029.flac,but a title and an estate and an income are matters which will weigh in the balance with all eve's daughters as they do with all adam's sons pride of place and the power of living well in front of the world's eye are dear to us all are doubtless intended to be dear
10077,5463-39173-0004.flac,the enjoyment of one's own happiness at such windfalls depends so much on the free and freely expressed enjoyment of others lady lufton's congratulations had nearly made him throw up the whole thing but his wife's smiles re encouraged him
10078,5463-39173-0031.flac,though the matter was one on which it was so terribly expedient that she should tell the truth and yet she was cheerful with her brother and sister in law
10079,5463-39173-0020.flac,haste and superhuman efforts and men running to and fro with blank acceptances in their hands could alone stave off the crack of doom but at other times when retaliatory applications were made to him
10080,5463-39173-0022.flac,mark could not bring himself to say that he would pay nothing till the bills were safe and therefore with the assistance of mister forrest of the bank he did remit the price of dandy to his friend sewerby in london and lucy robarts
10081,5463-39173-0011.flac,the house will not be furnished will at mark said his wife i don't know how we shall get on don't frighten yourselves i shall take lodgings in barchester and we shall not see you all the time said missus robarts with dismay
10082,5463-39173-0048.flac,but i shall indeed be surprised if he wishes it also and then as she finished her speech lucy again flogged the pony this she did in vexation because she felt that the tell tale blood had suffused her face why lucy
10083,5463-39173-0012.flac,but the prebyndary explained that he would be backwards and forwards at frameley every week and that in all probability he would only sleep at barchester on the saturdays and sundays and perhaps not always then
10084,5463-39173-0003.flac,the income was already his own
10085,5463-39173-0018.flac,dandy was rather a thorn in his side those wretched bills were to come due early in may and before the end of april soerby wrote to him saying that he was doing his utmost to provide for the evil day
10086,5463-39173-0050.flac,i shall not be satisfied it's no use your looking at me fanny you will make me talk of it and i won't tell a lie on the subject i do like lord lufton very much and i do dislike griselda grantly almost as much
10087,5463-39173-0035.flac,the pony carriage is wretched for three oh as for that i should have thought the new horse might have been able to carry you as far as that i heard you say you wanted to see mister crawley so i do and the new horse as you call him shall carry me there to morrow
10088,5463-39173-0036.flac,will you say that i'll be over about twelve o'clock you had better say earlier as he is always out about the parish very well say eleven it is parish business about which i am going so it need not irk his conscience to stay in for me
10089,5463-39173-0013.flac,the worst of it is that both of them are obliged to wear wigs shall you have a hat mark with curly things at the side and strings through to hold them up asked lucy i fear that does not come with my perquisites nor rosette
10090,5463-39173-0047.flac,to sit still and not be admired would almost suffice for her i do not worship lady lufton as you do but i think quite well enough of her to wonder that she should choose such a girl as that for her son's wife that she does wish it i do not doubt
10091,5463-39173-0000.flac,chapter twenty one why puck the pony was beaten mark robarts returned home the day after the scene at the albany considerably relieved in spirit
10092,5463-39173-0025.flac,i know it will be said of lord lufton himself that putting aside his peerage and broad acres and handsome sonsy face he was not worth a girl's care and love
10093,5463-39173-0033.flac,in all her employments in her ways about the house and her accustomed quiet mirth she was the same as ever in this she showed the peculiar strength which god had given her but not the less did she in truth mourn for her lost love and spoiled ambition
10094,5463-39173-0023.flac,she had declared to him plainly that she did not love him and could not love him and had thus thrown away not only riches and honour and high station but more than that much worse than that she had flung away from her the lover to whose love her warm heart clung
10095,5463-39173-0027.flac,lucy robarts in her heart did not give her dismissed lover credit for much more heroism than did truly appertain to him did not perhaps give him full credit for a certain amount of heroism which did really appertain to him
10096,5463-39173-0019.flac,but that if the price of dandy could be remitted to him at once it would greatly facilitate his object nothing could be more different than mister sowerby's tone about money at different times when he wanted to raise the wind everything was so important
10097,5463-39173-0052.flac,there was then nothing more said on the subject and in two minutes they arrived at the house of the hogglestock clergyman missus crawley had brought two children with her when she came from the cornish curacy to hogglestock and two other babies had been added to her care since then
10098,5463-39173-0053.flac,one of these was now ill with croup and it was with the object of offering to the mother some comfort and solace that the present visit was made the two ladies got down from the carriage having obtained the services of a boy to hold puck and soon found themselves in missus crawley's single sitting room
10099,5463-39173-0007.flac,neither of the two ladies at famley parsonage knew much about horses or of the manner in which one gentleman might think it proper to oblige another by purchasing the superfluities of his stable but they did both feel that there were horses enough in the parsonage stable without dandy
10100,5463-39173-0042.flac,and then she is quiet and reserved she does not require excitement and i am sure is conscientious in the performance of her duties very conscientious i have no doubt said lucy with something like a sneer in her tone but the question i suppose is
10101,5463-39173-0015.flac,went away when the spring came leaving their houses innocent and empty the parish duty was better attended to and perhaps domestic duties also at such period he was a pattern parson and a pattern husband
10102,5463-39173-0024.flac,that her love did cling to him she knew even then and owned more thoroughly as soon as he was gone so much her pride had done for her and that strong resolve that lady lufton should not scowl on her and tell her that she had entrapped her son
10103,5463-39173-0021.flac,he could prove with the easiest voice and most jaunty manner that everything was quite serene now at this period he was in that mood of superhuman efforts and he called loudly for the hundred and thirty pounds for dandy after what had passed
10104,5463-39173-0032.flac,it was when she was quite alone at night in her own room or in her solitary walks that a single silent tear would gather in the corner of her eye and gradually moisten her eyelids she never told her love nor did she allow concealment to feed on her damask cheek
10105,5463-39173-0006.flac,which he had bought from mister sowerby some little time since with the object of obliging him he mark intended to sell him again as soon as he could do so judiciously this as i have said above was not satisfactory
10106,5463-39173-0062.flac,and doctor arabin had promised that no one else should be in the house if mister crawley objected to society but this was not what he wanted the finery and grandeur of the deanery and the comfort of that warm snug library would silence him at once
10107,5463-39173-0040.flac,but she did not betray herself perhaps we may she said and then gave the pony a little touch with her whip oh lucy i won't have puck beaten he was going very nicely i beg puck's pardon
10108,5463-39173-0017.flac,indeed just at this moment
10109,5463-39173-0009.flac,not more than i shall get again said mark
10110,5463-39173-0061.flac,but always with a mutual acknowledgment of each other's truth now they lived comparatively near together but no opportunities arose for such discussions at any rate once a quarter mister crawley was pressed by his old friend to visit him at the deanery
10111,5463-39173-0063.flac,then old days would have come back to them but now arabin always rides on a sleek fine horse nowadays he once said to his wife with a sneer
10112,5463-39173-0045.flac,then i really do think that he his uncommon bad taste said lucy with the reality in her voice differing much from the tone of banter she had hitherto used what lucy said her sister in law looking at her
10113,5463-39173-0005.flac,and lucy's warm and eager joy made him feel quite delighted with mister sowerby and the duke of omnium and then that splendid animal dandy came home to the parsonage stables much to the delight of the groom and gardener
10114,5463-39173-0054.flac,which they knew it would be impossible to introduce in mister crawley's presence she as we have said was not quite so gaunt not altogether so haggard as in the latter of those dreadful cornish days lady lufton and missus arabin between them
10115,5463-39173-0057.flac,as regards the mere eating and drinking the amounts of butcher's meat and tea and butter they of course were used in quantities which any artisan would have regarded as compatible only with demi starvation better clothing for her children was necessary and better clothing for him
10116,5463-39173-0041.flac,but you see when one is trusted with a whip one feels such a longing to use it oh but you should keep it still i feel almost certain that lady lufton would like such a match i dare say she might miss grantly will have a large fortune i believe
10117,5463-39173-0002.flac,on the day after his return he received proper authentic tidings of his presentation to the preband he was in fact already prebandary
10118,5463-39173-0044.flac,oh by god's mercy very little as for me i shall get over it in three or four years i don't doubt that's if i can get ass's milk and change of air we'll take you to barchester for that but as i was saying i really do think lord lufton likes griselda grantly
10119,5463-39173-0028.flac,treats herself as a farmer treats as sheep and oxen makes hardly more of herself of her own inner self in which are comprised a mind and a soul than the poor wretch of her own sex who earns her bread in the lowest stage of degradation
10120,8123-275193-0025.flac,and a cuticle that showed unmistakable evidence of scurvy for the first he was put upon short rations for the second sand baths on shore were prescribed
10121,8123-275193-0016.flac,possibly however rather more intelligent than the average canine pet the fourth of july eighteen sixty two was a gala day at roanoke island
10122,8123-275193-0018.flac,more than to his heart's content and then patriotically decorated in his right ear was a red ribbon in his left a white one around his neck another of blue
10123,8123-275193-0020.flac,his reward for this unusual demonstration was instantaneous and consisted of some apples and a toothsome dessert of sugar afterward he made the round of the camps with a special escort of warrant officers and devoted jack tars
10124,8123-275193-0019.flac,thus adorned he was brought on shore to pay me a visit and as he came through my door he appeared to be filled with the pride of patriotism and a realization of the greatness of the occasion
10125,8123-275193-0024.flac,it was his habit to go from one four castle mests to another and to insist upon having rather more than his share of the choice morsels from each in a short time he came to the repair shop very much the worse for wear with an impaired digestion
10126,8123-275193-0026.flac,under this treatment poor jeff lost all his buoyancy of spirits and his habitual friskiness and became sad and dejected but bore his troubles with patience he took to the sand baths at once
10127,8123-275193-0023.flac,jeff was a confirmed lover of good eating and in time paid the usual penalty for over indulgence of his very piggish appetite while the meal pennant was up
10128,8123-275193-0022.flac,hogs of this particular kind are famous snake killers a big rattler or a garter snake is all the same to them they advanced to the attack with the greatest impetuosity and a feast upon snake is the usual reward of exceptional bravery
10129,8123-275193-0017.flac,was made more glorious by the exchange of camp hospitalities and an indulgence in such simple hilarity as the occasion seemed to require but jeff was not forgotten early in the morning he was bathed and scrubbed
10130,8123-275193-0013.flac,was playful good natured and expressed pleasure pain anger and desire with various squeals and grunts delivered with a variety of intonations that were very easily interpreted
10131,8123-275193-0021.flac,he was seen after he had run a few yards to make a great jump and then remain in his tracks the pursuing party found him actively engaged in demolishing a moccasin which he had crushed by jumping and landing with his feet upon its head and back
10132,8123-275193-0027.flac,and gave forth many disgruntled grunts when lifted out of them the last time i saw jeff in eighteen sixty two he was buried up to his ears in the cool sands of the ronoke island shore with eyes upturned and looking like a very sad pig
10133,8123-275193-0015.flac,when on shore he followed his favorites like a dog and was never known to root except in speech and appearance he was the counterpart of a happy good natured and well cared for household dog
10134,8123-275193-0014.flac,he was never so happy as when in the lap of one of the sailors having his back stroked his pleasure upon those occasions was evinced by the emission of frequent good natured grunts and looking up into the face of the friendly stroker
10135,8123-275193-0011.flac,and seemingly was deeply interested in the event it may be said of him generally that he was overflowing with spirits and took an actif interest in all the daily routine work of his ship
10136,8123-275193-0001.flac,which composed what commodore goldsborough designated his pasteboard fleet was the louisiana commanded by commander alexander murray who was noted for his efficiency and good nature his treatment of his crew
10137,8123-275193-0003.flac,he was a perfectly black pig of the racer razorback order which at that time were plentiful in the coast sections of the more southern of the slave holding states they were called racers
10138,8123-275193-0008.flac,he attached himself to each individual of the ship he had no favorites but was hail fellow well met with all he developed all the playful qualities of a puppy and reasoned out a number of problems in his own way
10139,8123-275193-0009.flac,his particular admirers declared that he learned the meaning of the different whistles of the boat swain that he knew when the meal pennant was hoisted to the peak could tell when the crew was beat to quarters for drill
10140,8123-275193-0006.flac,the doctor was consulted and after a careful diagnosis decided there was no organic disease want of parental care want of nourishment and exposure were held responsible for jeff's unfavorable condition
10141,8123-275193-0012.flac,in the gradual development of jeff's character it was discovered that he had none of the usual well known traits of the pig he was more like a petted and pampered dog
10142,8123-275193-0010.flac,in this act of courtesy he is always accompanied by the officer of the deck and often by others that may happen to be at hand after the advent of jeff whenever i went on board the louisiana he was always at the gangway
10143,8123-275193-0000.flac,jeff the inquisitive by general rush c hawkins among the gun boats doing duty on the inland waters of north carolina in the early spring of eighteen sixty two
10144,8123-275193-0004.flac,because of their long legs slender bodies and great capacity for running and razor backs on account of the prominence of the spinal column the origin of this particular species of the porcein tribe is unknown but there is a tradition to the effect
10145,8123-275193-0005.flac,possibly while escaping from the prospective mess kettle of a confederate picket in those days confederate pickets were not very particular as to the quality or kind of food and i have a suspicion that even a razor back would have been a welcome addition to their meal
10146,8123-275193-0002.flac,made him one of the most popular officers in the whole fleet he entered into all of their sports and sympathized with the discomforts of forecastle life he was fond of animal pets and always welcomed the arrival of a new one
10147,8123-275193-0007.flac,it was decided to put him on a light diet of milk which proved an immediate success for within forty eight hours after his first meal the patient became as lively as possible as days and weeks went on
10148,8123-275216-0042.flac,by this time there were many more human beings in the land than there were before and they made haste to hew down the oaks while there were still some remaining oak timber is better than beech timber they said
10149,8123-275216-0041.flac,and the storm broke them off and cast them on the ground the old oak had now only a few leavues left at the very top the end is near he said gravely
10150,8123-275216-0013.flac,but in this the old oak was wrong for they did come towards autumn the bear came back and lay down under the old oak my friends down there wish me to present their compliments he said
10151,8123-275216-0028.flac,how will you be able to hold out when a regular storm comes i assure you the wind gives one's head a good shaking my old boughs have creaked many a time and what do you think will become of the flimsy finery that you stick up in the air
10152,8123-275216-0019.flac,the sun shone on them and the rain fell on them so it was not long before they grew tall oh how pretty they are said the great oak and stooped his crooked boughs still more so that they could get a good view of them
10153,8123-275216-0006.flac,it was in a land down towards the south there i took a nap under the beech trees they are tall slim trees not crooked old things like you and their tops are so dense that the sunbeams cannot creep through them
10154,8123-275216-0031.flac,be good enough to move your leaves a little to one side there have been scarcely any buds on my lowest branches this year you overshadow me so i don't quite understand how that concerns us answered the beeches
10155,8123-275216-0025.flac,the beeches only laughed and went on growing at last they closed together over the little oak's head and then he died that was a horrid thing to do
10156,8123-275216-0040.flac,they are taking our strength out of us they said and shook as much as the beeches around would let them the land is ours no longer one bow died after another
10157,8123-275216-0016.flac,the snow lay high over the whole land and every tree stood deep in his own thoughts and dreamt of the spring and when the spring came the grass stood green and the birds began singing where they left off last
10158,8123-275216-0022.flac,and of good family besides the beeches laughed with their little tiny green leaves but said nothing shall i bend my branches a little aside so that the sun can shine better on you the old tree asked politely
10159,8123-275216-0045.flac,and not one of my acorns has sprouted under your shade but before i die i should like to know the name you give to such conduct that will not take long to say old friend answered the beeches
10160,8123-275216-0018.flac,and every morning when the sun came out they peeped down to look for the beeches they were really a little uneasy but they were too proud to talk about it and one day the little shoots did at last burst forth from the earth
10161,8123-275216-0034.flac,and sheltered you against the storm i let the sun shine on you as much as ever he would and i treated you as if you were my own children and in return for all this you stifle me stuff and nonsense
10162,8123-275216-0027.flac,you begin to be rather pushing the old tree said you should try to grow a little broader and stop this shooting up into the air just see where your branches are soaring
10163,8123-275216-0038.flac,all round new little beech trees shot up which grew just as fast as their parents and looked as green and as happy as if they did not know what an uneasy conscience was
10164,8123-275216-0021.flac,and they said no more but the little oak could not bear the strange trees it is dreadful the way you shoot up into the air he said in vexation you are already half as tall as i am but i beg you to take notice that i am much older
10165,8123-275216-0017.flac,the kings of the wood do not come till the whole company is assembled but at last they came all the leaves burst forth from the swollen buds and the trees looked at one another and complimented one another on their beauty
10166,8123-275216-0036.flac,and am glad to do you a good turn and the fox rolled on the ground at the foot of the beech trees and got his fur full of the prickly fruits and ran with them far out into the country the bear did the same
10167,8123-275216-0008.flac,and perhaps you will be kind enough to leave me at peace since you cannot give me shade the bear stretched himself out and closed his eyes but he got no sleep that time for the other trees had heard his story
10168,8123-275216-0007.flac,but i don't want to chatter any more with you just now i have had to trot a mile on account of a confounded hunter who struck me on one of my hind legs with an arrow now i should like to have a sleep
10169,8123-275216-0012.flac,if they come i will kill them said the little oak tree but directly afterwards he got one on the head from the old oak if they come you shall treat them politely you young dog said he but they will not come
10170,8123-275216-0032.flac,everyone has quite enough to do to look after himself if he is equal to his work and his luck it turns out well for him if not he must be prepared to go to the wall that is the way of the world
10171,8123-275216-0024.flac,and at last quite overtopped the little oak keep your leaves to yourself cried the oak you overshadow me and that is what i can't endure i must have plenty of sunshine
10172,8123-275216-0015.flac,they killed my wife and one of my brothers and i must see about finding a place where i can live in peace there is scarcely a spot left where a self respecting bear can stay good bye you old gnarled oak trees
10173,8123-275216-0037.flac,and grinned into the bargain at the old oak while he lay and rested in the shadow of the beeches the field mouse was beside himself with joy over his new food and thought that beech nuts tasted much nicer than acorns
10174,8123-275216-0023.flac,many thanks answered the beeches we can grow very nicely in the shade and the whole summer passed by and another summer after that and still more summers the beeches went on growing
10175,8123-275216-0044.flac,what an old stupid i was before that we oak trees were lords in the land and now every year i see my brothers around me perishing in the fight against you it will soon be all over with me
10176,8123-275216-0009.flac,what kind of trees can they be whose leaves sit so close together that the sunbeams cannot creep between them asked a little oak who was listening to what the big ones were talking about but by his side stood an old gnarled tree
10177,8123-275216-0020.flac,you are welcome among us said the old oak and graciously inclined his head to them you shall be my foster children and be treated just as well as my own thanks said the little beeches
10178,8123-275216-0026.flac,a great oak called out and shook his bouhs in terror but the old oak took his foster children under his protection it serves him right he said he is paid out for his boasting
10179,8123-275216-0011.flac,i will bring some beech nuts with me and i vow you will all turn yellow with jealousy when you see how pretty the new trees are then he made off but the oaks talked the whole day long one to another about the funny trees he had told them about
10180,8123-275216-0043.flac,at last we get a little appreciation said the old oak but we have to pay for it with our lives then he said to the beech trees what was i thinking of when i helped you on in your young days
10181,8123-275216-0014.flac,and he picked some funny things out of his shaggy coat here you may see what i have for you what is it asked the oak that is beech answered the bear the beech nuts which i promised you
10182,8123-275216-0010.flac,who gave the little oak a clout on the head with one of his lowest bous hold your tongue he said and don't talk till you have something to talk about you need none of you believe a word of the bear's nonsense
10183,8123-275216-0030.flac,that is not a polite way of speaking to an old tree with moss on his boughs said the oak i begin to repent that i was so kind to you if you have a spark of honorable feeling alive in you
10184,8123-275216-0033.flac,then the oak's lowest branch died and he began to be seriously alarmed you are pretty things he said if this is the way you reward me for my hospitality when you were little i let you grow at my feet
10185,8123-275216-0035.flac,said the beeches so they put forth flowers and fruit and when the fruit was ripe the wind shook the boughs and scattered it round far and wide you are quick people like me said the wind i like you for it
10186,8123-275216-0039.flac,but the old oak gazed sadly out over the wood the light green beech leaves were peeping out everywhere and the oaks were sighing and bewailing their distress to one another
10187,8123-275216-0029.flac,everyone has his own manner of growth and we have ours answered the young beeches this is the way it's done where we come from and we are perhaps as good as you are
10188,8123-275216-0001.flac,we are all oak trees they said we own the land and rule over it and they were right there were only a few human beings there in those days and those that there were were nothing better than wild animals
10189,8123-275216-0000.flac,trees but trees there were in plenty they stood everywhere from coast to coast they saw themselves reflected in all the rivers and lakes and stretched their mighty boughs up towards heaven
10190,8123-275216-0002.flac,the bear the wolf and the fox went out hunting while the stag grazed by the edge of the fen the field mouse sat outside his hole and ate acorns and the beaver built his artistic houses by the river banks
10191,8123-275216-0005.flac,i am lord in the land and whatever way you look you find my brothers and nothing else true muttered the bear that is just what is so sickening i have been for a little tour abroad i may tell you and 'm just a little bit spoilt
10192,8123-275216-0004.flac,said the bear licking his paws that is all the shade you can give against the sun if you are not pleased with me you can go answered the oak proudly
10193,8123-275216-0003.flac,one day the bear came trudging along and lay down at full breadth under a great oak tree are you there again you robber said the oak and shook a lot of withered leaves down over him you should not squander your leaves my old friend
10194,8123-275209-0022.flac,i would tell you if you would believe me sang the lark descending once more i believe everything i am told reiterated the caterpillar with as grave a face as if it were a fact
10195,8123-275209-0005.flac,was left standing alone by the side of the butterfly's eggs a pretty nurse she has chosen indeed poor lady exclaimed she and a pretty business i have in hand why her senses must have left her
10196,8123-275209-0017.flac,dou and the honey out of flowers i am afraid sighed the caterpillar no such thing old lady something simpler than that something that you can get at quite easily
10197,8123-275209-0013.flac,perhaps you will be able to inquire and hear something about it next time you go up high observed the caterpillar timidly the lark said perhaps he should but he did not satisfy her curiosity any further
10198,8123-275209-0011.flac,he must be very clever and know a great deal for to go up very high which she could never do was the caterpillar's idea of perfect glory now in the neighboring cornfield there lived a lark
10199,8123-275209-0025.flac,i will ask your advice no more i told you you would not believe me cried the lark nettled in his turn i believe everything that i am told persisted the caterpillar that is
10200,8123-275209-0014.flac,soon afterwards however he went singing upwards into the bright blue sky by degrees his voice died away in the distance till the green caterpillar could not hear a sound
10201,8123-275209-0016.flac,i believe everything i am told observed the caterpillar hastily well then first of all i will tell you what these little creatures are to eat what do you think it is to be guess
10202,8123-275209-0030.flac,and had already made a show of a hole in the cabbage leaf they had broken from the butterfly's eggs shame and amazement filled our green friend's heart but joy soon followed
10203,8123-275209-0033.flac,and when she was going into her chrysalis grave she said i shall be a butterfly some day but her relations thought her head was wandering and they said poor thing
10204,8123-275209-0010.flac,sighed the caterpillar in great distress and then she thought and thought till at last she thought of the lark and she fancied that because he went up so high and nobody knew where he went to
10205,8123-275209-0034.flac,and when she was a butterfly and was going to die again she said
10206,8123-275209-0024.flac,you jest with my inferiority now you are cruel as well as foolish
10207,8123-275209-0023.flac,then i'll tell you something else cried the lark for the best of my news remains behind you will one day be a butterfly yourself wretched bird exclaimed the caterpillar
10208,8123-275209-0004.flac,and with these words the butterfly drooped her wings and died and the green caterpillar who had not had the opportunity of even saying yes or no to the request
10209,8123-275209-0032.flac,and the caterpillar talked all the rest of her life to her relations of the time when she should be a butterfly but none of them believed her she nevertheless had learnt the lark's lesson of faith
10210,8123-275209-0021.flac,but i find that he is foolish and saucy instead
10211,8123-275209-0020.flac,and yet that is but a beginning of what i have to tell you why caterpillar what do you think those little eggs will turn out to be butterflies to be sure said the caterpillar caterpillars sang the lark
10212,8123-275209-0007.flac,however there lay the eggs on the cabbage leaf and the green caterpillar had a kind heart so she resolved to do her best but she got no sleep that night she was so very anxious
10213,8123-275209-0019.flac,but why do you ask me and then disbelieve what i say you have neither faith nor trust oh i believe everything i am told said the caterpillar nay but you do not replied the lark you won't believe me even about the food
10214,8123-275209-0027.flac,as well as you do look at my long green body and these endless legs and then talk to me about having wings and a painted feathery coat fool and fool you cried the indignant lark
10215,8123-275209-0029.flac,interrupted the lark how am i to learn faith asked the caterpillar at that moment she felt something at her side she looked round eight or ten little green caterpillars were moving about
10216,8123-275209-0009.flac,whom should the caterpillar consult there was the shaggy dog who sometimes came into the garden but he was so rough he would most likely whisk all the eggs off the cabbage leaf with one brush of his tail
10217,8123-275209-0018.flac,never said the caterpillar indignantly it was their dying mother's last request that i should do no such thing their dying mother knew nothing about the matter persisted the lark
10218,8123-275209-0012.flac,and the caterpillar sent a message to him to beg him to come and talk to her and when he came she told him all her difficulties and asked him what she was to do to feed and rear the little creatures so different from herself
10219,8123-275209-0028.flac,o caterpillar what comes to you from thence receive as i do

10223,8123-275209-0015.flac,so she resumed her walk round the butterfly's eggs nibbling a bit of the cabbage leaf now and then as she moved along

10225,8123-275209-0002.flac,you must give them early dew and honey from the flowers and you must let them fly about only a little way at first for of course one can't expect them to use their wings properly all at once

10230,7794-295955-0001.flac,but it was not a hare but a dragon which waited for and devoured him when some days had elapsed and the princess did not return either of them the whole court was in sorrow
10231,7794-295955-0027.flac,hold it don't let it go and the dogs sprang up and after it caught it and soon tore it to pieces but out of the boar flew a pigeon and the prince loosed the falcon and the falcon caught the pigeon
10232,7794-295955-0017.flac,come out to single combat with me that we may measure ourselves once more together unless you are a woman the dragon replied i will do so prince now now ere long behold the dragon it was large it was terrible
10233,7794-295955-0009.flac,took a shepherd's staff in his hand and went into the world as he went on thus from village to village and from town to town at last he came into another empire and into the imperial city in a lake under which the dragon was

10235,7794-295955-0008.flac,my strength is a long way off and you cannot go thither far in another empire under the emperor's city is a lake and in that lake is a dragon and in that dragon a boar and in the boar a pigeon and in that is my strength
10236,7794-295955-0015.flac,because he had come whereus previously no shepherd had been able to come from the lake the next day the prince got ready again and went with his sheep straight to the lake but the emperor sent two grooms after him to go stealthily and see what he did
10237,7794-295955-0026.flac,then he swung the dragon and tossed it high into the air and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces but as it burst into pieces out of it sprang a wild boar and started to run away but the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs
10238,7794-295955-0006.flac,the old woman interrupted him how should i not it captured me too in this way but now i have no means of escape then he proceeded listen well to what i am going to say to you ask it whither it goes and where its strength is
10239,7794-295955-0016.flac,and they placed themselves on a high hill whence they could have a good view when the shepherd arrived he put the hounds and bagpipes under the stump and the falcon upon it then tucked up his hose and sleeves wadded into the lake and shouted dragon dragon
10240,7794-295955-0010.flac,on going into the town he began to inquire who wanted a shepherd the citizens told him that the emperor did then he went straight to the emperor after he announced himself the emperor admitted him into his presence and asked him
10241,7794-295955-0022.flac,so many people when on the morrow the day dawned and the sun came forth up rose the shepherd up rose the maiden too to begin to prepare for going to the lake the shepherd was cheerful more cheerful than ever
10242,7794-295955-0030.flac,he washed himself nicely took the falcon on his shoulder the hounds behind him and the bagpipes under his arm played as he went drove the sheep
10243,7794-295955-0019.flac,when the night approached the prince drove the sheep as before and went home playing the bagpipes when he arrived at the town the whole town was astir and began to wonder because the shepherd came home every evening which no one had been able to do before
10244,7794-295955-0024.flac,when they arrived at the lake the sheep immediately spread round ed and the prince placed the falcon on the stump and the hounds and bagpipes under it then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the water and shouted dragon dragon

10246,7794-295955-0025.flac,the prince replied come dragon don't talk nonsense if i had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead i would toss you much higher when he said this the emperor's daughter ran up and kissed him on the face on the eye and on the forehead
10247,7794-295955-0000.flac,then the middle son went hunting and as he issued from the town a hare sprang out of a bush and the prince after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into the water mill and the prince after it
10248,7794-295955-0020.flac,those two grooms had already arrived at the palace before the prince and related to the emperor in order everything that they had heard and seen now when the emperor saw that the shepherd returned home he immediately summoned his daughter into his presence and told her all
10249,7794-295955-0029.flac,so that you could settle a populous empire there too are your brothers when the pigeon had told him all this the prince immediately wrung its neck the emperor had gone out in person
10250,7794-295955-0007.flac,when the dragon came in the old woman began to question it where in god's name have you been whither do you go so far you will never tell me whither you go the dragon replied well my dear old woman i do go far
10251,7794-295955-0014.flac,let me go prince that i may moisten my parched head in the lake and toss you to the sky but the prince replied come dragon don't talk nonsense if i had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead i would toss you still higher
10252,7794-295955-0013.flac,and the hounds and bagpipes under the stump then tucked up his hose and sleeves waded into the lake and began to shout dragon dragon come out to single combat with me to day
10253,7794-295955-0004.flac,she replied my son that was not a hare but a dragon it kills and throttles many people hearing this the prince was somewhat disturbed and said to the old woman what shall we do now doubtless my two brothers also have perished here
10254,7794-295955-0021.flac,and i am your only daughter and you don't care about me if i perish then the emperor began to persuade and encourage her don't fear my daughter you see we have had so many changes of shepherds and of all that went out to the lake not one has returned
10255,7794-295955-0023.flac,but the emperor's daughter was sad and shed tears the shepherd comforted her lady sister i pray you do not weep but do what i tell you when it is time run up and kiss me and fear not as he went and drove the sheep
10256,7794-295955-0031.flac,when they came to the town all the town assembled as to see a wonder the emperor who had seen all his heroism from the hill called him into his presence and gave him his daughter went immediately to church had them married and held a wedding festival for a week
10257,7794-295955-0003.flac,but the prince did not choose to follow it but went to find other game saying to himself when i return i shall find you after thus he went for a long time up and down the hill but found nothing and then returned to the water mill
10258,7794-295955-0011.flac,and when you call the sheep out they go thither at once and spread themselves round the lake but whatever shepherd goes off there that shepherd returns back no more therefore my son i tell you
10259,7794-295955-0005.flac,the old woman answered they have indeed but there is no help for it go home my son lest you follow them then he said to her dear old woman do you know what i know that you will be glad to liberate yourself from that pest
10260,7794-295955-0002.flac,then the third son went hunting to see whether he could not find his brothers when he issued from the town again up sprang a hare out of a bush and the prince after it and hither and thither till the hare fled into the water mill

10268,7794-295947-0016.flac,last night the fox's liver that you required fell into his hands so he sent me to bring it to you with these words the messenger produced a small jar adding in a few days he will let you know the price
10269,7794-295947-0033.flac,and spent the night in reciting prayers and praises and the next day they published the matter to the household and to their relations and friends now although there are instances of men killing their own children to requite a favor
10270,7794-295947-0005.flac,and gave half a bu to the three boys who ran away delighted the man's friend upon this said to him well certainly you have got queer tastes what on earth are you going to keep the fox for
10271,7794-295947-0012.flac,now the man who had rescued the fox's cub was a tradesman in good circumstances he had three or four agents and two maidservants besides men servants and altogether he lived in a liberal manner he was married and this union had brought him one son
10272,7794-295947-0024.flac,which you had just procured and said that he would come and tell us the price another day when we asked him to spend the night here he answered that he would lodge with a relation in the next village and went away the visitor was more and more lost in amazement and
10273,7794-295947-0017.flac,when he had delivered his message the master of the house was greatly pleased and said indeed i am deeply grateful for this kindness which will save my son's life then the good wife came out and received the jar with every mark of politeness
10274,7794-295947-0011.flac,so with peace in their hearts the latter went off to another place and choosing a pretty spot produced the wine bottle and ate their noonday meal and after a pleasant day they returned to their homes and became firmer friends than ever
10275,7794-295947-0025.flac,last spring when i was taking out my cub to play it was carried off by some boys and only saved by your goodness the desire to requite this kindness pierced me to the quick at last when calamity attacked your house

10278,7794-295947-0000.flac,on the same errand as themselves as soon as the children saw the foxes they picked up a bamboo stick and took the creatures stealthily in the rear and when the old foxes took to flight they surrounded them and beat them with a stick
10279,7794-295947-0008.flac,the other retiring backward and bowing with his hands on his knees replied indeed indeed i am filled with admiration at the goodness of your heart when i hear you speak thus i feel more than ever how great is the love i bear you
10280,7794-295947-0004.flac,and got us to come out to the hills and catch one and so we can't sell him to you at any price well i suppose it cannot be helped then but how much would the young man give you for the cub oh he'll give us three hundred cash at least

10283,7794-295947-0014.flac,we don't care what price we might have to pay for a fox's liver pray buy one for us at any expense so they pressed him to exert himself on their behalf and he having promised faithfully to execute the commission went his way
10284,7794-295947-0026.flac,i thought i might be of use to you your son's illness could not be cured without a liver taken from a live fox so to repay your kindness i killed my cub and took out its liver then its sire disguising himself as a messenger

10287,7794-295947-0027.flac,brought it to your house and as she spoke the fox shed tears and the master of the house wishing to thank her moved in bed upon which his wife awoke and asked him what was the matter but he too to her great astonishment
10288,7794-295947-0032.flac,when she heard this the good wife likewise was blinded by her tears and for a while they lay lost in thought but at last coming to themselves they lighted the lamp on the shelf on which the family idol stood
10289,7794-295947-0028.flac,was biting the pillow and weeping bitterly why are you weeping thus asked she at last he sat up in bed and said last spring when i was out on a pleasure excursion i was the means of saving the life of a fox's cub
10290,7794-295947-0006.flac,how could i stand by and see life taken it was but a little i spent only half a bu to save the cub but had it cost a fortune i should not have grudged it i thought you were intimate enough with me to know my heart
10291,7794-295947-0030.flac,to buy it for me how the foxes came to hear of this i don't know but the foxes to whom i had shown kindness killed their own cub and took out the liver and the old dog fox disguising himself as a messenger from the person to whom
10292,7794-295947-0003.flac,well replied the other after considering the matter attentively i suppose it's all the same to you whom you sell him to you'd better let me have him oh but the young man from our village promised us a good sum if we could find a fox
10293,7794-295947-0019.flac,and i will pass the night with him and so he took his leave and went away the parents lost no time in sending to let the physician know that they had procured the fox's liver the next day the doctor came and compounded a medicine for the patient
10294,7794-295947-0039.flac,whose penniless condition forms a great contrast to the wealth of their inferiors in rank the daimose i believe that this is the only case in which rank can be bought or sold in japan
10295,7794-295947-0034.flac,there is no other example of foxes having done such a thing so the story became the talk of the whole country now the boy who had recovered through the efficacy of this medicine selected the prettiest spot on the premises
10296,7794-295947-0015.flac,in the night of the following day there came a messenger who announced himself as coming from the person who had undertaken to procure the fox's liver so the master of the house went out to see him i have come from mister so and so
10297,7794-295947-0001.flac,so that they ran away as fast as their legs could carry them but two of the boys held down the cub and seizing it by the scruff of the neck went off in high glee the two friends were looking on all the while and one of them raising his voice shouted out
10298,7794-295947-0029.flac,as i told you at the time the other day i told mister so and so that although my son were to die before my eyes i would not be the means of killing a fox on purpose but asked him in case he heard of any hunter killing a fox
10299,7794-295947-0023.flac,pray inquire carefully into the matter well this is very strange four nights ago a man of some five or six and thirty years of age came with a verbal message from you to the effect that you had sent him with a fox's liver
10300,7794-295947-0021.flac,how quickly you fulfilled our wishes and how kind of you to send at once the doctor prepared the medicine and now our boy can get up and walk about the room and it's all owing to your goodness wait a bit cried the guest
10301,7794-295947-0018.flac,we must make a present to the messenger indeed sir i've already been paid for my trouble well at any rate you must stop the night here thank you sir i've a relation in the next village whom i have not seen for a long while

10303,7794-295947-0022.flac,who did not know what to make of the joy of the two parents the commission with which you entrusted me about the fox's liver turned out to be a matter of impossibility so i came to day to make my excuses and now i really can't understand what you are so grateful to me for
10304,7794-295947-0020.flac,which at once produced a good effect and there was no little joy in the household as luck would have it three days after this the man whom they had commissioned to buy the fox's liver came to the house so the good wife hurried out to meet him and welcome him
10305,7794-295947-0013.flac,even though our child should die for it they said we will not ourselves deprive other creatures of their lives but you who live among the hills are sure to hear when your neighbors go out fox hunting
10306,7794-295947-0031.flac,we had confided the commission came here with it his mate has just been at my pillow side and told me all about it hence it was that in spite of myself i was moved to tears
10307,7794-295947-0002.flac,hallo you boys what are you doing with that fox the eldest of the boys replied we're going to take him home and sell him to a young man in our village he'll buy him and then he'll boil him in a pot and eat him
10308,7794-295948-0009.flac,being such as i am i have no desire and no wishes glad as i am to hear your kind intentions there is nothing that i can ask you to do for me you need feel no anxiety on my account as long as i live when the winter comes
10309,7794-295948-0022.flac,fused it afresh in the fire and at this work i spent months and days as the badger finished speaking the priest looked at the money which it had produced and sure enough he saw that it was bright and new and clean
10310,7794-295948-0010.flac,you shall be welcome here the badger on hearing this could not conceal its admiration of the depth of the old man's benevolence but having so much to be grateful for it felt hurt at not being able to requite it
10311,7794-295948-0000.flac,night and morning he recited the prayer
10312,7794-295948-0005.flac,went into the hut and squatting down by the fire began to warm itself and the priest with renewed fervor recited his prayers and struck his bell before the image of buddha looking straight before him
10313,7794-295948-0025.flac,it came and spent the winter nights with him from this story it is plain that even beasts have a sense of gratitude in this quality dogs excel all other beasts
10314,7794-295948-0018.flac,the priest thought this very strange but imagined either that the badger stayed away because it did not like to come without the money or that it had been killed in an attempt to steal it and he blamed himself for having added to his sins for no purpose
10315,7794-295948-0011.flac,as this subject was often renewed between them the priest at last touched by the goodness of the badger's heart said since i have shaven my head renounced the world and forsaken the pleasures of this life i have no desire to gratify
10316,7794-295948-0026.flac,written in the annals of japan
10317,7794-295948-0024.flac,but i shall say that the badger that gave me the money has ceased coming to my hut you need not fear being waylaid but can come as of old and shelter yourself from the cold to this the badger nodded assent and as long as the old priest lived
10318,7794-295948-0007.flac,the priest at last became very friendly with it and got used to its company so that if ever as the night wore on the badger did not arrive he used to miss it and wonder why it did not come
10319,7794-295948-0004.flac,but now i am growing old and this severe cold is more than i can bear i pray you to let me enter and warm myself at the fire of your cottage that i may live through this bitter night
10320,7794-295948-0015.flac,i have told you what is on my mind when the priest had done speaking the badger leant its head on one side with a puzzled and anxious look so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a wish which seemed to give the beast trouble
10321,7794-295948-0012.flac,yet i own i should like to possess three rios in gold food and raiment i receive by the favor of the villagers so i take no heed for those things were i to die to morrow and attain my wish of being born again into the next world
10322,7794-295948-0002.flac,and when his roof or his walls fell out of repair they would mend them for him so for the things of this world he took no thought one very cold night when he little thought any one was outside he heard a voice calling
10323,7794-295948-0023.flac,as he was thanking the badger with great politeness and ceremony the beast said in doing this i have but fulfilled my own wish still i hope that you will tell this thing to no man indeed replied the priest
10324,7794-295948-0014.flac,whereby i might enter into salvation yet i would not get this money by violent or unlawful means i only think of what might be if i had it so you see since you have expressed such kind feelings toward me
10325,7794-295948-0008.flac,and even after my death i must remember them what can i do to requite them if there is anything that you wish for pray tell me the priest smiling at this speech answered
10326,7794-295948-0021.flac,if the money which you required had been for unlawful purposes i could easily have procured as much as ever you might have wanted but when i heard that it was to be offered to a temple for masses for your soul
10327,7794-295948-0003.flac,your reverence your reverence so he rose and went out to see who it was and there he beheld an old badger standing any ordinary man would have been greatly alarmed at the apparition
10328,7794-295948-0001.flac,although the fame of his virtue did not reach far yet his neighbors respected and revered him
10329,7794-295948-0019.flac,repenting when it was too late persuaded however that the badger must have been killed he passed his time in putting up prayers upon prayers for it after three years had gone by one night
10330,7794-295948-0013.flac,the same kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body thus although i have no other reason to wish for money still if i had three reors i would offer them up at some holy shrine that masses and prayers might be said for me
10331,7794-295948-0020.flac,the old man heard a voice near his door calling out your reverence your reverence as the voice was like that of the badger he jumped up as soon as he heard it and ran to open the door and there sure enough was the badger
10332,7794-295948-0006.flac,after two hours the badger took its leave with profuse expressions of thanks and went out and from that time forth it came every night to the hut as the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches and dead leaves from the hills for firewood
10333,7794-295948-0017.flac,and the badger feigning assent to what the priest had impressed upon it returned to the hills as usual from that time forth the badger came no more to the hut
10334,7794-295948-0016.flac,and tried to retract what he had said post humous honors after all are the wish of ordinary men i who am a priest ought not to entertain such thoughts or to want money so pray pay no attention to what i have said
10335,2007-149877-0018.flac,and a watch chain of solid gold which held a charm of rich design and a watch of the latest make and engraving he knew by name and could greet personally with a well old fellow
10336,2007-149877-0011.flac,with rich screens fancy wines and a line of bargoods unsurpassed in the country at rectors drouet had met mister g w hurstwood manager of fitzgerald and moys
10337,2007-149877-0014.flac,and was glad not only to meet him but to visit the atams street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind he was shrewd and clever in many little things
10338,2007-149877-0029.flac,and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited and so managed to make himself almost invariably agreeable to night he was particularly so since his report to the company had been favorably commented upon
10339,2007-149877-0030.flac,his new samples had been satisfactorily selected and his trip marked out for the next six weeks why hello charlie old man
10340,2007-149877-0058.flac,come around after the show i have something i want to show you said hurstwood sure said drouet elated you haven't anything on hand for the night have you added hurstwood not a thing well come round then
10341,2007-149877-0045.flac,in the last analysis that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations but rather of the innate trend of the mind that such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed
10342,2007-149877-0025.flac,and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great american upper class the first grade below the luxuriously rich
10343,2007-149877-0003.flac,rectors with its polished marble walls and floor its profusion of lights its show of china and silverware and above all its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go
10344,2007-149877-0009.flac,the floors were of brightly colored tiles the walls a composition of rich dark polished wood which reflected the light and colored stucco work which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance
10345,2007-149877-0061.flac,twelve o'clock said hurstwood that's right
10346,2007-149877-0047.flac,and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber
10347,2007-149877-0007.flac,particularly among those who had not yet reached but hoped to do so the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented you don't say so would be the reply why y
10348,2007-149877-0021.flac,too rich too famous or too successful with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address and with these he was professionally tactful assuming a grave and dignified attitude paying them the deference which would win their good feeling
10349,2007-149877-0060.flac,say she was a little dandy i tell you
10350,2007-149877-0040.flac,it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save formalities where the sharp eared may hear and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst
10351,2007-149877-0000.flac,on this particular evening he dined at rector's a restaurant of some local fame which occupied a basement of clark and monrose streets thereafter he visited the resort of fitzgerald and moys in adam street opposite the imposing federal building
10352,2007-149877-0041.flac,nevertheless the fact that here men gather here chatter here love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires
10353,2007-149877-0038.flac,to one not inclined to drink and gifted with a more serious turn of mind such a bubbling chattering glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly a strange commentary on nature and life
10354,2007-149877-0035.flac,as was considered proper and hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with celzer what's become of caryoe remarked hurstwood i haven't seen him around here in two weeks
10355,2007-149877-0002.flac,drouet was not a drinker in excess he was not a moneyed man he only craved the best as his mind conceived it and such doings seemed to him a part of the best
10356,2007-149877-0055.flac,well you never can tell said hurstwood there may be something to it i wouldn't bother about it myself though by the way he added are you going anywhere to night the hole in the ground
10357,2007-149877-0005.flac,or that henry et dixie a well known performer of the day was then only a few tables off at rectors he could always obtain this satisfaction for there one could encounter politicians brokers actors
10358,2007-149877-0010.flac,the long bar was a blaze of lights polished woodwork colored and cut glassware and many fancy bottles
10359,2007-149877-0028.flac,a moderate sense of humor and could tell a good story when the occasion required he could talk races with hurstwood
10360,2007-149877-0042.flac,the many friends he met here dropped in because they craved
10361,2007-149877-0027.flac,hurstwood knew caryoe quite well having drunk a glass now and then with him in company with several others when the conversation was general
10362,2007-149877-0006.flac,some rich young rounders of the town all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation that's so and so over there was a common remark of these gentlemen among themselves
10363,2007-149877-0057.flac,some bound for the theatres some to their clubs and some to that most fascinating of all the pleasures for the type of man there represented at least the ladies yes i will said drouet
10364,2007-149877-0043.flac,the company the glow the atmosphere which they found one might take it after all as an augur of the better social order for the things which they satisfied here though censory were not evil
10365,2007-149877-0024.flac,to go to the races the theatres the sporting entertainments at some of the clubs he kept a horse and neat trap had his wife and two children who were well established in a neat house on the north side near lincoln park
10366,2007-149877-0015.flac,and capable of creating a good impression his managerial position was fairly important a kind of stewardship which was imposing but lacked financial control he had risen by perseverance and industry
10367,2007-149877-0033.flac,leaned toward them from behind the bar old pepper said drouet a little of the same for me put in hurstwood how long are you in town this time inquired hurstwood only until wednesday i'm going up to saint paul
10368,2007-149877-0004.flac,he loved fine clothes good eating and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men when dining it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that joseph jefferson was wont to come to this same place
10369,2007-149877-0037.flac,no he can't injure that any i guess hurstwood was standing his coat open his thumbs in his pocket the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness he was the picture of fastidious comfort
10370,2007-149877-0056.flac,said drouet mentioning the popular farce of the time well you'd better be going it's half after eight already and he drew out his watch the crowd was already thinning out considerably
10371,2007-149877-0026.flac,the latter's genial nature and dressy appearance pleased him he knew that drouet was only a travelling sellsman and not one of many years at that but the firm of bartlet cario and company
10372,2007-149877-0046.flac,could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of liquor
10373,2007-149877-0036.flac,barely comes down to the office now just one boy hasn't he asked hurstwood yes and a swift pacer laughed drouet
10374,2007-149877-0017.flac,and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in for the most part he lounged about dressed in excellent tailored suits of imported goods a solitare ring a fine blue diamond in his tie a striking vest of some new pattern
10375,2007-149877-0012.flac,he had been pointed out as a very successful and well known man about town hurstwood looked the part for besides being slightly under forty he had a good stout constitution an active manner and a solid substantial air
10376,2007-149877-0023.flac,these were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously
10377,2007-149877-0051.flac,no where said drouet
10378,2007-149877-0034.flac,george evans was in here saturday and said he saw you in milwaukee last week yes i saw george returned drouet great old boy isn't he we had quite a time there together
10379,2007-149877-0049.flac,under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing under the stars and sweeping night winds what a lamp flower it must bloom
10380,2007-149877-0059.flac,i struck a little peach coming in on the train friday remarked drouet by way of parting by george that's so i must go and call on her before i go away oh never mind her hurstwood remarked
10381,2007-149877-0048.flac,the dressy greedy company the small self interested palaver the disorganized aimless wandering mental action which it represents the love of light and show and finery which to one outside
10382,2007-149877-0054.flac,returned hurstwood he's got the money all right and a little twinkle passed over his eyes i don't go much on those things do you
10383,2007-149877-0050.flac,insect infested rose of pleasure see that fellow coming in there said hurstwood glancing at a gentleman just entering arrayed in a high hat and prince albert coat his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating
10384,2007-149877-0052.flac,said hurstwood indicating the direction by a cast of his eye the man with the silk hat oh yes said drouet now affecting not to see who is he that's jueles wallace the spiritualist
10385,2007-149877-0053.flac,drouet followed him with his eyes much interested doesn't look much like a man who sees spirits does he said drouet
10386,2007-149877-0044.flac,no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber the worst effect of such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the material minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis
10387,2007-149877-0013.flac,which was composed in part of his fine clothes his clean linen his jewels and above all his own sense of his importance drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing
10388,2007-149877-0016.flac,the chief executive in financial functions devolved upon the owners
10389,2007-149877-0039.flac,here come the moths in endless procession to basq in the light of the flame such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds
10390,2007-149877-0019.flac,hundreds of actors merchants politicians and the general run of successful characters about town and it was part of his success to do so he had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship which improved from the how do you do
10391,2007-149877-0008.flac,why he's manager of the grand opera house when these things would fall upon drouet's ears he would straighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort if he had any vanity this augmented it
10392,2007-149877-0032.flac,friday said drouet had a fine trip glad of it said hurstwood his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make believe that usually dwelt in them what are you going to take he added as the bar keeper in snowy jacket and tie
10393,2007-149877-0031.flac,how goes it the room was crowded drouet shook hands beaming good nature and they strolled towards the bar oh all right i haven't seen you in six weeks when did you get in
10394,2007-149877-0022.flac,without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions there were in the last place a few good followers neither rich nor poor famous nor yet remarkably successful with whom he was friendly on the score of good fellowship
10395,2007-149877-0020.flac,who by long frequenting of the place became aware of his position to the why old man how are you which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly there was a class however
10396,2007-149877-0001.flac,there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whisky and purchased a couple of cigars one of which he lighted this to him represented in part high life a fair sample of what the whole must be
10397,2007-132570-0051.flac,yet something like a shade of fear passed over his countenance emily sat down in a chair near the door for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her but montoni paused scarcely an instant in commanding his features
10398,2007-132570-0011.flac,come forth my valorous signor steward just then old carloa opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand for as soon as the signor saw him
10399,2007-132570-0052.flac,resumed his discourse in a lower yet sterner voice i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me
10400,2007-132570-0013.flac,interrupted emily quite wearied by this story do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice
10401,2007-132570-0028.flac,and he could be here in no other character how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart
10402,2007-132570-0032.flac,but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady's death too
10403,2007-132570-0054.flac,for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition it would not now appease my indignation i will have vengeance as well as justice another groan filled the pause which montoni made
10404,2007-132570-0008.flac,yes he did indeed ma'amselle notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary
10405,2007-132570-0044.flac,from her infancy regarded an act of injustice inspired her with a noble though imprudent courage sign the papers said montoni more impatiently than before never sir
10406,2007-132570-0030.flac,the ladies as they call themselves who are lately come to udolfho why that signora livona that the signor brought to see my late lady at venice is his mistress now and was little better than i dare say and ludovico says
10407,2007-132570-0039.flac,i will condescend to advise where i may command
10408,2007-132570-0049.flac,yet this it appears has not been sufficient to deter you
10409,2007-132570-0045.flac,replied emily that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right montoni turned pale with anger while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech
10410,2007-132570-0015.flac,now i dare say you are thinking of monsieur valancourt and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state and that he has met with some of our people and is taking captive
10411,2007-132570-0047.flac,you have dared to question my right now dare to question my power i have a punishment which you think not of it is terrible this night this very night this
10412,2007-132570-0036.flac,because said he we don't go shares there this information heightened emily's impatience to know more and annette immediately departed on her inquiry the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations
10413,2007-132570-0021.flac,all the world could not persuade me out of them raberto and sebastion and half a dozen more of them went into fits to be sure there was no occasion for that i said myself there was no need of that
10414,2007-132570-0027.flac,opposite to her casement she was for a moment inclined to believe it was valancourt whom she had seen yet if it was he why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so and if he was a prisoner in the castle
10415,2007-132570-0019.flac,and then it was gone and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls so they helped one another up again as fast as they could you would not believe ma'amselle though i showed you the very cannon where it used to appear
10416,2007-132570-0007.flac,well well said emily impatiently and anxious to inquire on another subject
10417,2007-132570-0042.flac,let the recollection of your aunt's sufferings in consequence of her folly an obstinacy teach you a lesson sign the papers emily's resolution was for a moment awed she shrunk at the recollections he revived
10418,2007-132570-0000.flac,what were they disputing then said emily no ma'amselle not fighting but almost as good for i believe there was not one of the signor sober
10419,2007-132570-0017.flac,ma'am replied annette and would not you be glad too to see signor valancourt i don't know any chevalier i like better i have a very great regard for the signor truly
10420,2007-132570-0048.flac,night repeated another voice montoni paused and turned half round but seeming to recollect himself he proceeded in a lower tone you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly
10421,2007-132570-0037.flac,the possibility that valancourt was near her revived her fortitude and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoni requiring her attendance in the cedar parlor
10422,2007-132570-0012.flac,he was as tame as could be and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his basket all this i saw through the keyhole well annette said ludovico jeeringly shall i let you out now
10423,2007-132570-0050.flac,i could make you tremble at the bare recital he was interrupted by a groan which seemed to rise from underneath the chamber they were in and as he threw a glance round it impatience and rage flashed from his eyes
10424,2007-132570-0056.flac,quit my presence cried montoni this affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation did you hear nothing signor said emily trembling and still unable to leave the room
10425,2007-132570-0014.flac,but it is expected back to night or to morrow and i shall know then perhaps emily inquired if she had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners ah ma'amselle said annette archly
10426,2007-132570-0060.flac,whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were perhaps bringing to the castle at length having reached her apartment she threw herself upon the couch overcome with the new horrors of her situation
10427,2007-132570-0022.flac,for says i when the enemy comes what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down in fits all of a row the enemy won't be so civil perhaps as to walk off like the ghost and leave them to help one another up
10428,2007-132570-0006.flac,no no says he i will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage and up the marble staircase and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle for you shall stay here annette you shall not go out of this room to night so
10429,2007-132570-0016.flac,oh lord how glad i should be if it was so would you indeed be glad said emily in a tone of mournful reproach to be sure i should
10430,2007-132570-0002.flac,and fine trimmings boded no good i guessed what they were good god exclaimed emily what will become of me
10431,2007-132570-0033.flac,but she cannot hear them now poor soul said i emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired annette to go and make inquiry concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle
10432,2007-132570-0055.flac,leave the room instantly said he seeming not to notice this strange occurrence without power to implore his pity she rose to go but found that she could not support herself awe and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair
10433,2007-132570-0009.flac,and he mistook ludovico's hall for old carlo's
10434,2007-132570-0031.flac,but pray be secret ma'am that his excellenza introduced her only to impose upon the world that had begun to make free with her character so when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal
10435,2007-132570-0058.flac,obey my order repeated montoni and for these fools tricks i will soon discover by whom they are practised emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her
10436,2007-132570-0038.flac,which she obeyed with trembling and on her way thither endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of valancourt montoni was alone i sent for you said he to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions
10437,2007-132570-0023.flac,but will fall too cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men no no says i there is reason in all things
10438,2007-132570-0025.flac,nay ma'amselle you will believe nothing you are almost as bad as the signor himself who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret this was a hard
10439,2007-132570-0020.flac,and are you indeed so simple annette said emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories credit them ma'amselle why
10440,2007-132570-0034.flac,but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name or that of monsieur valancourt now i think of it ma'amselle said annette i do believe there are prisoners for i overheard one of the signor's men yesterday
10441,2007-132570-0003.flac,if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken signors
10442,2007-132570-0029.flac,were the same or if they were whether this was valancourt she however desired that annette would endeavor to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names oh dear ma'amselle said annette i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about
10443,2007-132570-0057.flac,i heard my own voice rejoined montoni sternly and nothing else
10444,2007-132570-0026.flac,but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so than you have ma'am emily looked displeased and made no reply as she mused upon the recollected appearance which had lately so much alarmed her and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself
10445,2007-132570-0040.flac,if i have no right in these estates sir said emily of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them if the lands are yours by law you certainly may possess them without my interference or my consent
10446,2007-132570-0046.flac,then all my vengeance falls upon you he exclaimed with an horrible oath and think not it shall be delayed
10447,2007-132570-0004.flac,and across the great hall and up the marble staircase and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle and i am in the corridor in a minute are you so says he and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way
10448,2007-132570-0024.flac,being because it is no business of mine to look gruff and fight battles emily endeavored to correct the superstitious weakness of annette though she could not entirely subdue her own to which the latter only replied
10449,2007-132570-0041.flac,i will have no more argument said montoni with a look that made her tremble what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby but i will be trifled with no longer
10450,2007-132570-0001.flac,and what is more not one of those fine ladies sober either i thought when i saw them first that all those fine silks and fine veils why ma'amsell their veils were worked with silver
10451,2007-132570-0018.flac,your regard for him cannot be doubted said emily since you wish to see him a prisoner why no ma'amselle not a prisoner either but one must be glad to see him you know and it was only the other night i dreamt
10452,2007-132570-0035.flac,and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellenza to catch up men and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms
10453,2007-132570-0043.flac,and from the vengeance he threatened but then the image of valancourt who so long had loved her and who was now perhaps so near her came to her heart and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always
10454,2007-132570-0053.flac,i could tell you that when once my resolution is taken but i am talking to a baby let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples i could recite the recital could not now benefit you
10455,2007-132570-0010.flac,so we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room but the signor was as cunning as the best of us and kept calling out at the door
10456,2007-132570-0005.flac,well says i if you think there is danger then go with me and guard me i am never afraid when you are by what says he when i am scarcely recovered of one wound shall i put myself in the way of getting another
10457,2007-132570-0059.flac,but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence pass to the ramparts as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement emily saw a party of montoni's troops winding down a distant mountain
10458,8838-298545-0012.flac,for the voice was a loud and rasping one a young man stood at the entrance a stocky bull necked young miner in tweed sunday clothes and an aggressive necktie he was a sinister looking figure with dark insolent eyes
10459,8838-298545-0033.flac,good lad he'll do yet cried pervis gentlemen said montgomery i think that you will acknowledge that i have boon very patient with you
10460,8838-298545-0027.flac,and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair a fat red hand upon either knee and stared critically at the young assistant so did the third visitor falset the horse breaker who leaned back his long thin legs with their boxcloth riding gaiters
10461,8838-298545-0005.flac,his appearance and words were always vaguely benevolent a sudden impulse came over the despondent student he would test the reality of this philanthropy i beg your pardon doctor oldacre said he rising from his chair
10462,8838-298545-0023.flac,said the man and lurched out at the door the assistant looking after him saw him rolling with an uncertain step down the street until a friend met him and they walked on arm in arm the man seemed in his rough northern fashion to bear no grudge
10463,8838-298545-0010.flac,that you should have put me into the painful position of having to refuse you he turned upon his heel and walked with offended dignity out of the surgery the student smiled bitterly and turned to his work of making up the morning prescriptions
10464,8838-298545-0013.flac,an the jaw and throat of a bull dog look yere said he again why hast thou not sent to medicine whoop is thy master ordered montgomery had become accustomed to the brutal frankness of the northern worker at first it had enraged him
10465,8838-298545-0031.flac,but training for everyday work ain't the same as training with a trainer and i dare bet with all respect to your opinion mister wilson that there's half a stone of tallow on him at this minute the young cantab put his fingers on the assistant's upper arm
10466,8838-298545-0004.flac,and the rule of his life was never by word or action to run a risk of offending the sentiment which had made him his standard of respectability and of dignity was exceedingly high and he expected the same from his assistance
10467,8838-298545-0030.flac,have you been waite lately mister montgomery it was the first direct question which had been asked him he had stood in the midst of them like a horse at affair and he was just beginning to wonder whether he was more angry or amused i am just elevenstone said he
10468,8838-298545-0051.flac,it is the most sporting thing i ever heard of in my life said young wilson by george sir if you pull it off you've got the constituency in your pocket if you care to stand you know the outhouse in my garden next the road exactly
10469,8838-298545-0020.flac,loosened his collar and squeezed the surgery sponge over his face he sat up at last with a gasp and a scowl dumn thee thou spoilt my necktie said he mopping up the water from his breast
10470,8838-298545-0035.flac,for it would be somethin new to find isaac falsood as a spoil sport well then we will make up the hundred for the stake among us and the fight stands always supposing the young man is wellin excuse all this rot mister montgomery
10471,8838-298545-0043.flac,if you can lick ted barton you may lick the master of croxley but if you don't we're done for there's no one else who is in the same street with him in this district it's twenty rounds two ounce gloves queen'sbury rules and a decision on points if you fight to the finish
10472,8838-298545-0046.flac,than his brains in a year but a chill of doubt came over him how can i fight for the coal pits said he i am not connected with them ey lad but thou art cried old purvise we've got it down in writin and it's clear enough
10473,8838-298545-0040.flac,however that's neither here nor there montgomery looked at them in bewilderment for goodness sake gentlemen tell me what it is you want me to do he cried we want you to fight sirles craggs better known as the master of croxley
10474,8838-298545-0017.flac,the blows were almost simultaneous a savage swing which whistled past montgomery's ear and a straight drive which took the workman on the chin luck was with the assistant that single whizzing upper cut and the way in which it was delivered
10475,8838-298545-0003.flac,he was roused from his black meditation by the entrance of doctor oldacre himself a large clean shaven respectable man with a prim manner and an austere face he had prospered exceedingly by the support of the local church interest
10476,8838-298545-0048.flac,or any other shape which might suggest itself to you you see you are responsible for our having lost our champion so we really feel that we have a claim upon you give me a moment gentlemen it is very unexpected
10477,8838-298545-0002.flac,he should be back again at the university completing the last year which would give him his medical degree but alas he had not the money with which to pay his class fees nor could he imagine how he could procure it
10478,8838-298545-0006.flac,i have a great favor to ask of you the doctor's appearance was not encouraging his mouth suddenly tightened and his eyes fell yes mister montgomery you are aware sir that i need only one more session to complete my course
10479,8838-298545-0014.flac,but after a time he had grown callous to it and accepted it as it was meant but this was something different it was insolence brutal overbearing insolence with physical menace behind it what name he asked coldly
10480,8838-298545-0021.flac,i'm sorry i hit you so hard said montgomery apologetically thou hit me hard i could stand such fly flappin all day twas this here press to crack my pate for me and thou art a looky man to be able to boast as thou hast outed me
10481,8838-298545-0039.flac,you may take it fom me that he's a slaughterer said the horse breaker you've taught him a lesson that he needed for it was always a word in a blow with him and the word alone was worth five shilling in a public court he won't be so ready now to shake his nief in the face of every one he meets
10482,8838-298545-0041.flac,but why because ted balton was to have fought him next saturday he was the champion of the wilson col pits and the other was the master of the iron folk down at the croxley smelters we'd matched our men for a purse of a hundred against the master
10483,8838-298545-0029.flac,a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty if he's an ounce well the master doesn't scale much more than that a hundred and seventy five that was when he was hogfat and living high work the greese out of him and i lay there's no great difference between them
10484,8838-298545-0011.flac,he only excelled in his strength and where was he to find a customer for that but the ways of fate are strange and his customer was at hand look yere said a voice at the door montgomery looked up
10485,8838-298545-0042.flac,but you've queered our man and he can't face such a battle with a two inch cut at the back of his head there's only one thing to be done sir
10486,8838-298545-0034.flac,and now i must really beg that you will have the goodness to tell me what is the matter they all sat down in their serious business like way that's easy done mister montgomery said the fat voiced publican but before saying anything we had to wait and see whether
10487,8838-298545-0018.flac,had enough asked the assistant breathing fiercely through his nose but no answer came the man was insensible and then the danger of his position came upon montgomery and he turned as white as his antagonist
10488,8838-298545-0050.flac,thou'll rise in one day from being just a common doctor to the best known mon twixt here and broadford thou art a wither and tyke thou art and no mistake and if thou beat the master of croxley thou'll find all the beer thou want for the rest of thy life waiting for thee at the four sacks
10489,8838-298545-0028.flac,no it's off it's not stand oop lad let's see the's standin it was the publican who spoke montgomery obeyed he would learn all about it no doubt if he were patient
10490,8838-298545-0019.flac,a sunday the immaculate doctor oldacre with his pious connection a savage brawl with a patient he would irretrievably lose his situation if the facts came out it was not much of a situation but he could not get another without a reference
10491,8838-298545-0049.flac,i am afraid the doctor would never consent to my going in fact i am sure that he would not but he need never know not before the fight at any rate we are not bound to give the name of our man so long as he is within the weight limits on the day of the fight that is all that concerns anyone
10492,8838-298545-0037.flac,you remember the man whom you knocked out this morning he is barton the famous tad barton i'm sure sir you may well be proud to have outed him in one round said the publican why it took morris the ten stone six champion
10493,8838-298545-0001.flac,upheld the lowering dun coloured cloud bank for six days in the week they spouted smoke but to day the furnaced fires were banked for it was sunday sordid and polluting gloom hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man
10494,8838-298545-0045.flac,all he wanted to complete his education was lying there ready to his hand if only that hand were strong enough to pick it up he had thought bitterly that morning that there was no market for his strength
10495,8838-298545-0009.flac,consider sir how many thousands of medical students there are in this country no doubt there are many of them who have a difficulty in finding their fees am i to provide for them all or why should i make an exception in your favor i am grieved and disappointed mister montgomery
10496,8838-298545-0044.flac,for a moment the absurdity of the thing drove every other thought out of montgomery's head
10497,8838-298545-0016.flac,look here said he turning round to the miner your medicine will be made up in its turn and sent down to you i don't allow folk in the surgery wait outside in the waiting room if you wish to wait at all young man said the miner
10498,8838-298545-0007.flac,i am afraid that my duties call me elsewhere mister montgomery one moment sir i had hope sir that perhaps if i signed a paper promising you interest upon your money you would advance the sum to me i will pay you back sir i really will or
10499,8838-298545-0015.flac,the provocation was so gross the insult so unprovoked that he could have none of those qualms which take the edge off a man's metal he finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack
10500,8838-298545-0038.flac,a deal more trouble than that before he put barton to sleep you've done a fine performance sir and happen you'l do a finer if you give yourself the chance i never heard of ted barton beyond seeing the name on a medicine label said the assistant well
10501,8838-298545-0000.flac,he sat in silence with his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his hands outside through the grimy surgery window over a foreground of blackened brick and slate a line of enormous chimneys like cyclopean pillars
10502,8838-298545-0052.flac,then you'll want a sparring partner oglevy has been acting for barton but we don't think that he is class enough barton bears you no grudge he's a good hearted fellow though cross grained with strangers he looked upon you as a stranger this morning but he says he knows you now
10503,8838-298545-0047.flac,it would be a very sporting thing of you mister montgomery if you would come to our help when we were in such a hole of course you might not like to take the hundred pounds but i have no doubt that in the case of your winning we could arrange that it should take the form of a watch or a piece of plate
10504,8838-298545-0032.flac,then with his other hand on his wrist he bent the forearm sharply and felt the biceps as round and hard as a cricket ball spring up under his fingers feel that said he the publican and horse breaker felt it with an air of reverence
10505,8838-298545-0026.flac,and down for the easter vacation for magdaleene college he sat now upon the edge of the surgery table looking in thoughtful silence at montgomery and twisting the ends of his small black waxed moustache the second was pervis the publican
10506,8838-298545-0022.flac,and now i'd be obliged to thee if thou wilt give me to wife's medicine montgomery gladly made it up and handed it to the miner you are weak still said he won't you stay a while and rest to wife wants of medicine
10507,8838-298545-0025.flac,above all what they could expect from him was a most inexplicable problem the first was sorley wilson the son of the owner of the nomperal colpet who was a young blood of twenty heir to a fortune a keen sportsman
10508,8838-298545-0036.flac,said the university man in a genial voice we've begun at the wrong end i know but we'll soon straighten it out
10509,8838-298545-0024.flac,yet all day he was aware of a sense of vague uneasiness which sharpened into dismay when late in the afternoon he was informed that three gentlemen had called and were waiting for him in the surgery at coroner's inquest
10510,8838-298545-0008.flac,if you like i will work it off after i am qualified the doctor's lips had thinned into a narrow line his eyes were raised again and sparkled indignantly your request is unreasonable mister montgomery
10511,8838-298546-0040.flac,you may find yourself molested by the blackguards whom it will attract i will take my chance of that sir said the assistant on the friday night which was the last night before the fight
10512,8838-298546-0030.flac,but as the visiting was done on foot and considerable distances had to be traversed it was a training in itself for the rest he punched the swinging ball and worked with the dumb bells for an hour every morning and evening and boxed twice a day with ted barton in the gymnasium
10513,8838-298546-0050.flac,to master is blind o the left eye nonsense it's true sir not stone blind but rarely fogged he keeps it secret but mother knows and so do i if thou slip him on the left side he can't cop thee they'll find it right as i tell thee
10514,8838-298546-0045.flac,she fair scrottled the face off a popman that had brought him a gallon from to checkers they say the hussy is his sparrin partner as well as the sweetheart and that his poor wife has just breakin her heart over it hullo youngin what do yo want
10515,8838-298546-0004.flac,i am informed that a two ounce glove is an evasion by which they dodge the law and make it difficult for the police to interfere
10516,8838-298546-0019.flac,the master adapted the style of his fighting to his physical disabilities and resumed his career of victory defeating norton the black hobby wilson and leve i cohen the latter a heavy weight conceting two stone he fought a draw with the famous billy mac coire
10517,8838-298546-0032.flac,ah that's better mon that's fine he would add as his opponent lifted him across the room on the end of a right counter that's how i likes to feel em happen thou'll pull through yet he chuckled with joy when montgomery knocked him into a corner
10518,8838-298546-0014.flac,i'll take this with me said montgomery and putting the paper into his pocket he returned home it was not a cheering record which he read there the whole history of the croxley master was given in full his many victories his few defeats
10519,8838-298546-0023.flac,there was age twenty three against forty there was an old ring proverb that youth will be served but the annals of the ring offer a great number of exceptions a hard veteran full of cool valor and ringcraft
10520,8838-298546-0031.flac,gaining as much profit as could be got from a rushing two handed slogger barton was full of admiration for his cleverness and quickness but doubtful about his strength hard hitting was the feature of his own style and he exacted it from others
10521,8838-298546-0003.flac,matched against a pugilist over at croxley i cannot understand why the law does not step in and stop so degrading an exhibition it is really a prize fight a glove fight you said
10522,8838-298546-0018.flac,it was owing to this that he was defeated in several rounds by willocks the man whom he had previously beaten and afterwards by james shaw of london though the latter acknowledged that he had fought the toughest customer of his career undismayed by his reverses
10523,8838-298546-0049.flac,for we want him to far bray him oh you want the master fair bray do you so do we well what have you to say is this your monsir well suppose it is then it's him i want to tell about it
10524,8838-298546-0022.flac,no light matter this which he had undertaken no battle with a rough and tumble fighter who presumed upon a local reputation the man's records showed that he was first class or nearly so there were a few points in his favor and he must make the most of them
10525,8838-298546-0006.flac,the doctor's sermon would have had more effect if the assistant had not once or twice had occasion to test his highest and come upon it at unexpectedly humble elevations it is always so particularly easy to
10526,8838-298546-0025.flac,that he might be remiss in his training and refused to abandon his usual way of life if he thought that he had an easy task before him in a man of his age and habits this seemed very possible montgomery prayed that it might be so
10527,8838-298546-0005.flac,to think that such scenes can be enacted within a few miles of our peaceful home but you will realize mister montgomery that while there are such influences for us to counteract it is very necessary that we should live up to our highest
10528,8838-298546-0013.flac,broke his leg has he yes an it's said badly they call him old ky behind his back for that is how his two legs look but his arms well if they was both stropped to a bench as the sayin is
10529,8838-298546-0041.flac,he's simply ripping said the undergraduate
10530,8838-298546-0011.flac,and so the croxley herald has his life an record and here it is and thou canst read it for thyself the sheet of the paper which he held up was a lake of print around an islet of illustration the latter was a coarse woodcut of a pugilist's head and neck
10531,8838-298546-0017.flac,who fought at tin stone two at the time had the better of fifteen rattling rounds and gained an award on points against the midlander having disposed of james dunn of rotherheith cameron of glasgow and a youth named ferney
10532,8838-298546-0052.flac,how came you to know so much who are you i'm his son sir wilson whistled and who sent you to us my mother i mant get back to her again take this half crown no sir i don't seek money an comming here
10533,8838-298546-0026.flac,meanwhile if his opponent were the best man who ever jumped the ropes into a ring his own duty was clear he must prepare himself carefully throw away no chance and do the very best that he could but he knew enough to appreciate the difference which exists in boxing as in every sport
10534,8838-298546-0020.flac,who may wish to learn the difference between a bar room scramble and a scientific contest the latest of these ambitious souls comes from the wilson coal pits which have undertaken to put up a stake of one hundred pounds and back their local champion
10535,8838-298546-0007.flac,compound for sins were most inclined to by damning those we have no mind to in any case montgomery felt that of all the men concerned in such a fight promoters backers spectators it is the actual fighter
10536,8838-298546-0039.flac,a very interesting relic of the early norman era by the way there is one objection which i see to your going to croxley on saturday it is upon that date as i am informed that the ruffianly glove fight takes place
10537,8838-298546-0033.flac,these causeless whims and fancies are very much to be deprecated mister montgomery consider how many there are to whom these very potatoes and this very beer would be most acceptable no doubt sir but at present i prefer to do without them
10538,8838-298546-0048.flac,i wanted to tell yer mon somethin o boot to master we've no time to listen to gossip my boy we know all about the master but thou dorn't sir nobody knows but me and mother and we thought as we'd like thy mon to know sir
10539,8838-298546-0043.flac,he kept poking his finger into montgomery as if he were one of his horses i hear that the master will scale a hundred and sixty odd at the ring side but there's some of that which he'd like well to put off and leave behind with his shirt said pervis
10540,8838-298546-0027.flac,between the amateur and the professional the coolness the power of hitting above all the capability of taking punishment count for so much those specially developed gutta perchalike abdominal muscles of the hardened pugilist
10541,8838-298546-0044.flac,i hear they've had a rare job to get him to drop his beer and if it had not been for that great red headed winch of his
10542,8838-298546-0028.flac,will take without flinching a blow which would leave another man writhing on the ground such things are not to be acquired in a week but all that could be done in a week should be done the medical assistant had a good basis to start from
10543,8838-298546-0047.flac,see here thou yun welp this is private an we want none o thy spyin but i mon speak to mister wilson the young cantab stepped forward well my lad what is it
10544,8838-298546-0053.flac,i do it for love suggested the publican for hate said the boy and darted off into the darkness seems to me the red headed wench may do him more harm than good after all remarked the publican
10545,8838-298546-0008.flac,who holds the strongest and most honourable position his conscience gave him no concern upon the subject endurance and courage are virtues not vices and brutality is at least better than effeminacy
10546,8838-298546-0015.flac,born in eighteen fifty seven said the provincial biographer silence craggs better known in sporting circles as the master of croxley is now in his fortieth year hang it i'm only twenty three
10547,8838-298546-0036.flac,of course if you insist upon your former rights there is no more to be said mister montgomery though i feel that it shows a certain indifference to my comfort and the welfare of the practice do you still insist yes sir very good have your way
10548,8838-298546-0029.flac,tall enough for anything on two legs as the old ringmen used to say lithe and spare with the activity of a panther and a strength which had hardly yet ever found its limitations his muscular development was finely hard
10549,8838-298546-0035.flac,you will remember doctor oldacre that when i came to you it was understood that i should have a clear day every month i have never claimed one but now there are reasons why i wish to have a holiday upon saturday doctor oldacre gave in with a very bad grace
10550,8838-298546-0024.flac,could give ten or fifteen years and a beating to most stripplings he could not rely too much upon his advantage in age but then there was the lameness that must surely count for a great deal and lastly there was the chance that the master might underrate his opponent
10551,8838-298546-0016.flac,and won the proud title which he still holds ambitious of a more than local fame he secured a patron and fought his first fight against jack barton of birmingham in may eighteen eighty at the old loiterer's club craggs
10552,8838-298546-0000.flac,it was true that his teacher was long past his prime slow upon his feet and stiff in his joints but even so he was still a tough antagonist but montgomery had found at last that he could more than hold his own with him he had won the university metal and his teacher
10553,8838-298546-0038.flac,in the country yes sir you are very wise you will find a quiet day among the wild flowers a very valuable restorative have you thought about any particular direction i am going over croxley way
10554,8838-298546-0010.flac,the little man could hardly articulate in his astonishment why sir he's the first mon of the district on his name as well known in the west writing as the winner of to derby but law sir here he stopped and rummaged among a heap of papers
10555,8838-298546-0009.flac,the assistant strolled down there after tea and asked in a casual way whether the tobacconist had ever heard of the master of croxley
10556,8838-298546-0034.flac,i should do a double day's work on friday so as to leave everything in order i should hope to be back in the evening i am afraid i cannot spare you mister montgomery this was a facer if he could not get leave he would go without it
10557,8838-298546-0012.flac,silas craggs and beneath the master of croxley thou'll find all about him there sir said the tobacconist he's a witherin tike he is and we're proud to have him in the county if he hadn't broke his leg he'd ave been champion of england
10558,8838-298546-0037.flac,a quiet resolution in his voice as he claimed his saturday which aroused his curiosity i have no desire to interfere unduly with your affairs mister montgomery but were you thinking of having a day leads upon saturday no sir

10626,5514-19193-0024.flac,this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful to gavroche beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size

10637,5514-19193-0027.flac,for thirst said he putting it in his pocket by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade became transparent so that the sharp shooters of the line ranged on the outlook behind their paving stone dike
10638,5514-19193-0009.flac,the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery another cannonade was audible at some distance at the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the rue de la chanvrerie

10641,5514-19193-0014.flac,and he shouted fire on the artillery men all were ready the barricade which had long been silent poured forth a desperate fire seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of rage and joy

10645,5514-19193-0030.flac,it was a charming and terrible sight gavroche though shot at was teasing the fusillade he had the air of being greatly diverted it was the sparrow pecking at the sportsman to each discharge he retorted with a couplet
10646,5514-19193-0010.flac,the four cannons echoed each other mournfully the barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other
10647,5514-19193-0021.flac,it will be remembered that fannico's company had left behind it a trail of bodies twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street twenty cartoushes for gavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade
10648,5514-19193-0023.flac,it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was
10649,5514-19193-0018.flac,courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine shop had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying
10650,5514-19193-0011.flac,the other balls the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents mingled with bursts of grape shot

10655,8095-274346-0047.flac,and to show some degree of precipitancy and indiscretion moved by this example the house of peers were roused from their inactivity and claimed liberty for the earl of arandel who had been lately confined in the tower

10664,8095-274346-0057.flac,of which they intended to take advantage to such deep perfidy to such unbounded usurpations it was necessary to oppose a proper firmness and resolution
10665,8095-274346-0020.flac,but his urgent necessities obliged him to submit
10666,8095-274346-0052.flac,while they retained such a pledge besides the supply already promised they were sure that nothing could be refused them though after canvassing the matter near three months they found themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke
10667,8095-274346-0034.flac,a certain proof that a discovery of this nature was not as is imagined by several historians
10668,8095-274346-0019.flac,and if the king either cut them short in this undertaking or refused compliance with their demands he must not expect any supply from the commons great dissatisfaction was expressed by charles at a treatment which he deemed so harsh and undutiful

10673,8095-274346-0050.flac,so violent was the bigotry of the times that it was thought a sufficient reason for disqualifying any one from holding an office
10674,8095-274346-0024.flac,and in these he was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection when the parliament was summoned charles by a stretch of prerogative had given orders that no writ as is customary should be sent to bristol
10675,8095-274346-0035.flac,the king seemed desirous of embracing every opportunity by which he could express a contempt and disregard for them no one was at that time sufficiently sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in the balance of the constitution
10676,8095-274346-0056.flac,without waiting for new incidents without covering themselves with new pretences they immediately deserted him and refused him all reasonable supply it was evident that they desired nothing so much as to see him plunged in inextricable difficulties

10682,8095-274346-0043.flac,these imprudent suggestions rather gave warning than struck terror a precarious liberty the commons thought which was to be preserved by unlimited complaisance was no liberty at all and it was necessary while yet in their power
10683,8095-274346-0044.flac,to secure the constitution by such invincible barriers that no king or minister should ever for the future dare to speak such a language to any parliament or even entertain such a project against them
10684,8095-274346-0051.flac,this article together with the new impositions laid on merchandise by james constituted near half of the crown revenues and by depriving the king of these resources they would have reduced him to total subjection and dependence
10685,8095-274346-0023.flac,but finding them all fruitless and observing charles to be entirely governed by buckingham his implacable enemy he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court a new spirit he saw and a new power arising in the nation
10686,8095-274346-0042.flac,which bringeth such happiness to this nation and makes us envied of all others while there is this sweetness between his majesty and the commons lest we lose the repute of a free people by our turbulency in parliament
10687,8095-274346-0030.flac,and of administering physic to the late king without acquainting his physicians all these articles appear from comparing the accusation and reply to be either frivolous or false or both
10688,8095-274346-0041.flac,they by little and little began to stand on their prerogatives and at last overthrew the parliaments throughout christendom
10689,8095-274346-0025.flac,that nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition and craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due as a peer of the realm his writ was sent him but accompanied with a letter from the lord keeper coventry
10690,8095-274346-0045.flac,the commons immediately declared that they would proceed no further upon business till they had satisfaction in their privileges charles alleged as the reason of this measure certain seditious expressions which he said had in their accusation of the duke
10691,8095-274346-0048.flac,after many fruitless evasions the king
10692,8095-274346-0017.flac,the supply was only voted by the commons the passing of that vote into a law was reserved till the end of the session a condition was thereby made in a very undisguised manner with their sovereign
10693,8095-274346-0001.flac,though a determined protestant by principle as well as inclination he had entertained no violent horror against popery and a little humanity he thought was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors
10694,8095-274346-0009.flac,the army was landed and a fort taken but the undisciplined soldiers finding store of wine could not be restrained from the utmost excesses further stay appearing fruitless they were re embarked and the fleet put to sea
10695,8095-274346-0016.flac,the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the occasion and ill fitted to promote those views of success and glory for which the young prince in his first enterprise so ardently longed but this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one
10696,8095-274346-0002.flac,an abatement of the more rigorous laws was all he intended and his engagements with france notwithstanding that their regular execution had never been promised or expected required of him some indulgence
10697,8095-274346-0005.flac,they petitioned the king for replacing such able clergy as had been silenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies they also enacted laws for the strict observance of sunday which the puritans affected to call the sabbath
10698,8095-274346-0011.flac,was obliged again to have recourse to a parliament though the ill success of his enterprises diminished his authority and showed every day more plainly the imprudence of the spanish war though the increase of his necessities
10699,8095-274346-0004.flac,the extreme rage against popery was a sure characteristic of puritanism the house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party
10700,8095-274346-0012.flac,rendered him more dependent and more exposed to the encroachments of the commons he was resolved to try once more that regular and constitutional expedient for supply perhaps too a little political art which at that time he practised
10701,8095-274346-0013.flac,was much trusted to he had named four popular leaders sheriffs of counties sir edward coke sir robert phillips sir thomas wentworth and sir francis seymour and though the question had been formerly much contested
10702,8095-274346-0006.flac,and which they sanctified by the most melancholy indolence it is to be remarked that the different appellations of this festival were at that time known symbols of the different parties
10703,8095-274346-0007.flac,the king finding that the parliament was resolved to grant him no supply and would furnish him with nothing but empty protestations of duty
10704,8095-274346-0008.flac,was intrusted with the command he sailed immediately for catis and found the bay full of spanish ships of great value he either neglected to attack these ships or attempted it preposterously
10705,8095-274346-0003.flac,but so unfortunate was this prince that no measure embraced during his whole reign was ever attended with more unhappy and more fatal consequences
10706,8095-274346-0014.flac,he thought that he had by that means incapacitated them from being elected members but his intention being so evident rather put the commons more upon their guard
10707,8095-274346-0015.flac,enow of patriots still remain to keep up the ill humor of the house and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recommend to them practices
10708,8095-274346-0000.flac,charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances he was however in his heart extremely averse to these furious measures
10709,8095-274346-0010.flac,with an intention of intercepting the spanish galleons but the plague having seized the seamen and soldiers they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this prize and return to england loud complaints were made against the court for entrusting so important a command
10710,8095-274348-0015.flac,and both of them entrusted to the command of the duke who was altogether unacquainted both with land and sea service the fleet appeared before rochelle but so ill concerted were buckingham's measures that the inhabitants of that city
10711,8095-274348-0002.flac,seems to have been encouraged by the princess and the duke presumed so far on her good graces that after his departure he secretly returned upon some pretence and paying a visit to the queen
10712,8095-274348-0005.flac,entirely disposed to gaiety and gallantry the cardinal's disappointment strongly inclined him to counterwork the amorous projects of his rival when the duke was making preparations for a new embassy to paris
10713,8095-274348-0003.flac,was dismissed with a reproof which savored more of kindness than of anger information of this correspondence was soon carried to richene the vigilance of that minister was here further roused by jealousy
10714,8095-274348-0013.flac,the power of france freed from this impediment would soon become formidable to england and to all the neighboring nations though charles probably bore but small favour to the hugonots who so much resembled the puritans in discipline and worship
10715,8095-274348-0012.flac,and considered him as a prince engaged by interest as well as inclination to support them that so long as their party subsisted charles might rely on their attachment as much as on that of his own subjects but if their liberties were once ravished from them
10716,8095-274348-0010.flac,after peace was concluded with the french king under charles's mediation the ambitious cardinal was still meditating the destruction of the hugonots that preparations were silently making in every province of france for the suppression of their religion
10717,8095-274348-0006.flac,a message was sent him from lewis that he must not think of such a journey in a romantic passion he swore that he would see the queen in spite of all the power of france
10718,8095-274348-0011.flac,that forts were erected in order to bridle rochelle the most considerable bulwark of the protestants that the reformed in france cast their eyes on charles as the head of their faith
10719,8095-274348-0017.flac,hastened the vengeance of their master exhausted their provisions in supplying their allies and were threatened with an immediate siege
10720,8095-274348-0000.flac,and who from a private station had mounted in the earliest youth
10721,8095-274348-0001.flac,he dared to carry his ambitious addresses to the queen herself and he failed not to make impression on a heart not undisposed to the tender passions that attachment at least of the mind which appears so delicious and is so dangerous
10722,8095-274348-0008.flac,contrary to the articles of the marriage treaty he encouraged the english ships of war and privateers to seize vessels belonging to french merchants
10723,8095-274348-0016.flac,shut their gates and refused to admit allies of whose coming they were not previously informed
10724,8095-274348-0014.flac,in religion and politics he yet allowed himself to be gained by these arguments enforced by the solicitations of buckingham a fleet of a hundred sail and an army of seven thousand men were fitted out for the invasion of france
10725,8095-274348-0007.flac,and from that moment he determined to engage england in a war with that kingdom he first took advantage of some quarrels excited by the queen of england's attendants and he persuaded charles to dismiss at once all her french servants
10726,8095-274348-0009.flac,and strongly solicited charles to embrace the protection of these distressed religionists he represented that after the inhabitants of rochelle had been repressed by the combined squadrons of england and holland
10727,8095-274348-0004.flac,he too either from vanity or politics had ventured to pay his addresses to the queen but a priest past middle age of a severe character and occupied in the most extensive plans of ambition or vengeance
10728,8095-274345-0033.flac,men of such aspiring geniuses and such independent fortunes could not long deliberate they boldly embraced the side of freedom and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prince without extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty
10729,8095-274345-0006.flac,they were sensible that the present war was very lately the result of their own importunate applications and entreaties and that they had solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the management of it
10730,8095-274345-0003.flac,he lightly mentioned the occasion which he had for supply he employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of the members he would not even allow the officers of the crown who had seats in the house
10731,8095-274345-0035.flac,are in continual fluctuation it was as natural in their opinion and allowable for popular assemblies to take advantage of favorable incidents in order to secure the subject
10732,8095-274345-0004.flac,and that great anticipations were likewise made on the revenues of the crown they were not ignorant that charles was loaded with a large debt contracted by his father who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from foreign princes
10733,8095-274345-0027.flac,though it must be remarked that the connections with that crown were much less obnoxious to the protestants and less agreeable to the catholics then the alliance formerly projected with spain and were therefore received rather with pleasure than dissatisfaction
10734,8095-274345-0024.flac,in order to fortify himself against the resentment of james buckingham had effected popularity and entered into the cabales of the puritans but being secure of the confidence of charles he had since abandoned this party
10735,8095-274345-0020.flac,the nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of taxes and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting their sovereign even elizabeth notwithstanding her vigour and frugality
10736,8095-274345-0031.flac,it would be impossible they thought when all these pretensions were methodized and prosecuted by the increasing knowledge of the age to maintain any shadow of popular government in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign
10737,8095-274345-0022.flac,would not augment their number in the same proportion the puritanical party though disguised had a great authority over the kingdom and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that sect
10738,8095-274345-0007.flac,they were acquainted with the difficulty of military enterprises directed against the whole house of austria against the king of spain possessed of the greatest riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in europe
10739,8095-274345-0032.flac,it was necessary to fix a choice either to abandon entirely the privileges of the people or to secure them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitution had hitherto provided for them in this dilemma
10740,8095-274345-0026.flac,the match with france and the articles in favor of catholics which were suspected to be in the treaty were likewise causes of disgust to this whole party
10741,8095-274345-0008.flac,against the emperor ferdinand hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age who had subdued and astonished germany by the rapidity of his victories deep impressions they saw must be made by the english sword
10742,8095-274345-0009.flac,and a vigorous offensive war bewaged against these mighty potentates ere they would resign a principality which they had now fully subdued and which they held in secure possession by its being surrounded with all their other territories
10743,8095-274345-0021.flac,and the necessary wars in which she was engaged had reason to complain of the commons in this particular nor could the authority of that princess which was otherwise almost absolute ever extort from them the requisite supplies
10744,8095-274345-0005.flac,they had learned by experience that the public revenue could with difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown even under the ordinary charges of government
10745,8095-274345-0016.flac,fickle in his friendships all men were either regarded as his enemies or dreaded soon to become such the whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his insatiable hand while he both engrossed the entire confidence of his master
10746,8095-274345-0001.flac,and which lay at that time under prorogation but being told that this measure would appear unusual he issued writz for summoning a new parliament on the seventh of may and it was not without regret that the arrival of the princess henrietta
10747,8095-274345-0028.flac,as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in prosecution of them among these we may mention the names of sir edward cope sir edwin sans sir robert phillips sir francis seymour
10748,8095-274345-0002.flac,unexperienced and impolitic regarded as sincere all the praises and caresses with which he had been loaded while active in procuring the rupture with the house of austria and besides that he labored under great necessities
10749,8095-274345-0012.flac,which the present conjuncture could suggest to them it is not to be doubted but spleen and ill will against the duke of buckingham had an influence with many so vast and rapid a fortune so little merited
10750,8095-274345-0029.flac,sir dudley diggs sir john elliot sir thomas wentworth mister seldon and mister pimm animated with a warm regard to liberty
10751,8095-274345-0019.flac,succeeded to all the passions and principles of their predecessors we ought rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the kingdom during that whole period than from any circumstances which attended this particular conjuncture
10752,8095-274345-0025.flac,and on that account was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment though the religious schemes of many of the puritans when explained appear pretty frivolous we are not thence to imagine that they were pursued by none but persons of weak understandings
10753,8095-274345-0011.flac,the house of commons conducted by the wisest and ablest senators that had ever flourished in england thought proper to confer on the king a supply of two subsidies
10754,8095-274345-0018.flac,the last parliament of james amidst all their joy and festivity had given him a supply very disproportioned to his demand and to the occasion and as every house of commons which was elected during forty years
10755,8095-274345-0015.flac,his vehement temper prompted him to raise suddenly to the highest elevation his flatterers and dependence and upon the least occasion of displeasure he threw them down with equal impetuosity and violence implacable in his hatred
10756,8095-274345-0014.flac,his influence over the modesty of charles exceeded even that which he had acquired over the weakness of james nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel and direction
10757,8095-274345-0023.flac,all these were disgusted with the court both by the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty essential to their party and on account of the restraint under which they were held by the established hierarchy
10758,8095-274345-0013.flac,could not fail to excite public envy and however men's hatred might have been suspended for a moment while the duke's conduct seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices it was impossible for him long to preserve the affections of the people
10759,8095-274345-0017.flac,and held invested in his single person the most considerable offices of the crown however the ill humor of the commons might have been increased by these considerations we are not to suppose them the sole motives
10760,8095-274345-0030.flac,of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass though their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and precedents favorable to kingly power and had been able notwithstanding to preserve some small remains of liberty
10761,8095-274345-0034.flac,the end they esteemed beneficent and noble the means regular and constitutional to grant or refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons and as all human governments particularly those of a mixed frame
10762,8095-274345-0010.flac,to answer therefore all these great and important ends to satisfy their young king in the first request which he made them to prove their sense of the many royal virtues particularly economy with which charles was endued
10763,8095-274345-0000.flac,no sooner had charles taken into his hands the reigns of government than he showed an impatience to assemble the great council of the nation and he would gladly for the sake of despatch have called together the same parliament which had sitten under his father
10764,6081-42010-0017.flac,at the same time casting the blame on his own impatience and lack of caution
10765,6081-42010-0028.flac,and the magistrate finding that this last thrust had failed to produce any effect gave up the fight in despair he rang the bell and ordered the guard to conduct the witness back to prison
10766,6081-42010-0035.flac,no or i don't know and retracted everything she had previously stated to lecoq she swore that she had been misunderstood that her words had been misconstrued
10767,6081-42010-0031.flac,it is quite impossible to get her to speak she loves that rascal intensely and he has a wonderful influence over her you heard what he said he threatened her with death if she breathed a word about lacheneur
10768,6081-42010-0027.flac,as these words fell in polyte's ears it was evidence his impudence and indifference had received a severe shock he seemed confounded and hung his head as if thoroughly abashed still he preserved an obstinate silence
10769,6081-42010-0011.flac,he ordered her to leave the room at once but the poor creature was quite overcome and trembled like a leaf her eyes were fixed upon her unworthy husband and the happiness she felt at seeing him again shone plainly in her anxious gaze
10770,6081-42010-0032.flac,and she is so terrified that there is no hope of making her speak
10771,6081-42010-0037.flac,but remember that your strange silence injures your husband far more than anything you could say she left the room or rather she rushed wildly from it as though only too eager to escape
10772,6081-42010-0021.flac,i influence her evidence i don't understand you but for that supposition your words would have been meaningless what words the magistrate turned to his clerk
10773,6081-42010-0013.flac,and lifting her with his strong arms carried her out into the passage the whole scene had been so brief
10774,6081-42010-0026.flac,be guided by me confess everything while there is yet time and abandon the present course which may lead you into serious danger one may be an accomplice in more ways than one
10775,6081-42010-0022.flac,read the last remark you took down in a monotonous voice the smiling clerk repeated i should like to kill the person who dared to say that i knew lacheneur
10776,6081-42010-0012.flac,just for one second and then she caught his withering glance and heard his words of menace terror stricken she staggered back and then lecoq seized her round the waist
10777,6081-42010-0030.flac,but i thought you would be waiting for me and made haste to bring her here i thought i was acting for the best never mind the misfortune can be repaired no sir no since she has seen her husband
10778,6081-42010-0025.flac,do you suppose the police are ignorant of your acquaintance with lacheneur of your conversation with him when he came in a cab to the corner of the waste ground near your mother's wineshop and of the hopes of fortune you based upon his promises
10779,6081-42010-0016.flac,and word for word if you please he paused the door opened again this time to admit the magistrate's messenger who timidly and with a rather guilty air
10780,6081-42010-0023.flac,what did you mean by that it's very easy to understand sir
10781,6081-42010-0034.flac,polyte's threat had aroused the most sinister apprehensions in her mind not understanding his connection with the affair she asked herself if her testimony might not prove his death warrant
10782,6081-42010-0024.flac,don't prevaricate any longer he said you certainly ordered your wife not to say anything about lacheneur that's evident why did you do so what are you afraid of her telling us
10783,6081-42010-0029.flac,and to take every precaution to prevent him seeing his wife again when polyte had departed lecoq re entered the room
10784,6081-42010-0015.flac,ah ah thought the smiling clerk in a flutter of delight this is something new but as these little diversions never made him forget his duties he leaned toward the magistrate and asked
10785,6081-42010-0036.flac,at last she burst into wild despairing sobs and pressed her frightened child against her breast what could be done to overcome this foolish obstinacy as blind and unreasoning as a brute's
10786,6081-42010-0033.flac,again set foot in his office the poor creature seemed nearly heartbroken
10787,6081-42010-0018.flac,yet obtaining the information he desired let us proceed he said to polyte who had not moved since his wife had been taken from the room
10788,6081-42010-0014.flac,was still forming the order for toinon to be removed from the room when he found the door closed again
10789,6081-42010-0019.flac,being to all appearances sublimely indifferent to everything passing around him to the magistrate's proposal he carelessly nodded assent was that your wife who came in just now
10790,6081-42010-0020.flac,why did you behave in that manner it wasn't the time for sentiment you are not telling the truth you simply desired to attract her attention to influence her evidence i
10791,6081-42010-0001.flac,and dependent on the customers it brought them being of a conscientious turn of mind he entered each establishment in succession and meeting now and again various acquaintances he felt compelled to proffer and accept
10792,6081-42010-0007.flac,was he not bringing with him the most potent of justifications he thought of the agreeable surprise he had in store for the magistrate and fancied he could picture the sudden brightening of that functionary's gloomy face
10793,6081-42010-0002.flac,numerous glances of the favorite morning beverage white wine turn which way he would however loiter as long as he might
10794,6081-42010-0010.flac,he instantly perceived his mistake and understood its consequences there was only one thing to be done he must prevent any exchange of words between the two
10795,6081-42010-0005.flac,that he delivered the order for lecoq to follow him without a minute's delay
10796,6081-42010-0008.flac,and yet fate so willed it that the doorkeeper's message and his urgent appeal that lecoq should not loiter on the way produced the most unfortunate results
10797,6081-42010-0009.flac,when he saw however that the magistrate was not alone and when he recognized polyte chupin the original of the photograph
10798,6081-42010-0006.flac,has asked for you a number of times said he he has been extremely impatient and he is in a very bad humor so you may expect to have your head snapped off in the most expeditious manner lecoq smiled as he went up the stairs
10799,6081-42010-0000.flac,he first of all proceeded to the prefectur of police going the longest way round as a matter of course but on reaching his destination he could find no one who had seen the young detective accordingly
10800,6081-42010-0003.flac,he was returning in haste a trifle uneasy on account of the length of his absence when he perceived a cab pull up in front of the palais gateway a second glance and oh great good fortune he saw lecoq
10801,6081-42010-0004.flac,father absint and the virtuous toinon alight from this very vehicle his peace of mind at once returned and it was in a very important and somewhat husky tone
10802,6081-41997-0037.flac,but they were hurrying away as fast as they could in what direction oh they were running toward the rue de varen
10803,6081-41997-0038.flac,however he bowed civilly to the concierge whom he might possibly have need of at another time and then went back to the cab as i had supposed they do not live here he remarked to the driver
10804,6081-41997-0029.flac,the vehicle was now rolling along the rue de bourgone half way down the street the driver pulled up and turning to lecoq exclaimed here we are that's the house the hussies went into
10805,6081-41997-0030.flac,to draw off the silk handkerchief that served him as a muffler to fold it and slip it into his pocket to spring to the ground and enter the house indicated was only the work of an instant for the young detective
10806,6081-41997-0019.flac,you will have time to faint when we get home now come along and then she began to sob indeed madame indeed i can't she said and really she seemed quite unable to move in fact
10807,6081-41997-0026.flac,whether she was a blonde or brunette so many questions at a time confused the driver stop a minute he replied in my opinion she wasn't pretty and i don't believe she was young
10808,6081-41997-0003.flac,as soon as the vehicle was well under way the young detective proceeded to ingratiate himself into the driver's good graces being anxious to obtain all the information that this worthy was able to impart
10809,6081-41997-0028.flac,asked lecoq the neatly dressed one the deuce as for her i did not notice her at all all i know about her is that she was very small would you recognize her if you met her again good heavens no
10810,6081-41997-0017.flac,and which was it that said thee and thou
10811,6081-41997-0002.flac,a maxim intended to assure his after fame and which ran as follows always suspect that which seems probable and begin by believing what appears incredible
10812,6081-41997-0012.flac,but to listen to all he had to say as you may suppose continued the coachman i wasn't inclined to trust to such suspicious characters alone at that hour and in that part of the city
10813,6081-41997-0013.flac,so just as they were about to get into the cab i called to them wait a bit my little friends you have promised papa some sous where are they the one who had called after the cab at once handed me thirty francs
10814,6081-41997-0004.flac,in a tone that implied that all trifling would be useless the cabman cried hey up hey up cocotte and his mare pricked up her ears and quickened her pace so that the rue de choisie
10815,6081-41997-0023.flac,in reality social pre eminence belonged to the woman who had left the large broad footprints behind her and not merely was she of a superior rank but she had also shown superior energy
10816,6081-41997-0005.flac,was speedily reached then it was that lecoq resumed his inquiries well my good fellow he began you have told me the principal facts now i should like the details
10817,6081-41997-0035.flac,for fear of disturbing you yesterday i was so busy i couldn't come however here i am at last and here's the handkerchief so saying
10818,6081-41997-0032.flac,to which one really i don't exactly know in a moment the worthy dame imagined that this polite young man was making fun of her you scamp she began
10819,6081-41997-0036.flac,i slipped on my dress and went out into the hall where i saw two women hastening toward the door before i could reach them they slammed the door in my face i opened it again as quickly as i could and looked out into the street
10820,6081-41997-0021.flac,lecoq's first suppositions as he had suspected the social position of the two women was not the same he had been mistaken however
10821,6081-41997-0025.flac,had a hand as small as a child's and in spite of her anger her voice was as sweet as music did you see her face i just caught a glimpse of it
10822,6081-41997-0024.flac,contrary to lecoq's original idea it now seemed evident that she was the mistress and her companion the servant is that all my good fellow he asked the driver
10823,6081-41997-0018.flac,she with shabby dress and shoes as big as a gouty man's you should have seen her shake the prim looking girl as if she had been a palm tree you little fool said she do you want to ruin us
10824,6081-41997-0022.flac,in attributing the higher standing to the woman wearing the shoes with the high heels the marks of which he had so particularly noticed in the snow with all the attendant signs of precipitation terror and weakness
10825,6081-41997-0007.flac,i had been having a most unfortunate day six hours on a stand on the boulevard with the rain pouring all the time it was simply awful at midnight i had not made more than a franc and
10826,6081-41997-0016.flac,i did notice something strange one of the two women called the other madame as large as life while the other said thee and thou and spoke as if she were somebody
10827,6081-41997-0034.flac,overtook me and passed on one of them dropped this handkerchief which i picked up i hastened after her to restore it but before i could overtake them they had rung the bell at your door and were already in the house
10828,6081-41997-0015.flac,which ran after you the girl who was neatly dressed the one who the driver suddenly paused some vivid remembrance passed through his brain and abruptly jerking the reins
10829,6081-41997-0031.flac,in the concierge's little room he found an old woman knitting lecoq bowed to her politely and displaying the silk handkerchief exclaimed madame i have come to return this article to one of your lodgers
10830,6081-41997-0014.flac,saying above all make haste your recital could not be more minute exclaimed lecoq approvingly now how about these two women
10831,6081-41997-0001.flac,and yet he did not hesitate to jump on to the box and give the signal for starting in so doing he obeyed a maxim which he had
10832,6081-41997-0011.flac,a louis for yourself i hesitated for a moment when the woman added and ten francs for the fare i then drew up lecoq was boiling over with impatience but he felt that the wisest course was not to interrupt the driver with questions
10833,6081-41997-0008.flac,half for myself but i was so wet and miserable and the horse seemed so done up that i decided to go home i did grumble i can tell you well i had just passed the corner of the rue picar
10834,6081-41997-0010.flac,i had already passed them when they began to call after me i pretended i did not hear them but one of them ran after the cab crying
10835,6081-41997-0033.flac,excuse me interrupted lecoq allow me to finish i must tell you that at about three o'clock in the morning of the day before yesterday i was quietly returning home when two ladies who were seemingly in a great hurry
10836,6081-41997-0000.flac,hence the driver's hope of finding them in the rue des baurgans
10837,6081-41997-0006.flac,how did these two women attract your attention
10838,6081-41997-0020.flac,she appeared to be so ill that i said to myself here is a young woman who has drunk more than is good for her these facts confirmed even if they corrected
10839,6081-41997-0027.flac,but she certainly was a blonde and with plenty of hair too was she tall or short stout or slender between the two this was very vague and the other
10840,6081-41997-0009.flac,when i saw two women standing under a lamp some little distance off i did not pay any attention to them for when a man is as old as i am women go on said lecoq who could not restrain his impatience
10841,6081-41998-0026.flac,whom he could not perceive has gevroled intentionally or unintentionally failed to fulfil his promise
10842,6081-41998-0015.flac,that lecoq managed to effect an entrance as usual he found among the mob a large number of girls and women for strange to say
10843,6081-41998-0034.flac,suddenly i noticed that one of them turned as white as his shirt and calling the attention of his companions to one of the unknown victims he whispered gustave
10844,6081-41998-0033.flac,when at about nine o'clock three young men entered arm in arm from their manner and appearance i judged them to be clerks in some store or warehouse
10845,6081-41998-0043.flac,the man shook his head no said he
10846,6081-41998-0024.flac,revealing the ghastly tints of the lifeless flesh and imparting a sinister aspect to the tattered clothing hung around the room to aid in the identification of the corpses this clothing after a certain time is sold
10847,6081-41998-0031.flac,the keeper's face brightened up in that case said he i have a letter for you written by your comrade who was obliged to go away here it is the young detective at once tore open the envelope and read
10848,6081-41998-0005.flac,i prefer to alight here rather than in front of the morgue he said springing to the ground then producing first his watch and next his purse he added
10849,6081-41998-0042.flac,when finding a doorkeeper installed behind a heavy oaken desk he remarked
10850,6081-41998-0020.flac,for the mysterious murderer whose identity lecoq was trying to establish had furnished three victims for their delectation
10851,6081-41998-0022.flac,as a continuous accompaniment to the exclamations sighs and whispered comments of the bystanders came the murmur of the water trickling from a spigat at the head of each slab a tiny stream that flowed forth
10852,6081-41998-0039.flac,as the old coachman urged on his horse he could not refrain from saying things are going on to suit you a friendly hush was the only response
10853,6081-41998-0041.flac,lecoq had entered the left wing of the palais he climbed the stairs till he had reached the third floor and was about to enter the long narrow badly lighted corridor
10854,6081-41998-0013.flac,accordingly lecoq made a gesture of assent and then hurried toward the morgue if there was a crowd on the roadway outside it was because the gloomy building itself was crammed full of people indeed the sight seers
10855,6081-41998-0000.flac,when a mysterious crime has been perpetrated or a great catastrophe has happened and the identity of the victims has not been established a great day invariably follows at the morgue
10856,6081-41998-0016.flac,to the disgusting sights in horrible emotions that repay a visit to the morgue the shop and work girls who reside in the neighborhood readily go out of their way to catch a glimpse of the corpses
10857,6081-41998-0018.flac,may come no further than the door but the others enter and after a long stare return and recount their impressions to their less courageous companions if there should be no corpse exhibited
10858,6081-41998-0002.flac,exchanging jests well calculated to make an ordinary mortals flesh creep as a rule they are far less interested in the corpses laid out for public view on the marble slabs in the principal hall
10859,6081-41998-0006.flac,we have been an hour and forty minutes my good fellow consequently i owe you nothing at all replied the driver decidedly but no not a sou
10860,6081-41998-0001.flac,the attendants are so accustomed to the horrors of the place that the most sickly sight fails to impress them and even under the most distressing circumstances they hasten gaily to and fro
10861,6081-41998-0003.flac,as the vehicle conveying lecoq reached the quey
10862,6081-41998-0037.flac,in the meantime watching them out of the corner of my eye i send this note explaining my absence to the head keeper who will give it to you you will understand that i am going to follow these men a b
10863,6081-41998-0014.flac,most of whom could see nothing at all were packed as closely as sardines
10864,6081-41998-0035.flac,his comrades put their hands over his mouth and one of them exclaimed what are you about you fool to mix yourself up with this affair do you want to get us into trouble thereupon they went out and i followed them
10865,6081-41998-0009.flac,the magistrate will want your evidence and a summons will be sent you all right then address it to papillon eugene driver
10866,6081-41998-0028.flac,ever since opening we have had an immense crowd if i were master here on days like this i would charge an admission fee of two sous ahead
10867,6081-41998-0017.flac,which crime accident and suicide bring to this horrible place a few
10868,6081-41998-0007.flac,i am too worried already to think that i took the money these hussies offered me it would only have served me right if the liquor i bought with it had given me the gripes don't be uneasy about the score and if you need a trap use mine for nothing
10869,6081-41998-0021.flac,and yet a damp chill came from beyond the iron railings while from the crowd itself rose an infectious vapour impregnated with the stench of the chloride of lyme used as a disinfectant
10870,6081-41998-0029.flac,it would bring in a round sum more than enough to cover the expenses the keeper's reply seemed to offer an inducement to conversation but lecoq did not seize it
10871,6081-41998-0011.flac,you told me that you had another appointment and that you were already late yes i ought to be at the palais du giustice but it is only a few steps from here no matter
10872,6081-41998-0025.flac,for nothing is wasted at the morgue however lecoq was too occupied with his own thoughts to remark the horrors of the scene he scarcely bestowed a glance on the three victims
10873,6081-41998-0012.flac,i will wait for you at the corner of the bridge it's useless to say no i've made up my mind and i'm a breton you know
10874,6081-41998-0023.flac,only to fall in fine spray upon the marble through the small arched windows a gray light stole in on the exposed bodies bringing each muscle into bold relief
10875,6081-41998-0032.flac,monsieur lecoq monsieur this simple formula of politeness brought a faint smile to his lips
10876,6081-41998-0030.flac,but after a moment's hesitation he ventured to inquire are you one of them yes i am replied lecoq exhibiting his card in support of his assertion and your name
10877,6081-41998-0040.flac,who insisted upon remaining at his orders he succeeded at last however but even when he had reached the portico on the left side of the building
10878,6081-41998-0036.flac,but the person who had first spoken was so overcome that he could scarcely drag himself along and his companions were obliged to take him to a little restaurant close by i entered it myself and it is there i write this letter
10879,6081-41998-0038.flac,s the handwriting of this letter was almost illegible and there were mistakes in spelling in well nigh every line still its meaning was clear and exact and could not fail to excite the most flattering hopes
10880,6081-41998-0019.flac,if all the marble slabs are unoccupied strange as it may seem the visitors turn hastily away with an expression of disappointment or discontent there was no fear of their doing so however
10881,6081-41998-0004.flac,the newspapers had reported the tragedy at the widow chupin's drinking den of course more or less correctly and everybody wished to see the victims
10882,6081-41998-0008.flac,till you have caught the jades as lecoq's purse was low he did not insist you will at least take my name and address continued the driver certainly
10883,6081-41998-0010.flac,i lodge at his place because i have some small interest in the business you see the young detective was hastening away when papillon called him back when you leave the morgue you will want to go somewhere else he said
10884,6081-41998-0027.flac,unable to explain the cause of his comrade's absence lecoq addressed himself to the head keeper it would seem that no one has recognized the victims he remarked no one and yet
10885,8108-274318-0002.flac,to observe accurately or to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen or in what order the incidents had taken place he never could understand what defect of vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had duplicated itself at first
10886,8108-274318-0045.flac,noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of his hand down its back and then they advanced together toward the corner where the dog was smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend's muzzle purring while he rubbed
10887,8108-274318-0011.flac,seemed to turn aside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person the collie had made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner where he made noise enough in his savage rage to waken the dead before he fell to whining
10888,8108-274318-0035.flac,the perspiration poured down his face then by slow degrees the dark and dreadful countenance faded the glamour passed from his soul the normal proportions returned to walls and ceiling the forms melted back into the fog
10889,8108-274318-0044.flac,and pawed his knees and stared beseechingly up into his face he turned his head towards the corner where the collie still lay thumping his tail feebly and pathetically john silence understood he bent down and stroked the creature's living fur
10890,8108-274318-0037.flac,he made certain sigils gestures and movements at the same time for several minutes he continued to utter these words until at length the growing volume dominated the whole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it
10891,8108-274318-0036.flac,and the whirl of rushing shadow cats disappeared whence they came and with the return of the consciousness of his own identity john silence was restored to the full control of his own will power in a deep modulated voice
10892,8108-274318-0000.flac,it all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that the events that took place in this little modern room at the top of putney hill between midnight and sunrise that doctor silence was hardly able to follow and remember it all
10893,8108-274318-0026.flac,held his own against the dark discarnate woman whose motive was pure evil and whose soul was on the side of the dark powers it was the climax that touched the depth of power within him and began to restore him slowly to his own
10894,8108-274318-0041.flac,and the thumping touched the depths of affection in the man's heart and gave him some inkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered next from the shadows by the window a somewhat shrill purring announced the restoration of the cat to its normal state
10895,8108-274318-0023.flac,that shook him as the tempest shakes a leaf and close against his eyes clean level with his face he found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark countenance a countenance that was terrible even in its ruin
10896,8108-274318-0043.flac,clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief to which he had unwittingly lent himself owing to his subtle and electric constitution still uttering his sharp high purrings he marched up to his master and rubbed vigorously against his leg
10897,8108-274318-0034.flac,and therefore of power and as his self control returned to him he gradually accomplished this purpose even though trembling while he did so yet the struggle was severe and in spite of the freezing chill of the air
10898,8108-274318-0020.flac,the strong glamour thrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the veil but at the time he was not sufficiently aware of this and as with all true glamour was unable to grasp
10899,8108-274318-0005.flac,the snarling of the enraged and terrified collie sounded sometimes so far away the ceiling seemed to have raised itself so much higher than before and much of the furniture had changed in appearance and shifted marvellously it was all so confused and confusing
10900,8108-274318-0033.flac,thus he stood in the main stream of evil unwittingly attracted by pender deflecting its course upon himself and after passing through the purifying piltr of his own unselfishness these energies could only add to his store of experience of knowledge
10901,8108-274318-0042.flac,smoke was advancing across the carpet he seemed very pleased with himself and smiled with an expression of supreme innocence he was no shadow cat but real and full of his usual and perfect self possession he marched along picking his way delicately
10902,8108-274318-0032.flac,how vicariously to absorb these evil radiations into himself and changed them magically into his own good purposes and since his motive was pure and his soul fearless they could not work him harm
10903,8108-274318-0009.flac,he sprang upwards and forwards working furiously with teeth and paws and with a noise like wolves fighting but only to dash back the next minute against the wall behind him then after lying still for a bit he rose to a crouching position
10904,8108-274318-0013.flac,walls animals and fire in a mist of darkness and folding also about his own mind other forms moved silently across the field of vision forms that he recognized from previous experiments and welcomed not
10905,8108-274318-0039.flac,wherein the powers of spiritual evil work their fell purposes harmony was restored first of all to his own soul and thence to the room and all its occupants and after himself the first to recognize it was the old dog lying in his corner
10906,8108-274318-0012.flac,and directly afterwards the doctor's own distress became intolerably acute he had made a half movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was denser than mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene draping room
10907,8108-274318-0017.flac,the whining of the dog sounded far away and all about him the cats flew busily to and fro silently playing their tearing rushing game of evil weaving the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor
10908,8108-274318-0010.flac,as though to spring again snarling horribly and making short half circles with lowered head and smoke all the while mowed piteously by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon himself then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business
10909,8108-274318-0030.flac,by ceasing to resist and allowing the deadly stream to pour into him unopposed he used the very power supplied by his adversary and thus enormously increased his own for the spiritual alchemy he had learned he understood that force
10910,8108-274318-0022.flac,something from the region of utter cold was upon him and then quite suddenly through the confused mists about him there slowly rose up the personality that had been all the time directing the battle some force entered his being
10911,8108-274318-0029.flac,and power and confidence came with them he began to breathe deeply and regularly and at the same time to absorb into himself the forces opposed to him and to turn them to his own account
10912,8108-274318-0046.flac,and uttering little soft sounds of affection in his throat the doctor lit the candle and brought it over he saw the collie lying on its side against the wall it was utterly exhausted and foam still hung about its jaws its tail and eyes responded to the sound of its name
10913,8108-274318-0024.flac,and the mark of spiritual evil was branded everywhere upon its broken features eyes face and hair rose level with his own
10914,8108-274318-0048.flac,most of them curiously misdirected but doctor silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had happened and his heart was wrung he stroked the dear body feeling it over for bruises or broken bones but finding none
10915,8108-274318-0028.flac,the inner forces stirred and trembled in response to his call they did not at first come readily as was their habit for under the spell of glamour they had already been diabolically lulled into inactivity but come they eventually did
10916,8108-274318-0007.flac,upon the proceedings of smoke and the collie that he only observed them as it were subconsciously and the excitement the flickering candlelight the distress he felt for the collie
10917,8108-274318-0021.flac,behind him like wind booming and tearing its way down the windows rattled the candle flickered and went out the glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of death and a great rushing sound swept by overhead
10918,8108-274318-0027.flac,he was conscious of course of effort and yet it seemed no superhuman one for he had recognized the character of his opponent's power and he called upon the good within him to meet and overcome it
10919,8108-274318-0004.flac,with brilliant green eyes flashing fire in all directions it was like the reflections from a score of mirrors placed round the walls at different angles nor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seemed to have altered
10920,8108-274318-0003.flac,and then increased indefinitely so that there were at least a dozen of them darting silently about the floor leaping softly on to the chairs and tables passing like shadows from the open door to the end of the room all black as sin
10921,8108-274318-0047.flac,but it was evidently very weak and overcome smoke continued to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes sometimes even standing on its body and kneeding into the thick yellow hair flame replied from time to time by little licks of the tongue
10922,8108-274318-0040.flac,flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure that something between a growl and a grunt that dogs make upon being restored to their master's confidence doctor silence heard the thumping of the collie's tail against the floor and the grunt
10923,8108-274318-0014.flac,unholy thoughts began to crowd into his brain sinister suggestions of evil presented themselves seductively ice seemed to settle about his heart and his mind trembled he began to lose memory
10924,8108-274318-0018.flac,he strove hard to collect himself and remember the words of power he had made use of before in similar dread positions where his dangerous practice had sometimes led but he could recall nothing consecutively
10925,8108-274318-0001.flac,it came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror the light was so uncertain the movements of the black cat so difficult to follow on the dark carpet and the doctor himself so weary and taken by surprise that he found it almost impossible
10926,8108-274318-0038.flac,for just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil forces by raising them into higher channels so he knew from long study the occult use of sound and its direct effect upon the plastic region
10927,8108-274318-0016.flac,and it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats all dark as the night all silent all with lamping eyes of green fire the dimensions of the place altered and shifted he was in a much larger space
10928,8108-274318-0019.flac,a mist lay over his mind and memory he felt dazed and his forces scattered the deeps within were too troubled for healing power to come out of them it was glamour of course he realized afterwards
10929,8108-274318-0025.flac,he never could properly measure or determine these two a man and a woman looked straight into each other's visages and down into each other's hearts and john silence the soul with the good unselfish motive
10930,8108-274318-0008.flac,were the poorest possible allies to careful observation at first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short dangerous bark from time to time snapping viciously at the empty air a foot or so from the ground once indeed
10931,8108-274318-0031.flac,ultimately is everywhere one and the same it is the motive behind that makes it good or evil and his motive was entirely unselfish he knew provided he was not first robbed of self control
10932,8108-274318-0015.flac,memory of his identity of where he was of what he ought to do the very foundations of his strength were shaken
10933,8108-274318-0006.flac,into the dimensions of quite another chamber that came to him with its hosts of cats and its strange distances in a sort of vision but these changes came about a little later and at a time when his attention was so concentrated
10934,8108-280359-0008.flac,air earth or water there was no rest for him anywhere tired at last of seeking what he could nowhere find loki built himself a house near a narrow glittering river which lower down flashed from a high rock into the sea below
10935,8108-280359-0025.flac,be able to torment the inhabitants of manheim or asgard by his evil doings thor proposed to return to asgard to bring a chain with which to bind the prisoner but odin assured him that he had no need to take such a journey
10936,8108-280359-0007.flac,or alone with dead nature everything seemed to know him and to find a voice in which to say to him
10937,8108-280359-0013.flac,by making a fishing net he spied in the distance the whole company of the gods approaching his house the sight of them coming all together beautiful and noble and free pierced loki with a pang that was worse than death
10938,8108-280359-0006.flac,sometimes he hid himself as one among a troop of timid reindeer sometimes he lay in the nest of a wood pigeon sometimes he swam a bright spotted fish in the sea but wherever he was among living creatures
10939,8108-280359-0011.flac,and she would have hidden him from the just anger of the gods if she could but the two sons cared little about their father's dread and danger they spent all their time in quarrelling with each other and their loud angry voices sounding above the waterfall
10940,8108-280359-0004.flac,he climbed to the tops of misty hills and crouched in the dark of hollow caves but above the wood and through the water and down into the darkness a single ray of calm clear light seemed always to follow him
10941,8108-280359-0027.flac,by their evil passions have fought with and destroyed each other with their sinews we must make a chain to bind their father and from that he can never escape it was done as asa odin said
10942,8108-280359-0002.flac,and no measure for the deep waters neither is there any possibility of counting the various forms under which i shall disguise myself odin will never be able to find me
10943,8108-280359-0016.flac,famous for his keen sight spied out the remains of the fishing net in the fire then odin knew at once that there was a river near and that it was there where loki had hidden himself he ordered his sons to make a new net and to cast it into the water
10944,8108-280359-0000.flac,for the future he must bend all his cunning and vigilance to the task of hiding himself from the gaze of those whom he had so injured and escaping the just punishment he had brought upon himself
10945,8108-280359-0001.flac,the world is large and i am very clever said loki to himself as he turned his back upon asgard and wandered out into manheim
10946,8108-280359-0010.flac,ali and nari came to live with him siguna was a kind woman far too good and kind for loki she felt sorry for him now that she saw he was in great fear and that every living thing had turned against him
10947,8108-280359-0028.flac,a rope was made of the dead wolves sinews and as soon as it touched loki's body it turned into bands of iron
10948,8108-280359-0014.flac,he rose without daring to look again threw his net on a fire that burned on the floor and rushing to the side of the little river he turned himself into a salmon swam down to the deepest stillest pool at the bottom
10949,8108-280359-0005.flac,and he knew that it came from the eye of odin who was watching him from air thron then he tried to escape the watchful eye by disguising himself under various shapes sometimes he was an eagle on a lonely mountain crag
10950,8108-280359-0015.flac,and hid himself between two stones the gods entered the house and looked all round in vain for loki
10951,8108-280359-0017.flac,and drag out whatever living thing they could find there it was done as he desired thor held one end of the net and all the rest of the gods drew the other through the water when they pulled it up the first time however it was empty and they would have gone away disappointed
10952,8108-280359-0021.flac,and with the greatest speed he attempted it thor however was watching for him and as soon as loki leaped out of the water he stretched out his hand and caught him while he was yet turning in the air
10953,8108-280359-0023.flac,at odin's first searching look loki was obliged to drop his disguise and cowering and frightened to assume his proper shape before the assembled lords one by one they turned their faces from him for in looking at him
10954,8108-280359-0019.flac,but not so quickly but that the gods saw him knew him through his disguise and resolved that he should no longer escape they themselves divided into two bands thor waded down the river to the waterfall
10955,8108-280359-0012.flac,would speedily have betrayed the hiding place even if odin's piercing eye had not already found it out at last one day when he was sitting in the middle of his house looking alternately out of all the four doors and amusing himself as well as he could
10956,8108-280359-0024.flac,they seemed to see over again the death of bolder the beloved you were told that there were high rocks looking over the sea near loki's house one of these higher than the rest had midway for projecting stones and to these the gods resolved to bind loki
10957,8108-280359-0026.flac,loki he said has already forged for himself a chain stronger than any you can make while we have been occupied in catching him his two sons alei and nari transformed into wolves
10958,8108-280359-0018.flac,saw that something living had certainly touched them they then added a weight to the net and threw it with such force that it reached the bottom of the river and dragged up the stones in the pool loki now saw the danger he was in of being caught in the net and
10959,8108-280359-0009.flac,he took care that his house should have four doors in it that he might look out on every side and catch the first glimpse of the gods when they came as he knew they would come to take him away her his wife seguna and his two sons
10960,8108-280359-0003.flac,i have no cause to fear but though loki repeated this over and over again to himself he was afraid he wandered far into the thick woods and covered himself with the deep waters
10961,8108-280359-0022.flac,loki wriggled his slippery slimy length through thor's fingers but the thunderer grasped him tightly by the tail and holding him in this manner in his hand waded to the shore there father odin and the other gods met him and
10962,8108-280359-0020.flac,the other god stood in a group below loki swam backwards and forwards between them first he thought he would dart out into the sea and then that he would spring over the net back again into the river this last seemed the easiest way of escape
10963,8108-280354-0019.flac,then at last he knew that the gods below were pitiless and full of sorrow he returned to the upper earth for three years
10964,8108-280354-0020.flac,finding his only consolation in the music of his lyre for he shunned all men and women
10965,8108-280354-0006.flac,he resolved to make one last effort to win her back he would go down to the lower world and seek her among the dead and try whether any prayer or persuasion could move pluto to restore his beloved near tanaram
10966,8108-280354-0022.flac,oak poplar line beech laurel ash pine plane and maple and many another tree had gathered together here drawn from their distance forest homes by the sounds of orpheus's lyre
10967,8108-280354-0024.flac,for this was one of the feasts of bacchus and the women were celebrating his rites wandering over the mountains with dance and revel when they saw orpheus they set up a shout of derision see they cried
10968,8108-280354-0004.flac,was to be but short lived for as the new made bride wandered through the woods with the other nymphs a poisonous serpent stung her heel and no remedy availed to save her orpheus was thrown
10969,8108-280354-0029.flac,and threw it with his lyre into the river hebrus there it floated down stream and strange to tell the cords gave forth a lament and the lifeless tongue uttered words
10970,8108-280354-0005.flac,into the most passionate grief at his wife's death he could not believe that he had lost her for ever but prayed day and night without ceasing to the gods above to restore her to him when they would not listen
10971,8108-280354-0010.flac,great lords of the world below the earth to which all we mortals must one day come grant me to tell a simple tale
10972,8108-280354-0000.flac,jason had persuaded orpheus to accompany the argonauts when they went to fetch back the golden fleece for he knew that the perils of the way would be lightened by song to the sound of his lyre the argo had floated down to the sea
10973,8108-280354-0008.flac,the three headed dog that guards the threshold of pluto undaunted by the terrors of the place orpheus passed through this gate and down a dark and dismal road to the kingdom of the dead
10974,8108-280354-0023.flac,yes and the beasts and the birds of the field came too and orpheus sat in their midst and sang and played the tunes of sorrow suddenly a great noise was heard of laughter and shouting and merry making
10975,8108-280354-0012.flac,sat on his stone to listen never yet had such sweet strains been heard in the world of gloom then for the first time tears moistened the cheeks of the furies and even the king and queen of the dead were moved to pity
10976,8108-280354-0031.flac,and seppho tuned afresh the lyre of orpheus
10977,8108-280354-0014.flac,nor must you once turn round to look upon her
10978,8108-280354-0013.flac,and she came yet halting from her recent wound take her says pluto and lead her back to the light
10979,8108-280354-0026.flac,and fell harmlessly to the ground then the women raised a wild shout and made such a clamor with trumpets and cymbals that the soft tones of the harp were drowned by the noise now at last the shots took effect
10980,8108-280354-0015.flac,else the boom we grant you will be but vain a steep path led upward from the realm of darkness and the way was hard to find through the gloom in silence orpheus led on till the goal was close at hand
10981,8108-280354-0001.flac,and he played so sweetly when they passed the rocks of the sirens that the dreadful monsters sang their most alluring strains in vain
10982,8108-280354-0025.flac,the wretched singer who mocks at women and will have no bride but the dead come let us kill him and show that no man shall despise us unpunished with these words they began to throw wands and stones at him
10983,8108-280354-0028.flac,the trees shed their leaves with grief and the dryads and nyads tore their hair and put on the garb of sorrow only the pitiless revelers knew no remorse they seized the singer's head
10984,8108-280354-0017.flac,he turned to gaze on his beloved dimly he saw her but for the last time for a power she could not resist drew her back orpheus stretched out his arms and tried to seize her but he only clasped the empty air
10985,8108-280354-0007.flac,in lyconia was a cave among dark and gloomy rocks through which led one of the entrances to the lower world this was the road by which hercules descended when he went to carry off cerberus
10986,8108-280354-0002.flac,whom he loved dearly and who returned his love but at their marriage the omens were not favourable hymen the marriage god came to it with a gloomy countenance and the wedding torches smoked
10987,8108-280354-0018.flac,he sat on the further bank without food or drink
10988,8108-280354-0027.flac,and in their fury the women fell upon him dealing blow on blow orpheus fell lifeless to the ground but he was not to die unwept the little birds of the forest mourned for him even the stony rocks wept
10989,8108-280354-0011.flac,the lifeless ghosts came flocking and as they heard they wept tantalus forgot his hunger and thirst
10990,8108-280354-0030.flac,it cried till head and lyr were carried down to the sea and on to lesbos the isle of sweet song wherein after years
10991,8108-280354-0021.flac,one day he sat down to rest on a grassy hill in the sunshine and played and sang to beguile his sorrow as he played the coolness of shady branches seemed all about him and looking up he found himself in the midst of a wood
10992,8108-280354-0016.flac,and the welcoming light of the upper air began to penetrate the darkness then a sudden fear struck his heart
10993,8108-280354-0009.flac,here he came in safety through the crowd of ghosts and phantoms and stood at last before the throne of pluto and proserpina then he touched the chords of his lyre and chanted these words
10994,8108-280354-0003.flac,and would not give forth a cheerful flame
10995,5022-29405-0042.flac,to the soft profusion of his reddish brown hair to his finely shaped sensitive lips but for two marked peculiarities in him which would have shown me to be wrong that is to say the expression of power about his head
10996,5022-29405-0036.flac,his daughter interfered and stopped him at the critical moment when he was actually offering his arm to conduct me in state across the kitchen cristel had just put her pretty brown hand over his mouth and said oh father do pray be quiet
10997,5022-29405-0009.flac,for all that time for some part of the time i answered i was catching moths in fordwitch wood
10998,5022-29405-0014.flac,i have asked the two ladies my lord has an engagement to dine here to day without ceremony they are most anxious to meet you my dear gerard you look surprised
10999,5022-29405-0038.flac,started up frightened and took refuge under the table at the next moment the deaf lodger walked into the room it was he beyond all doubt who had frightened the dog forewarned by instinct of his appearance
11000,5022-29405-0039.flac,what i had read of his writing disposed me now that i saw the man by daylight to find something devilish in the expression of his face no strong as it was my prejudice failed to make any discoveries that presented him at a disadvantage
11001,5022-29405-0006.flac,i slept badly the events that had happened since my arrival in england had excited me i suppose now and then in the wakeful hours of the night i thought of cristel with some anxiety
11002,5022-29405-0018.flac,i must tell you that lady rachel is the eldest she is married to the honourable captain milbay of the navy now away in his ship a person of extraordinary strength of mind i don't mean the captain i mean lady rachel
11003,5022-29405-0025.flac,the sooner i returned it to the writer of the confession the sooner i told him plainly the conclusion at which i had arrived the more at ease my mind would be the sluggish river looked muddier than ever the new cottage looked uglier than ever
11004,5022-29405-0031.flac,i now saw in their full beauty the lustre of her brown eyes the warm rosiness of her dark complexion the delightful vivacity of expression which was the crowning charm of her face she paused confusedly in the doorway
11005,5022-29405-0033.flac,my answer would no doubt have assumed the form of a foolish compliment if her father had not spared her that infliction
11006,5022-29405-0001.flac,i feel at a loss how to reply not one impression but many impressions troubled and confused my mind certain passages in the confession inclined me to believe that the writer was mad but i altered my opinion at the next leaf
11007,5022-29405-0034.flac,he says all right and he does nothing there's first as i told you just now the truly dreadful state of the drains i tried to stop him by promising to speak to the bailiff myself on hearing this good news mister toller's gratitude became ungovernable
11008,5022-29405-0011.flac,of course the bold girl contrived to attract your notice i replied that i had met with the bold girl purely by accident on her side as well as on mine and then i started a new topic
11009,5022-29405-0029.flac,on this old side of the house there's first drains he proceeded to reckon up the repairs counting with his fleshless thumb on his skinny fingers when he was interrupted by a curious succession of sounds which began with whining and ended with scratching at the cottage door
11010,5022-29405-0023.flac,she smiled and kissed her hand and fluttered out of the room charming perfectly charming and yet i was ungrateful enough to wish myself back in germany again i lit my cigar but not on the terrace
11011,5022-29405-0021.flac,poor sir george she refused him last week you really must have heard of sir george a member of parliament conservative of course quite broken hearted about lady lena gone away to america to shoot bears
11012,5022-29405-0016.flac,either i had forgotten lord uppercliffe during my long absence abroad or i had never heard of him
11013,5022-29405-0019.flac,i admire her intellect but her political and social opinions i must always view with regret
11014,5022-29405-0026.flac,i knocked at the door on the ancient side of the building
11015,5022-29405-0000.flac,time has passed since i first read it and changes have occurred in the interval which leave me free to exercise my own discretion and to let the autobiography speak for itself if i am asked what impression of the writer those extraordinary pages produced on me
11016,5022-29405-0041.flac,that they had no right to be in a man's face
11017,5022-29405-0032.flac,and tried to resist me when i insisted on relieving her of the basket mister gerard she protested
11018,5022-29405-0020.flac,it's simply the most charming girl in england if you don't fall in love with her
11019,5022-29405-0043.flac,and the signs of masculine resolution presented by his mouth and chin on entering the room the first person and the only person who attracted his attention was cristel he bowed smiled possessed himself abruptly of her hand and kissed it
11020,5022-29405-0028.flac,my meals don't show on me you will excuse my receiving you in the kitchen sir it's the best room we have did cristy tell you how badly we are off here for repairs you bein our landlord we look to you to help us we have fallen to pieces as it were
11021,5022-29405-0012.flac,was it a pleasant dinner party last night i asked as if the subject really interested me i had not been quite four and twenty hours in england yet and i was becoming a humbug already
11022,5022-29405-0003.flac,at one time his tone in writing of this early life and his allusions to his mother won my sympathy and respect at another time the picture of himself in his later years and the defiant manner in which he presented it
11023,5022-29405-0027.flac,he stared at me in momentary perplexity and suddenly recovering himself asked me to walk in are you the young master sir ah yes yes i thought so my girl cristy said she saw the young master last night thank you kindly sir i'm pretty well
11024,5022-29405-0022.flac,you want to smoke after breakfast well i won't be in your way go out on the terrace your poor father always took his cigar on the terrace they say smoking leads to meditation i leave you to meditate on lady lena don't forget
11025,5022-29405-0010.flac,missus roylake's fascinating smile disappeared when i mentioned the mill she suddenly became a cold lady i might even say a stiff lady
11026,5022-29405-0013.flac,my stepmother was her charming self again the moment my question had passed my lips society provided it was not society at the mill was always attractive as a topic of conversation your absence was the only drawback she answered
11027,5022-29405-0037.flac,when we were all three disturbed by another interruption a second door communicating as i concluded from its position with the new cottage was suddenly opened in the instant before the person behind it appeared the dog looked that way
11028,5022-29405-0017.flac,we will drive out after luncheon and pay a round of visits when this prospect was placed before me i remembered having read in books of sensitive persons receiving impressions which made their blood run cold
11029,5022-29405-0007.flac,the poor girl as i was still inclined to fear might have serious reason to regret that he had ever entered her father's cottage at the breakfast table my stepmother and i met again missus roylake in an exquisite morning dress with her smile in perfect order
11030,5022-29405-0008.flac,informed me that she was dying with curiosity she had heard from the servants that i had not returned to the house until past ten o'clock on the previous night and she was absolutely bewildered by the discovery what could her dear gerard have been doing out in the dark by himself
11031,5022-29405-0040.flac,his personal attractions triumphed in the clear searching light i now perceived that his eyes were of that deeply dark blue which is commonly and falsely described as resembling the colour of the violet to my thinking they were so entirely beautiful
11032,5022-29405-0015.flac,i was obliged to acknowledge my ignorance missus roylake was shocked at any rate she resumed you have heard of their father lord uppercliffe i made another shameful confession
11033,5022-29405-0005.flac,at one positive conclusion as strangers he and i had first met as strangers i was determined we should remain having made up my mind so far the next thing to do with the clock on the mantelpiece striking midnight was to go to bed
11034,5022-29405-0004.flac,almost made me regret that he had not died of the illness which had struck him deaf
11035,5022-29405-0002.flac,and set him down as a man with a bitter humour
11036,5022-29405-0024.flac,leaving the house i took the way once more that led to fordwitch wood what would missus roylake have said if she had discovered that i was going back to the mill there was no other alternative the portfolio was a trust confided to me
11037,5022-29405-0035.flac,he was more eager than ever and more eloquent than ever in returning to the repairs and then sir there's the oven they do call bread the staff of life it's a burnt staff at one time and a clammy staff at another
11038,5022-29405-0030.flac,in a minute after the door was opened from without a brown dog of the companionable retriever breed ran in and fawned upon old toller cristel followed from the kitchen garden with a basket of vegetables on her arm
11039,5022-29411-0062.flac,you are deceived by a false friend who lies to you and ates you the man she was speaking of turned the corner of the new cottage
11040,5022-29411-0057.flac,and felt i don't doubt it i had intended to say no more than this but the remembrance of gloody's mysterious pervarication and of the uneasiness which i had undoubtedly felt when i thought of it afterwards led me i cannot pretend to say how
11041,5022-29411-0064.flac,i was left to decide for myself what should i have done if i had been twenty years older
11042,5022-29411-0068.flac,he pointed to the grandly darkening view the two men who could have painted the mystery of those growing shadows and fading lights lie in the graves of rambrandt and turner shall we go to tea on our way to his room we stopped at the miller's door
11043,5022-29411-0070.flac,to day she's in a room praying the warnings which i had neglected rose in judgment against me i was silent i was awed before i recovered myself cristel entered the kitchen her father whispered
11044,5022-29411-0069.flac,will you inquire he said if miss cristel is ready i went in old toller was in the kitchen smoking his pipe without appearing to enjoy it what's come to my girl he asked the moment he saw me
11045,5022-29411-0063.flac,it's too late now instead of letting me precede her as i had anticipated she ran on before me made a sign to the deaf man as she passed him not to stop her and disappeared through the open door of her father's side of the cottage
11046,5022-29411-0060.flac,cristel counted the strokes seven she said are you determined to keep your engagement she had repeated in an unsteady voice and with a sudden change in her color to paleness the strange question put to me by gloody
11047,5022-29411-0059.flac,i am not sure whether i have mentioned that the name of the place was caylem it was situated behind a promontory of the river bank clothed thickly with trees and was not visible from the mill in the present direction of the wind we could hear the striking of the church clock
11048,5022-29411-0058.flac,into associating cristel's agitation with something which this man might have said to her i was on the point of putting the question when she held up her hand and said hush the wind was blowing toward us from the riverside village to which i have already alluded
11049,5022-29411-0066.flac,his book of leaves would not have told him in my own handwriting that i believed in his better nature
11050,5022-29411-0056.flac,in that short time i told her that he had been found in my garden looking at the flowers as he had done no harm i said
11051,5022-29411-0061.flac,in his case i had failed to trace the motive i tri to discover it now tell me why i ought to break my engagement i said remember what i told you at the spring she answered
11052,5022-29411-0067.flac,explain it who can i knew that i was going to drink tea with him and yet i was unwilling to advance a few steps and meet him on the road i find a new bond of union between us he said as he joined me we both feel that
11053,5022-29411-0065.flac,the fear of appearing to be afraid and that i should have made my excuses to my host of the evening how would my moral courage have answered him if he had asked for an explanation useless to speculate on it had i possessed the wisdom of middle life
11054,5022-29411-0017.flac,he swears sir that he won't go at the end of his week's notice
11055,5022-29411-0043.flac,and the lurid reddening of the sun as it stooped in its setting lovely interfusions of sobered colour rested faded returned again on the upper leaves of the foliage as they lightly moved the mist rolling capriciously over the waters
11056,5022-29411-0044.flac,while it dimmed the turbid earthy yellow that discoloured and degraded the sdream under the full glare of day while my eyes followed the successive transformations of the view as the hour advanced tender and solemn influences breathed their balm over my mind
11057,5022-29411-0052.flac,the deaf gentleman submitted why did you invite yourself because a tea party is not complete without a woman her manner was as strangely altered as her looks that she was beside herself for the moment i clearly saw
11058,5022-29411-0029.flac,the hat i had seen on the head of that hateful woman was now sufficiently described for a man sly old toller leaving gloody unnoticed and keeping his eye on me saw the signs of conviction in my face and said with his customary audacity
11059,5022-29411-0053.flac,i know that she has visited you and spoken to you do you know what she has said i can guess
11060,5022-29411-0038.flac,i failed to see it myself in that light it struck me as i walked home that cristel might have made many a worse friend than the retired prize fighter a change in my manner was of course remarked by missus roylake's ready observation
11061,5022-29411-0003.flac,it is perhaps only right to add that my patience had been tried by the progress of domestic events which affected lady lena and myself viewed as victims calling with my stepmother at lord upperford's house later in the day
11062,5022-29411-0041.flac,on the river margin of the wood i was confronted by a wild gleam of beauty in the familiar view for which previous experience had not prepared me am i wrong in believing that all scenery no matter how magnificent or how homely it may be
11063,5022-29411-0026.flac,i've got burdens on my mind he explained or i should have thought of it too having done justice to his own abilities he bustled out in less than a minute he was back again in a state of breathless triumph gloody has seen the person he announced and
11064,5022-29411-0018.flac,and shoot the man and shoot himself a ha
11065,5022-29411-0035.flac,pray be kinder to me than ever pray let me be i said i would return on the next day and left the room with a sore heart old toller highly approved of my conduct he rubbed his fleshless hands and whispered
11066,5022-29411-0020.flac,about cristel after looking around the kitchen again i asked where she was sitting forlorn in a bedroom crying her father told me i went out for a walk by the river and i sat down and being sunday i fell asleep when i woke and got home again just now that
11067,5022-29411-0025.flac,in want of help i said we sometimes find it nearer than we had ventured to expect at our own doors the ancient miller rose at that hint like a fish at a fly gloody he cried find him at once mister toyler
11068,5022-29411-0011.flac,which way did i turn my steps men will wonder what possessed me women will think it a proceeding that did me credit i took the familiar road which led to the gloomy wood and the guilty river the longing in me to see cristel again was more than i could resist
11069,5022-29411-0006.flac,neither of these anticipations was realized once more my clever stepmother had puzzled me missus roylake talked as fluently as ever exhausting one commonplace subject after another
11070,5022-29411-0024.flac,but you mean to try yes i mean to try he answered me with little of the energy which generally distinguished him perhaps he was fatigued or perhaps he had something else to think of i offered a suggestion when we are
11071,5022-29411-0009.flac,i saw missus roylake reading a book in sad colored binding she was yawning over it fearfully when she discovered that i was looking at her equal to any emergency this remarkable woman instantly handed to me a second and similar volume
11072,5022-29411-0033.flac,of merciless conduct of some sort assuming this conclusion to be the right one i determined then and there that lady rachel should not pass the doors of trimley deen again if her bosom friend resented that wise act of severity by leaving the house i should submit with resignation
11073,5022-29411-0012.flac,not because i was in love with her only because i had left her in distress beyond the spring and within a short distance of the river i saw a lady advancing toward me on the path which led from the mill brisk smiling tripping along like a young girl
11074,5022-29411-0028.flac,miss cristel looked like a person surprised at seeing a stranger why i should call a free and easy stranger she walked in sir as if the place belonged to her i am not suspicious by nature as i hope and believe
11075,5022-29411-0023.flac,you will ask me who the person is
11076,5022-29411-0030.flac,who is she i followed at my humble distance the example of sir walter scott when inquisitive people asked him if he was the author of the waverley novels in plain english i denied all knowledge of the stranger wearing the green hat
11077,5022-29411-0047.flac,i thanked the little mill girl and gave her a kiss did i feel the child's breath in my day dream still fluttering on my cheek was i conscious of her touch i started trembled returned reluctantly to my present self
11078,5022-29411-0036.flac,you'll get it out of cristy to morrow and i'll help you i found gloody waiting for me outside the cottage he was anxious about miss cristel his only excuse he told me being the fear that she might be ill having set him at ease in that particular i said
11079,5022-29411-0049.flac,mister gerard you were lost in your thoughts i spoke and you never heard me i looked at her in silence was this the dear cristel so well known to me or was it a mockery of her that had taken her place
11080,5022-29411-0014.flac,patronizing piety on the way to afternoon church i must positively make a sketch of the cottage by the mill i mean of course the picturesque side of it that fine girl of tallers was standing at the door she is really handsomer than ever are you going to see her you wicked man
11081,5022-29411-0037.flac,you seem to be interested in miss cristel his answer raised him a step higher in my estimation how can i help it sir an odd man with a personal appearance that might excite a prejudice against him in some minds
11082,5022-29411-0048.flac,a visible hand touched my arm as i turned suddenly a living breath played on my face the child had faded into a vanishing shade the perfect woman who had grown from her had stolen on me unawares and was asking me to pardon her
11083,5022-29411-0019.flac,i'll be even with him you mark my words i'll be even with him that old toller the most exasperating of men judged by a quick temper had irritated my friend into speaking rashly was plain enough nevertheless i felt some anxiety
11084,5022-29411-0004.flac,or made an opportunity of talking together confidentially in a corner and once or twice i caught them looking at lady lena and at me even lord uppercliffe perhaps not yet taken into their confidence
11085,5022-29411-0016.flac,old toller was alone in his kitchen evidently annoyed and angry we are all at sixes and sevens mister gerard i've had another row with that deaf devil my new name for him and i think it's rather clever
11086,5022-29411-0034.flac,and should remember the circumstance with pleasure i am afraid you are ill cristel was all i could find to say under the double disadvantage of speaking through a door and having a father listening at my side oh no mister gerard not ill
11087,5022-29411-0032.flac,he led me to the door of his daughter's room and stood close by when i knocked softly and begged that she would come out the tone of the poor girl's voice answering forgive me sir i can't do it convicted the she socialist as i thought
11088,5022-29411-0027.flac,i beckoned to gloody waiting modestly at the door to come in and tell me what he had discovered i saw her outside sir wrapping at the door here with her parasol that was the servant's report her parasol
11089,5022-29411-0005.flac,noticed the proceedings of the two ladies and seemed to be at a loss to understand them when missus roylake and i were together again on our way home i was prepared to hear the praise of lady lena followed by a delicate examination into the state of my heart
11090,5022-29411-0031.flac,but i was naturally desirous of discovering next what lady rachel had said and i asked to speak with cristel her far seeing father might or might not have perceived a chance of listening to our conversation
11091,5022-29411-0045.flac,days happy days that were past revived again i walked hand in hand with my mother among the scenes that were round me and learnt from her to be grateful for the beauty of the earth with a heart that felt it
11092,5022-29411-0054.flac,her manner had become quieter her face was more composed her expression almost recovered its natural charm while she spoke of lady rachel i was stupefied try sir to forget it and forgive it she resumed gently
11093,5022-29411-0042.flac,derives a splendour not its own from favouring conditions of light and shade our gloomy trees and our repellent river presented an aspect superbly transfigured under the shadows of the towering clouds the fantastic wreaths of the mist
11094,5022-29411-0039.flac,i told her that i had been annoyed and offered no other explanation wonderful to relate she showed no curiosity and no surprise more wonderful still at every fair opportunity that offered she kept out of my way
11095,5022-29411-0022.flac,but mister toller i objected something must have happened to distress her has she not told you what it is not she obstinate about it leaves me to guess it's clear to my mind mister gerard that somebody has got at her in my absence
11096,5022-29411-0002.flac,if i had been a philosopher i should have recognized the symptoms of a very common attack of a very widely spread moral malady the meanest of all human infirmities is also the most universal and the name of it is self esteem
11097,5022-29411-0010.flac,i looked at the book i opened the book i recovered my presence of mind and handed it back if a female humbug was on one side of the window a male humbug was on the other
11098,5022-29411-0001.flac,still while cristel's entreaties in cristel's influence had failed to shake me gloody's strange language in gloody's incomprehensible conduct had troubled my mind i felt vaguely uneasy irritated by my own depression of spirits
11099,5022-29411-0013.flac,behold the mock republican known in our neighborhood as lady rachel she held out both hands to me but for her petticoats i should have thought i had met with a jolly young man
11100,5022-29411-0050.flac,you have surprised me i answered something must have happened since i saw you last what is it nothing i advanced a step and drew her closer to me a dark flush discoloured her face an overpowering brilliancy flashed from her eyes
11101,5022-29411-0021.flac,was how i found her i don't like to hear my girl crying she's as good as gold and better no sir our deaf devil is not to blame for this he has given cristy no reason to complain of him she says so herself and she never told a lie yet
11102,5022-29411-0007.flac,without the slightest allusion to my lord's daughter to my matrimonial prospects or to my visits at the mill i was secretly annoyed feeling that my stepmother's singular indifference to domestic interests of paramount importance
11103,5022-29411-0040.flac,my next day's engagement being for seven o'clock in the evening i put missus roylake's self control to a new test with prefatory excuses i informed her that i should not be able to dine at home as usual impossible as it was that she could have been prepared to hear this
11104,5022-29411-0055.flac,if i have misbehaved myself i don't rightly know what i am saying or doing i pointed to the new side of the cottage behind us is the cause there i asked no no indeed
11105,5022-29411-0000.flac,my loyalty towards the afflicted man whose friendly advances i had seen good reason to return was in no sense shaken his undeserved misfortunes his manly appeal to me at the spring
11106,5022-29411-0046.flac,we were tracing our way along our favorite woodland path and we found a companion of tender years hiding from us she showed herself blushing hesitating offering a nosegay of wild flowers my mother whispered to me
11107,5022-29411-0008.flac,returning to the house i tried to occupy myself with my collection of insects sadly neglected of late useless my own moths failed to interest me i went back to the garden passing the open window of one of the lower rooms which looked out on the terrace
11108,5022-29411-0051.flac,there was an hysterical defiance in her manner are you excited are you angry are you trying to startle me by acting apart i urged those questions on her one after another and i was loudly and confidently answered
11109,5022-29411-0015.flac,when we had left each other i thought of the absent captain in the navy who was lady rachel's husband he was a perfect stranger but i put myself in his place and felt that i too should have gone to see
11110,3374-298025-0006.flac,and now as a dignified mother with her demure babe in her arms i breathed the spring and i saw clearly all about me everlasting youth smiling i said to myself
11111,3374-298025-0012.flac,and yet with calm presence of mind i watched for the slightest sign of joy in you so that not one should escape me to impair the harmony i not only enjoyed but i felt and enjoyed
11112,3374-298025-0000.flac,an old man in agony but still genial and full of delicate wit drapes the motley spectacle of his lifelike writings with the costly tapestry of a preface which in itself is a beautiful and romantic painting
11113,3374-298025-0016.flac,so the calm broad silvery river winds along in great bends and sweeps until it and the lover's fantasy cradled upon it like the swan pass away into the distance and lose themselves in the immeasurable
11114,3374-298025-0021.flac,in accordance with natural laws the misunderstandings that attack the hidden centre of the loveliest existence and to confess to you the manifold effects of my awkwardness
11115,3374-298025-0025.flac,there is no better adaptation of means to ends than this namely that right at the start i begin by abolishing what we call orderly arrangement keep myself entirely aloof from it
11116,3374-298025-0030.flac,the selection is not difficult for since among the dreamy fancies which are here confined to you in permanent letters the recollection of this most beautiful world
11117,3374-298025-0032.flac,for once we know to a certainty that we live in a most beautiful world the next need is obvious
11118,3374-298025-0001.flac,but what shall my spirit bestow upon its offspring which like its parent is as poor in poesy as it is rich in love just one word a parting trope
11119,3374-298025-0007.flac,from this feeling or thought nothing could have turned me neither general despair nor personal fear for i believed
11120,3374-298025-0019.flac,all except that not long ago i was standing by the window and doing nothing and that i am now sitting here and doing something something which is perhaps little more than nothing perhaps even less
11121,3374-298025-0029.flac,it was written in a mood of impatient longing due to my not finding you where i most surely expected to find you in your room on your sofa in the haphazard words suggested by the pen you had lately been using
11122,3374-298025-0008.flac,but i gladly lost myself in all those blendings and intertwinings of joy and pain from which spring the spice of life and the flower of feeling spiritual pleasure as well as sensual bliss
11123,3374-298025-0004.flac,a fresh warm breath of life and love fanned me rustling and stirring in all the branches of the verdant grove i gazed and enjoyed it all the rich green the white blossoms and the golden fruit
11124,3374-298025-0005.flac,and in my mind's eye i saw too in many forms my one and only beloved now as a little girl now as a young lady in the full bloom and energy of love and womanhood
11125,3374-298025-0022.flac,i was about to describe the apprenticeship of my manhood
11126,3374-298025-0031.flac,is the most significant and has a certain sort of resemblance to what they call thought i choose in preference to anything else a dithrambic phantasy on the most lovely of situations
11127,3374-298025-0023.flac,a period which taken as a whole or in parts i can never look back upon without a great deal of inward amusement a little melancholy and considerable self satisfaction
11128,3374-298025-0028.flac,so i use my incontestable right to a confused style by inserting here in the wrong place one of the many incoherent sheets which i once filled with rubbish
11129,3374-298025-0002.flac,it is not alone the royal eagle who may despise the croaking of the raven the swan too is proud and takes no note of it
11130,3374-298025-0003.flac,human beings and what they want and do
11131,3374-298025-0009.flac,a subtle fire flowed through my veins
11132,3374-298025-0024.flac,still as a refined lover and writer i will endeavour to refashion the coarse occurrence and adapt it to my purpose for me and for this book however for my love of it and for its inner development
11133,3374-298025-0013.flac,the enjoyment you are so extraordinarily clever dear lucinda that you have doubtless long ere this begun to suspect that this is all nothing but a beautiful dream
11134,3374-298025-0018.flac,all the rest is readily explained by psychology
11135,3374-298025-0027.flac,and so inflexibly systematic if the form were also of that character this in its way unique letter would then acquire an intolerable unity and monotony
11136,3374-298025-0017.flac,my vision doubtless owes the grove and its southern colour effect to the huge mass of flowers here beside me
11137,3374-298025-0014.flac,not long ago i was standing by the window how long i do not know for along with the other rules of reason and morality i completely forgot about the lapse of time well i was standing by the window and looking out into the open
11138,3374-298025-0026.flac,frankly claiming and asserting the right to a charming confusion this is all the more necessary inasmuch as the material which our life and love offers to my spirit and to my pen is so incessantly progressive
11139,3374-298025-0010.flac,it was not only the wish to relieve the tormenting sting of my desire and to cool the sweet fire by gratification it was not for your lips that i longed or for your eyes or for your body
11140,3374-298025-0020.flac,i was just on the point of unfolding to you in clear and precise periods the exact and straightforward history of our frivolities and of my dulness i was going to expound to you step by step
11141,3374-298025-0011.flac,a marvelous mingling of memories and desires all the mysteries of caprice in man and woman seemed to hover about me when suddenly in my solitude
11142,3374-298025-0015.flac,the morning certainly deserves to be called beautiful the air is still and quite warm and the vadur here before me is fresh and even as the wide land undulates in hills and dales
11143,3374-298026-0043.flac,and sometimes falls headlong over its own honest zeal and speaks a word that is divine to the point of coarseness this apology would indeed save me
11144,3374-298026-0040.flac,i replied
11145,3374-298026-0026.flac,and for him there come too moments of the profoundest and fullest consciousness when all lives fall together and mingle and separate in a different way
11146,3374-298026-0045.flac,meantime i will by no means make common cause with them but will rather excuse and defend my liberty and audacity by means of the example of the little innocent wilhelmina
11147,3374-298026-0038.flac,yes even morality the charming morality of love
11148,3374-298026-0023.flac,and then again come moments of sudden and universal clarity when several such spirits of the inner world completely fused together into a wonderful wedlock and many a forgotten bit of our ego shines forth in a new light
11149,3374-298026-0014.flac,and we understand each other you accompany me through all the stages of manhood from the utmost wantonness to the most refined spirituality in you alone i first saw true pride
11150,3374-298026-0017.flac,like our love are immortal i can no longer say my love and your love they are both alike in their perfect mutuality marriage is the everlasting unity and alliance of our spirits
11151,3374-298026-0030.flac,and certainly any separation would only draw me more powerfully to you i bethink me how at our last embrace you vehemently resisting i burst into simultaneous tears and laughter
11152,3374-298026-0022.flac,seems to be complete in itself as single and indivisible as a person one thing crowds out another and that which just now was near and present soon sinks back into obscurity
11153,3374-298026-0012.flac,you recognize no separations your being is an indivisible unity that is why you are so serious and so joyous why you regard everything in such a large and indifferent way
11154,3374-298026-0000.flac,it looks at me joyously out of its deep eyes and opens its arms to embrace my spirit
11155,3374-298026-0046.flac,since she too is a lady whom i love most tenderly
11156,3374-298026-0039.flac,how can a man wish to write anything which it is scarcely permissible to talk about which ought only to be felt
11157,3374-298026-0007.flac,which might at last gratify my desire and give it rest and then again i suddenly and sadly bethink me of the gloomy time when i was always waiting without hope
11158,3374-298026-0029.flac,weave our love ever and ever more closely and firmly together just as a child like an echo doubles the happiness of its gentle parents nothing can part us
11159,3374-298026-0006.flac,the blood rushes wildly through my swollen veins my mouth thirsts for the contact of your lips and my fancy seeks vainly among the many forms of joy for one
11160,3374-298026-0008.flac,and madly loving without knowing it when my innermost being overflowed with a vague longing which it breathed forth but barely in half suppressed sighs
11161,3374-298026-0009.flac,oh i should have thought it all a fairy tale that there could be such joy such a love as i now feel and such a woman who could be my most tender beloved my best companion and at the same time
11162,3374-298026-0013.flac,that is why you love me all of me and will surrender no part of me to the state to posterity or to manly pleasures i am all yours we are closest to each other
11163,3374-298026-0042.flac,i wanted first to demonstrate to you that there exists in the original and essential nature of man a certain awkward enthusiasm which likes to utter boldly that which is delicate and holy
11164,3374-298026-0001.flac,the holiest and most evanescent of those delicate traits and utterances of the soul which to one who does not know the highest seem like bliss itself
11165,3374-298026-0011.flac,you know nothing the womanliness of your soul aside from minor peculiarities consist in its regarding life and love as the same thing for you all feeling is infinite and eternal
11166,3374-298026-0037.flac,and how you took it at the time and i think i know just as well what you will think of it and how you will take it here here in this little book in which you expect to find genuine history plain truth and calm reason
11167,3374-298026-0004.flac,each idea develops a countless crogeny
11168,3374-298026-0027.flac,the time is coming when we too shall behold in one spirit that we are blossoms of one plant or petals of one flower we shall then know with a smile
11169,3374-298026-0024.flac,and even illuminates the darkness of the future with its bright lustre as it is in a small way
11170,3374-298026-0016.flac,would seem to me nothing but a charming antithesis to the sublime frivolity of our marriage why should we not take the harshest whim of chance for an excellent jest and a most frolicsome caprice since we
11171,3374-298026-0021.flac,on the other side perhaps longing will be more completely realized i often wonder over it every thought and whatever else is fashioned within us
11172,3374-298026-0036.flac,into complete humanity that was my dythrambic fantasy on the loveliest situation in the loveliest of worlds i know right well what you thought of it
11173,3374-298026-0034.flac,we have to cool and mitigate the consuming fire with jests and thus for us the most witty of the forms and situations of joy is also the most beautiful
11174,3374-298026-0010.flac,a perfect friend for it was in friendship especially that i sought for what i wanted and for what i never hoped to find in any woman in you i found it all and more than i could wish for
11175,3374-298026-0035.flac,it is not merely the delight of exhaustion or the anticipation of revenge i see in it a wonderful and profoundly significant allegory of the development of man and woman
11176,3374-298026-0031.flac,i tried to calm myself and in a sort of bewilderment i would not believe that i was separated from you until the surrounding objects convinced me of it against my will
11177,3374-298026-0025.flac,i think in a large way that which we call life is for the complete inner mortal man only a single idea an indivisible feeling
11178,3374-298026-0015.flac,and true feminine humility the most extreme suffering if it is only surrounded without separating us
11179,3374-298026-0033.flac,the poignant grief would be transient and quickly resolve itself into complete harmony how could separation separate us when presence itself is to us as it were too present
11180,3374-298026-0002.flac,are merely the common atmosphere of our spiritual breath and life the words are weak and vague
11181,3374-298026-0018.flac,as that last glass of champagne we drink together when i said  and so let us drink out the rest of our lives
11182,3374-298026-0005.flac,i remember everything even the griefs and all my thoughts that have been and are to be
11183,3374-298026-0044.flac,but perhaps only at the enormous expense of my manhood itself for whatever you may think of my manhood in particular you have nevertheless a great deal against the sex in general
11184,3374-298026-0003.flac,furthermore in this throng of impressions i could only repeat anew the one inexhaustible feeling of our original harmony a great future beckons me on into the immeasurable
11185,3374-298026-0019.flac,and so i say again let us live and love i know you would not wish to survive me you would rather follow your dying husband into his coffin gladly and lovingly would you descend into the burning abyss
11186,3374-298026-0041.flac,a man feels it he must wish to talk about it and what a man wishes to talk about he may write
11187,3374-298026-0020.flac,even as the women of india do compelled by a mad law the cruel constraining purpose of which desecrates and destroys the most delicate sanctities of the will
11188,3374-298026-0032.flac,but then my longing grew again irresistible until on its wings i sank back into your arms suppose words or a human being to create a misunderstanding between us
11189,3374-298026-0028.flac,that what we now call merely hope was really memory do you know how the first seed of this idea germinated in my soul before you and took root in yours
11190,3374-298032-0020.flac,as when a person suddenly finds himself alone in the midst of immeasurable mountains of ice everything about me and in me was cold and strange and even my tears froze
11191,3374-298032-0013.flac,i held my head up and cried aloud
11192,3374-298032-0014.flac,why should you torment yourself in a few minutes you can be with her
11193,3374-298032-0024.flac,so did i regard my suffering with mysterious pleasure i regarded it as the symbol of life in general i believed that i was seeing and feeling the everlasting discord
11194,3374-298032-0042.flac,but why poetically conceive since we find the germ of everything in ourselves and yet remain forever only a fragment of ourselves
11195,3374-298032-0016.flac,unworthy man you cannot even endure the trifling dissonances of this ordinary life and yet you regard yourself as ready for and worthy of a higher life go away and do and suffer as your calling is
11196,3374-298032-0003.flac,since the last letter from your sister it is three days now i have undergone the sufferings of an entire life from the bright sunlight of glowing youth to the pale moonlight of sagacious old age
11197,3374-298032-0025.flac,in the lovely forms of refined culture seemed dead and trivial to me in comparison with this monstrous world of infinite strength and of unending struggle and warfare
11198,3374-298032-0023.flac,and as a delicate spirit often grows melancholy in the very lap of happiness over its own joy and at the very acme of its existence becomes conscious of the futility of it all
11199,3374-298032-0000.flac,the children are justified when they peep so curiously and timidly at a company of unknown faces each individual atom of everlasting time is capable of comprising a world of joy
11200,3374-298032-0022.flac,i hated everything earthly and was glad to see it all punished and destroyed i felt so alone and so strangely
11201,3374-298032-0006.flac,my state of mind was really very disconsolate now for the first time i understood what it really was being new born by the joyful news that you are well again
11202,3374-298032-0032.flac,because every earthly sentiment was entirely strange to me and the feeling never left me that i was consecrated to death
11203,3374-298032-0009.flac,now and then the pale face smiled and seemed asleep just as it had looked the last time i saw it then of a sudden the different memories all became confused
11204,3374-298032-0026.flac,even into the most hidden depths of existence on account of this remarkable feeling sickness acquired the character of a peculiar world complete in itself
11205,3374-298032-0039.flac,then you appear to me beckoned with the summons of death
11206,3374-298032-0041.flac,and only in that way does a human being become one and a complete entity that is by regarding and poetically conceiving himself as a centre of everything and the spirit of the world
11207,3374-298032-0028.flac,this feeling also clung to me and completely separated me from other men just as i was thundered from the earth by the thought of your nature and my love had been too sacred
11208,3374-298032-0036.flac,finally i became conscious that it was now nearly over the brow was no longer smooth and the locks were becoming gray my career was ended but not completed
11209,3374-298032-0035.flac,and the one eternal and indivisible humanity all existence was an uninterrupted divine service of solitary love
11210,3374-298032-0029.flac,it seemed to me that all was right so and that your unavoidable death was nothing more than a gentle awakening after a light sleep i too thought that i was awake when i saw your picture
11211,3374-298032-0027.flac,i felt that its mysterious life was richer and deeper than the vulgar health of the dreaming sleep walkers all around me and with the sickness which was not at all unpleasant
11212,3374-298032-0040.flac,an earnest longing for you and for freedom seized me i yearned for my dear old fatherland and was about to shake off the dust of travel when i was suddenly called back to life by the promise and reassurance of your recovery
11213,3374-298032-0004.flac,every little detail she wrote about your sickness taken with what i had already gleaned from the doctor and had observed myself confirmed my suspicion that it was far more dangerous than you thought
11214,3374-298032-0019.flac,and for that reason i suspect if i am not mistaken i have already imparted my suspicion to you that the next life will be larger and in the good as well as in the bad stronger wilder bolder and more tremendous
11215,3374-298032-0002.flac,i understand now the old fairy tale about the man whom the sorcerer allowed to live a great many years in a few moments for i know by my own experience the terrible omnipotence of the fantasy
11216,3374-298032-0012.flac,now a piercing pane from dark suns burned me with an insupportable glare now a beautiful radiance hovered about as if to entice me then i seemed to feel a fresh breath of morning air fann me
11217,3374-298032-0015.flac,i was already hastening to you when suddenly a new thought held me back and i said to my spirit
11218,3374-298032-0021.flac,wonderful worlds appeared and vanished before me in my uneasy dream i was sick and suffered great pain and i loved my sickness and welcomed the suffering
11219,3374-298032-0010.flac,with unbelievable rapidity the outlines changed reassumed their first form and transformed themselves again and again until the wild vision vanished
11220,3374-298032-0030.flac,which evermore transfigured itself into a cheerful diffused purity serious and yet charming quite you and yet no longer you the divine form irradiated by a wonderful light
11221,3374-298032-0011.flac,only your holy eyes remained in the empty space and hung there motionless even as the friendly stars shine eternally over our poverty
11222,3374-298032-0038.flac,stood ever unattainable before me i should have despaired had i not perceived and idolized both in you gracious madonna and you and your gentle godliness in myself
11223,3374-298032-0001.flac,and at the same time of opening up a fathomless abyss of pain and suffering
11224,3374-298032-0007.flac,i did not think of it as about to happen in the future or even in the present everything was already past for a long time you had been wrappt in the bosom of the cold earth
11225,3374-298032-0031.flac,now it was like the terrible gleam of visible omnipotence now like a soft ray of golden childhood
11226,3374-298032-0018.flac,is it not to you also remarkable how everything on this earth moves toward the centre how orderly everything is how insignificant and trivial so it has always seemed to me
11227,3374-298032-0005.flac,indeed no longer dangerous but decided past hope lost in this thought and my strength entirely exhausted on account of the impossibility of hurrying to your side
11228,3374-298032-0017.flac,and then present yourself again when your orders have been executed
11229,3374-298032-0033.flac,the years passed slowly by and deeds and works advanced laboriously to their goal one after the other a goal that seemed as little mine as the deeds and works seemed to be what they are called
11230,3374-298032-0008.flac,flowers had started to grow on the beloved grave and my tears had already begun to flow more gently mute and alone i stood and saw nothing but the features i had loved and the sweet glances of the expressive eyes
11231,3374-298032-0034.flac,to me they were merely holy symbols and everything brought me back to my one beloved
11232,3374-298032-0037.flac,the best strength of life was gone and still art and virtue
11233,1867-148436-0027.flac,and i won't ask much cash to boot i begin wonderin what pa was drivin at but i didn't say nothin jest held myself together an waited look over there to the corral says pa and pointed
11234,1867-148436-0023.flac,he was a sure enough tenderfoot leastwise he looked it an he talked it but he wasn't the familiarity of this description made steve set up a trifle straighter was he a ringer maybe i dunno
11235,1867-148436-0040.flac,thinkin up new ways of raising hell
11236,1867-148436-0006.flac,d' you think i'm on somebody's trail don't you know i've been through with that sort o game for a hell of a while when rocks turn into ham and eggs i'll trust you steve i'll tell you what i done to bard anyway yesterday
11237,1867-148436-0037.flac,ah twenty five dollars is enough says pa all right says the tenderfoot here's the money and he counts it out in paw's hand he says what a little beauty it would be a treat to see him work on a polo field pa says
11238,1867-148436-0008.flac,only it takes about three days to get to aldara maybe you think that interests me it don't logan overlooked this rejoinder saying is it his scalp you're after your ideas are like nest eggs logan
11239,1867-148436-0003.flac,i s'pose you're here askin after bard
11240,1867-148436-0025.flac,the boy paused to remember and then with twinkling eyes he mimicked that's very good of you sir but i'll only stop to make a trade with you this horse and some cash to boot for a durable mount out of your corral
11241,1867-148436-0000.flac,chapter twelve the first day mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog
11242,1867-148436-0019.flac,recognizing the true western breed even in this small edition nash grinned speakin man to man son i didn't think that but i thought i'd sort of feel my way which i'll say you're lucky you didn't try to feel your way with pa
11243,1867-148436-0011.flac,he sounds like a tenderfoot but he ain't a tenderfoot feeling that this parting shot gave him the honors of the meeting he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs overhearing stood still and gazed at his master
11244,1867-148436-0004.flac,bard who's he logan considered the other with a sardonic smile
11245,1867-148436-0005.flac,you'll wear out the snapper on it i'm on my way to the a circle why listen i'm all for old man drew you know that tell me what bard has on him never heard the name before did he rustle a couple of your sheep
11246,1867-148436-0007.flac,then he hinted around about learnin the way to eldara because he knows that town is pretty close to drew's place i guess i told him sure i did he should a gone due west but i sent him south there is a south trail
11247,1867-148436-0015.flac,feed him grain no you won't put him up i'll tend to that looks like a badun that's it
11248,1867-148436-0016.flac,unsaddled him and gave him a small feed the horse first rolled on the dirt floor and then started methodically on his fodder having made sure that his mount was not off his feed nash rolled a cigarette and strolled back to the house with the boy
11249,1867-148436-0035.flac,and tame down the bruises after jo laid em cold on the ground
11250,1867-148436-0012.flac,his eastern course nash pursued for a mile or more
11251,1867-148436-0024.flac,pa meets him at the door and asks him in
11252,1867-148436-0033.flac,and he always used to win out in fact he was known for it all around these parts he begun nice and easy
11253,1867-148436-0017.flac,where's the folks he asked maw's sick a little and didn't get up to day paw's down to the corral cussin mad but i can cook you up some chaw all right son i got a dollar here that'll buy you a pretty good store knife
11254,1867-148436-0044.flac,there wouldn't be no drawin card to get the boys round the house no more but you're lookin sort o sleepy stranger i am answered nash well if you'd seen that show you wouldn't be thinkin o sleep not for some time maybe not
11255,1867-148436-0010.flac,what you say cuts both ways steve this feller bard
11256,1867-148436-0028.flac,it's the best hoss i've ever had it was the best horse paw ever had to it was a piebald pinto called jo after my cousin josiah who's jest a plain badd'n and raises hell when there's any excuse the piebald
11257,1867-148436-0045.flac,but the point is i didn't see it d'you mind if i turn in on that bunk over there help yourself said the boy what time d'you want me to wake you up never mind i wake up automatic so long bud
11258,1867-148436-0018.flac,the boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw colored hair seemed positively white maybe you want to pay me he suggested fiercely maybe you think we're squatters at run a hotel
11259,1867-148436-0029.flac,he didn't even need an excuse you see
11260,1867-148436-0042.flac,and his lips twisted back the same smile he had when he got into the saddle but pretty soon i s'pose jo had a chance to figure out that it didn't do him no particular harm to be alone the minute he seen that he stopped fightin
11261,1867-148436-0014.flac,hello young feller lo stranger what's the chance of bunkin here for three or four hours and gettin a good feed for the hoss never better gim me the hoss
11262,1867-148436-0001.flac,and where the slopes pitched sharply down it wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot certainly the choice of nash was well made an eastern horse of blood over a level course
11263,1867-148436-0021.flac,i was jest thinkin of paw what's he sore about come out short at poker lately no he lost a hoss ha ha ha he explained
11264,1867-148436-0022.flac,nash sipped his coffee and waited on the mountain desert one does not draw out a narrator with questions
11265,1867-148436-0026.flac,the brute has gone lame you see
11266,1867-148436-0030.flac,when he leaves the corral he likes to have another hoss for a runnin mate and he was jest as tame as anything i could ride him anybody could ride him but if you take him outside the bars of the corral without company first thing he done
11267,1867-148436-0039.flac,but he didn't see none then the circus started an b'lieve me it was some circus jo hadn't had much action for some time
11268,1867-148436-0009.flac,and you set over em like a hen they look like eggs they feel like eggs but they don't never hatch that's the way with your ideas they look all right they sound all right but they don't mean nothin so long
11269,1867-148436-0013.flac,he was weary like his horse and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed he let the pony go on at the same tireless jog clinging like a bulldog to the trail about midday
11270,1867-148436-0036.flac,well this tenderfoot he looks over the hoss in the corral and says
11271,1867-148436-0031.flac,when he seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself
11272,1867-148436-0032.flac,which joe cin raise more hell for his size than any hoss i ever seen he's what you call an edicated bucker he don't fool around with no pauses he jest starts in an figers out a situation
11273,1867-148436-0038.flac,then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the grin off my face down goes the tenderfoot and takes his saddle and flops it on the piebald pinto and the piebald was jest as nice as milk then he leads him out of the corral and gets on
11274,1867-148436-0002.flac,but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail dawn came while they wound over the crest of the ridge and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade it was well into the morning before nash reached logan
11275,1867-148436-0041.flac,which maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performin because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle he was and he never pulled leather no sir he never touched the buckin strap but jest sat there with his teeth set
11276,1867-148436-0020.flac,and set about frying ham and making coffee this with crackers formed the meal he watched nash eat for a moment of solemn silence and then the foreman looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster let me in on the joke son nothin
11277,1867-148436-0043.flac,and started off at a gallop the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go which was over there damn my eyes says pa
11278,1867-148436-0034.flac,and the end was the rider lying on the ground whenever the boys round here wanted any excitement they used to come over and try their hands with jo
11279,1867-154071-0012.flac,there stood caroline smith in the door of the house she closed the door behind her and walking to the top of the steps paused there and looked up and down the street bill gregg groaned
11280,1867-154071-0011.flac,peering through the slit between the drawn curtains which sheltered him from being observed at his spying when he called out softly the sound brought gregg with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window there could be no shadow of a doubt about it
11281,1867-154071-0001.flac,found a big double room that ran across the whole length of the house from the back it looked down on the lights glimmering on the black east river and across to the flare of brooklyn to the left the whole ark of the fifty ninth street bridge was exposed
11282,1867-154071-0005.flac,ghost hours of the early morning they did not relax their vigil
11283,1867-154071-0034.flac,ain't that something done after you've done all that
11284,1867-154071-0017.flac,the same distinction between their clothes was in their faces the finely modelled prettiness of her features and the big careless chiselling of the features of bill gregg ronicky doone did not wonder that after her first fear her gesture was one of disdain and surprise
11285,1867-154071-0000.flac,chapter eight two apparitions
11286,1867-154071-0035.flac,not you bill you're going to buck up and go ahead full steam
11287,1867-154071-0014.flac,and so swift was that descent that when the girl idling down the steps across the street came on to the sidewalk bill gregg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her
11288,1867-154071-0037.flac,d'you know what she said well bill gregg she says i don't remember any such name that took the wind out of me i only had enough left to say
11289,1867-154071-0043.flac,you got to get that gent i seen grinning from the window grinning asked bill gregg grinding his teeth and starting from his chair was the skunk laughing at me sure every minute bill gregg groaned i'll smash every bone in his ugly head
11290,1867-154071-0028.flac,after that he did not move so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply his legs were twisted awkwardly sprawling across the floor in front of him one long arm dragged down toward the floor
11291,1867-154071-0018.flac,he went a long slow step closer to her with both his hands outstretched
11292,1867-154071-0036.flac,bill gregg smiled sourly
11293,1867-154071-0004.flac,go on back to sleep i'll call you again if anything happens
11294,1867-154071-0010.flac,one week was decided on as a fair test if at the end of that time caroline smith did not come out of the house across the street they could conclude that she did not stay there
11295,1867-154071-0002.flac,here they took up the vigil
11296,1867-154071-0008.flac,and he grew pale at the thought partner said ronicky doone if they are trying to keep her away from us they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days ain't that right
11297,1867-154071-0022.flac,the girl hesitated a moment
11298,1867-154071-0013.flac,snatched his hat and plunged through the door and ronicky heard the brief thunder of his feet down the first flight of stairs then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing
11299,1867-154071-0027.flac,now in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood he had lost her and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair
11300,1867-154071-0021.flac,the nose was hooked like the nose of a bird of prey the eyes were long and slanting like those of an oriental the face was thin almost fleshless so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a death's head
11301,1867-154071-0025.flac,what a contrast between the ascent and the descent he had literally flown down now his heels clumped out as slow and regular death march as he came back to the room when gregg opened the door
11302,1867-154071-0007.flac,by this time the nerves of the two watchers were shattered by the constant strain and the monotonous view from the front window was beginning to madden them it's proof that she ain't yonder said bill gregg
11303,1867-154071-0019.flac,ronicky doone followed that glance and he saw all hidden save a profile of the face
11304,1867-154071-0020.flac,what a face it was never in his life had ronicky doone seen a man who in one instant filled him with such fear and hatred such loathing and such dread such scorn and such terror
11305,1867-154071-0023.flac,for she made a slight outward gesture with one hand if this were in her mind however it vanished instantly she turned with a shudder and hurried away down the street
11306,1867-154071-0003.flac,bill gregg shook his head that's not the one she's all different a pile different ronicky ronicky sighed
11307,1867-154071-0026.flac,ronicky doone blinked and drew in a deep breath at the sight of the poor fellow's face gregg had known before that he truly loved this girl whom he had never seen
11308,1867-154071-0032.flac,said gregg huskily ain't there that's where you and me don't agree
11309,1867-154071-0042.flac,she looked like she'd run after you and try to explain but the fear of that fellow up in the window was too much for her and she didn't dare bill
11310,1867-154071-0009.flac,it's just about our last chance bill we've done our hunting pretty near as well as we could if we don't land her this trip i'm about ready to give up
11311,1867-154071-0031.flac,said ronicky doone bill look me in the eye and tell me man to man that you're a liar he added can you ever be happy without her man the cruelty of that speech made gregg flush
11312,1867-154071-0044.flac,shake said ronicky doone that's the sort of talk i wanted to hear
11313,1867-154071-0033.flac,look at the way things have gone you start out with the photograph of a girl now we've followed her found her name
11314,1867-154071-0039.flac,and then she looks back over her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house do you know why she looked back over her shoulder just for the reason i told you no bill there was a gent standing up there at the window watching her and how she acted
11315,1867-154071-0006.flac,apparently the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality not a sign of caroline smith appeared even during the second day
11316,1867-154071-0041.flac,that sent out the girl with the exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and speak to her when you seen her bill what that girl told you didn't come out of her own head it come out of the head of the gen across the way when you turned your back on her
11317,1867-154071-0030.flac,said bill gregg faintly now we hit the back trail and forget all about this he added with a faint attempt at cynicism i've just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine that's all
11318,1867-154071-0024.flac,as for bill gregg he bore himself straight as a soldier and came back across the pavement but it was the erectness of a soldier who had met with a crushing defeat and only preserves an outward resolution while all the spirit within is crushed
11319,1867-154071-0029.flac,as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor hardened hands his chin was fallen against his breast when ronicky doone crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder he did not look up it's ended
11320,1867-154071-0015.flac,for never had the miner seemed so clumsily big and gaunt never had his clothes seemed so unpressed and shapeless while his soft gray hat to which he still clung religiously appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast to the slim prettiness of the girl
11321,1867-154071-0038.flac,the gent that was writing those papers to the correspondence school to you from the west the one you sent your picture to and sent my picture to she says and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet you're mad she says
11322,1867-154071-0016.flac,she wore a black straw hat turned back from her face with a single big red flower at the side of it
11323,1867-154071-0040.flac,he's the one who's kept her in that house
11324,1867-154075-0019.flac,he knew every line in that sharp profile thank you
11325,1867-154075-0030.flac,relief wonder and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the eyes of john mark caroline you came for that suddenly he laughed heartily but there was a tremor of emotion in that laughter
11326,1867-154075-0002.flac,you followed his trail up the stairs to the kitchen and down the hall and up to harry's room we already knew he'd gone there but he left that room again and came down the hall yes
11327,1867-154075-0003.flac,and where did it lead right to this room ronicky stepped from among the smooth silks
11328,1867-154075-0017.flac,he was brought up with a shock by the sight of ronicky's big colt held at the hip and covering him with absolute certainty ruth tolliver did not cry out but every muscle in her face and body seemed to contract
11329,1867-154075-0022.flac,i dunno said ronicky doone smiling faintly at the coolness of the other what do you think about it meaning that i'm liable to put an end to your stay maybe tush tush
11330,1867-154075-0024.flac,ronicky doone smiled again you just oblige me partner he replied in his own soft voice just stay away from the walls of the room don't even sit down stand right where you are
11331,1867-154075-0037.flac,heavens man i can't persuade her to go with a stranger at night surely you see that i'll do the persuading said ronicky doone calmly and when you're on the streets with the girl
11332,1867-154075-0038.flac,do you suppose i'll rest idle and let you walk away with her once we're outside of the house mark said ronicky doone i don't ask no favors let your men come on
11333,1867-154075-0007.flac,the man growled some retort and left closing the door heavily behind him while ronicky doone breathed freely again for the first time now said the man of the sneer tell me the whole of it ruth ronicky set his teeth
11334,1867-154075-0004.flac,the time had almost come for one desperate attempt to escape and he was ready to shoot to kill a moment of pause had come a pause which in the imagination of ronicky
11335,1867-154075-0006.flac,you fool they simply grew dim when they got to this door i've been here for some time go back and tell them to hunt some more go up to the attic and search there that's the place an amateur would most likely hide
11336,1867-154075-0035.flac,this caroline smith may be a person of great value to me i have no doubt she is but i got a good argument
11337,1867-154075-0021.flac,though i wasn't playing my hand at eavesdropping i couldn't help hearing you partner the man of the sneer looked him over leisurely western he said at last decidedly western are you staying long in the east my friend
11338,1867-154075-0005.flac,that's a likely story i can show you the tracks
11339,1867-154075-0042.flac,at the same time a flush of excitement and fierceness passed over the face of john mark ronicky doone taken utterly by surprise was at a great disadvantage
11340,1867-154075-0045.flac,that brought a start from john mark and a flash of eagerness but he repressed the idea after a single glance at the girl we've shaken hands he admitted slowly as though just realizing the full extent of the meaning of that act
11341,1867-154075-0033.flac,leave this house and take a ride or a walk with me as much as that if you have to talk to her why not do the talking here i dunnow replied ronicky doone i figure she'd think too much about you all the time
11342,1867-154075-0013.flac,although you were glad to see him you warned him that it was dangerous to play with fire fire being me do i gather the drift of the story fairly well finally you have him worked up to the right pitch
11343,1867-154075-0027.flac,i see that you have a most determined cavalier i suppose he'll instantly abduct you and sweep you away from beneath my eyes she made a vague gesture of denial go ahead said the leader by the way
11344,1867-154075-0008.flac,had the clever devil guessed at the truth so easily had he sent his follower away merely to avoid having it known that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved go on the leader was repeating let me hear the whole truth
11345,1867-154075-0032.flac,and he brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and cool very well then it seems i've made an ass of myself but i'll try to make up for it now what about caroline
11346,1867-154075-0039.flac,i ain't terrible backward with the trigger finger john mark not that i figure on braggin but i want you to pick good men for my trail and tell em to step soft is that square
11347,1867-154075-0001.flac,that dropped him into the coal bin did he get coal dust on his shoes right and he didn't have sense enough to wipe it off an amateur a rank amateur i told you said the man of the sneer with satisfaction
11348,1867-154075-0043.flac,a great rage came into the eyes of john mark a great wonder came into the eyes of the westerner where did john mark get his sudden strength well said ronicky we've shaken hands and now you can do what you please
11349,1867-154075-0040.flac,suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain said ronicky you send for caroline smith i'm to do the persuading to get her out of the house we're safe to the doors of the house the minute we step into the street
11350,1867-154075-0012.flac,my dear girl john began ruth tolliver her voice shaking tush he broke in as smoothly as ever let me tell the story for you and spare you your blushes
11351,1867-154075-0000.flac,chapter twelve the strange bargain ronicky drew his gun and waited good said the man of the sneer go ahead it was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks
11352,1867-154075-0028.flac,my name is john mark i'm doone some call me ronicky doone i'm glad to know you ronicky doone i imagine that name fits you now tell me the story of why you came to this house of course it wasn't to see a girl
11353,1867-154075-0026.flac,i'd kill you like a snake stranger which i mostly think you are so step light and step quick when i talk certainly said the other bowing i am entirely at your service he turned a little to ruth
11354,1867-154075-0015.flac,yes said the girl unevenly that is ah murmured the man of the sneer you seem rather relieved that i have guessed he left the house in that case ronicky doone had held the latch of the door turned back for some time
11355,1867-154075-0036.flac,the gun partner and if you couldn't get the girl but see how absurd the whole thing is ronicky doone i send for the girl i request her to go down with you to the street and take a walk because you wish to talk to her
11356,1867-154075-0031.flac,the perfect torture which had been wringing the soul of the man with the sneer projected through the laughter i ask your pardon my dear said john mark to ruth i should have guessed you found him he confessed why he was here you took pity on him
11357,1867-154075-0010.flac,you smiled so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here the only way he could get in was by stealth is that right
11358,1867-154075-0009.flac,i i stammered the girl and she could say no more the man of the sneer laughed unpleasantly let me help you it was somebody you met somewhere
11359,1867-154075-0016.flac,now he pushed it open and stepped out he was only barely in time for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction since there was only one hiding place in the room
11360,1867-154075-0034.flac,yes i have a curious stock of useless information well you're right i'm going to try to get her back to bill but you can't expect me to assent to that i sure do and why
11361,1867-154075-0025.flac,you'd murder me if i took another step asked the man of the sneer and a contemptuous and sardonic expression flitted across his face for the first time i'd sure blow you full of lead said ronicky fervently
11362,1867-154075-0018.flac,as if she were preparing herself for the explosion you don't have to put up your hands said ronicky doone wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer he had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance
11363,1867-154075-0023.flac,i suppose ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot about what a terrible fellow i am but i don't use poison and i don't kill with mysterious ex rays i am as you see a very quiet and ordinary sort
11364,1867-154075-0044.flac,sit down leave the room anything
11365,1867-154075-0029.flac,you're wrong it was ah in spite of himself the face of john mark wrinkled with pain and suspicious rage i came to see a girl and her name i figure is caroline smith
11366,1867-154075-0014.flac,you show him that it is possible
11367,1867-154075-0011.flac,so he came in exactly that way like a robber but really only to keep a trist with his lady love a pretty story a true romance
11368,1867-154075-0020.flac,i congratulate you on your good taste a regular apollo my dear ruth he turned back to ronicky doone and i suppose you have overheard our entire conversation the whole lot of it said ronicky
11369,1867-154075-0041.flac,you're free to do anything you want to get either of us will you shake on that for a moment the leader hesitated then his fingers closed over the extended hand of ronicky doone and clamped down on them like so many steel wires contracting
11370,328-129766-0096.flac,other than embracing me as i say in his arms no not the whole night but rose up and dressed him in the morning and left me as innocent for him as i was the day i was born this was a surprising thing to me
11371,328-129766-0047.flac,which he was sorry for assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to dissatisfy his own curiosity but merely to assist me if there was any occasion but since i
11372,328-129766-0016.flac,but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly and that as i had no settled income so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death and this gave me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts
11373,328-129766-0003.flac,we had an indifferent good voyage till we came just upon the coast of england and where we arrived in two and thirty days but were then ruffled with two or three storms
11374,328-129766-0053.flac,oh widow says she i have bad news to tell you this morning what is that said i are the virginia ships taken by the french for that was my fear no no says she
11375,328-129766-0005.flac,where though it was remote from our port
11376,328-129766-0043.flac,and she again used to tell me she believed it was so from the beginning however she used to tell me that she thought i ought to expect some gratification from him for my company for indeed he did as it were engross me and i was seldom from him
11377,328-129766-0019.flac,where men find a mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a wife and consequently all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way i had spent the first season well enough
11378,328-129766-0034.flac,the winter before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house
11379,328-129766-0048.flac,in need of any assistance he had but one thing more to desire of me and that was that i would promise him that when i was any way straitened or like it to be so i would frankly tell him of it and that i would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer
11380,328-129766-0038.flac,and that i waited at bath till the next virginia fleet should arrive by which i expected considerable effects i understood by him and by others of him that he had a wife but that the lady was distempered in her head and was under the conduct
11381,328-129766-0036.flac,if i might believe him was to him
11382,328-129766-0051.flac,though i was secretly very glad of his offer some weeks passed after this and still i never asked him for money when my landlady a cunning creature who had often pressed me to it but found that i could not do it
11383,328-129766-0011.flac,that set me up formerly for a fortune she was dead and her husband also as i was informed upon sending a person unknown to inquire the looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to bristol and during my attendance upon that affair
11384,328-129766-0070.flac,and in a word pressed me to buy better
11385,328-129766-0062.flac,at the word sincere and asking him if i had ever given him any answers which were not sincere i promised him i would why then his request was he said to let him see my purse
11386,328-129766-0086.flac,and when he grew quite well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care and as he called it for hazarding my life to save his and now he made deep protestations of a sincere involable affection for me
11387,328-129766-0037.flac,and he had such an opinion of my virtue that as he often professed he believed if he should offer anything else i should reject him with contempt he soon understood from me that i was a widow that i had arrived at bristol from virginia by the last ships
11388,328-129766-0045.flac,and she did so and managed it so dexterously
11389,328-129766-0029.flac,and as i had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition and the great loss i had received
11390,328-129766-0027.flac,here i say i passed the winter as heavily as i had passed the autumn cheerfully
11391,328-129766-0006.flac,the isle of britain i resolved to venture it no more upon the waters which had been so terrible to me so getting my clothes and money on shore with my bills of loading and other papers i resolved to come for london
11392,328-129766-0059.flac,but i supposed she wanted what i owed her which was about eight guineas which i had resolved to give her and had accordingly
11393,328-129766-0013.flac,as had been my case before the bath is a place of gallantry enough expensive and full of snares i went thither indeed
11394,328-129766-0041.flac,as a man of honour and of virtue as well as of great estate and indeed i had a great deal of reason to say so of him too for though we lodged both on a floor and he had frequently come into my chamber even when i was in bed
11395,328-129766-0063.flac,i immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing to him pulled it out and there was in it three guineas and a half
11396,328-129766-0093.flac,he decently went out of the room till i was in bed and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room but lay there talking to me a great while at last repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me and not offer me the least injury
11397,328-129766-0042.flac,and i also into his when he was in bed yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss or so much as solicited me to anything till long after as you shall hear
11398,328-129766-0091.flac,and coming into that room said very frankly to him sir it is none of my business to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no
11399,328-129766-0098.flac,that though i was to him the most agreeable woman in the world yet because he loved me he could not injure me
11400,328-129766-0052.flac,makes a story of her own inventing and comes in
11401,328-129766-0054.flac,but the man you sent to bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he has brought none now i could by no means like her project
11402,328-129766-0097.flac,and perhaps may be so to others who know how the laws of nature work for he was a strong vigorous brisk person nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all but of mere affection insisting on it
11403,328-129766-0065.flac,where i had about six guineas more and some silver and threw it all down upon the bed and i told him there was all my wealth honestly to a shilling he looked a little at it but did not tell it
11404,328-129766-0083.flac,as it is apparent thai have done in other cases in this account but i affirm that through all this conversation abating the freedom of coming into the chamber when i or he was in bed and abating the necessary offices
11405,328-129766-0020.flac,for though i had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the bath for his diversion
11406,328-129766-0072.flac,and that he thought i had merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as i had done after this he made me take a maid and keep house
11407,328-129766-0095.flac,if he had not made those promises at all so after a little struggle as i said i lay still and let him come to bed when he was there he took me in his arms and so i lay all night with him but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me
11408,328-129766-0049.flac,adding that i should always find i had a true friend though perhaps i was afraid to trust him i admitted nothing that was fit to be said by one indefinitely obliged to let him know that i had a due sense of his kindness
11409,328-129766-0056.flac,said i for i assure you he brought me all the money i sent him for and here it is said i pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it and added i intend you shall have most of it by and by he seemed distasted a little at her talking
11410,328-129766-0078.flac,in a litter to the bath where there was more help and better advice to be had he consented and i brought him to the bath which was about fifteen miles as i remember here he continued very ill of a fever
11411,328-129766-0064.flac,not by a great deal well then he said he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the money i had every farthing i told him i would and i went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer
11412,328-129766-0021.flac,as it might be called i had resisted some casual offers of gallantry and had managed that way well enough i was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it and i had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which i wanted
11413,328-129766-0008.flac,the breaking of her main mast she had great damage on board and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled i had now a new scene of life upon my hands and a dreadful appearance it had i was come away with a kind of final farewell
11414,328-129766-0082.flac,however at last he grew better and gave hopes that he would recover as indeed he did though very slowly were it otherwise than what i am going to say i should not be backward to disclose it
11415,328-129766-0004.flac,got some refreshment on shore and put to sea again though we met with very bad weather again in which the ship sprung her main mast as they called it for i knew not what they meant but we got at last into milford haven in wales
11416,328-129766-0022.flac,i contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house i lodged who though she did not keep an ill house as we call it yet had none of the best principles in herself i had on all occasions behaved myself so well
11417,328-129766-0090.flac,to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it
11418,328-129766-0069.flac,and carry it all home into my own chamber i related this story the more particularly because of the good humour there was in it and to show the temper with which we conversed
11419,328-129766-0014.flac,but i must do myself justice as to protest i knew nothing amiss i meant nothing but in an honest way nor had i any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards i suffered them to be guided
11420,328-129766-0025.flac,there was no more in it i had many melancholy hours at the bath after the company was gone
11421,328-129766-0068.flac,when i had done so he made me put them into my lap and took my little drawer
11422,328-129766-0085.flac,and i would have removed my pallet bed but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him and then i removed to my own chamber
11423,328-129766-0032.flac,and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for lodging during the winter i paid nothing at all
11424,328-129766-0039.flac,of her own relations which he consented to to avoid any reflections that might as was not unusual in such cases be cast on him for mismanaging her cure and in the meantime he came to the bath to divert his thoughts
11425,328-129766-0050.flac,and indeed from that time i did not appear so much reserved to him as i had done before though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides but how freesoever our conversation was i could not arrive to that sort of freedom
11426,328-129766-0088.flac,as he would defend it if i was assaulted by a ravisher i believed him and told him i did so but this did not satisfy him he would he said
11427,328-129766-0057.flac,as she did at first as well as i taking it as i fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself again the next morning we talked of it again when i found he was fully satisfied
11428,328-129766-0092.flac,which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds well says my friend very readily these beds will do and as for the rest we are too near akin to lie together though we may lodge near one another
11429,328-129766-0002.flac,as you shall hear in its time i came away for england in the month of august after i had been eight years in that country and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me which perhaps few women have gone through the life of
11430,328-129766-0076.flac,called shepton where he had some business and was there taken very ill and so ill that he could not travel so he sent his men back to bath to beg me that i would hire a coach and come over to him before he went
11431,328-129766-0067.flac,but i knew not how much he took the drawer and taking my hand made me put it in and take a whole handful i was backward at that but he held my hand hard in his hand
11432,328-129766-0061.flac,for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment after some very kind expressions he asked me if i would be very honest to him and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me
11433,328-129766-0040.flac,from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was my landlady who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions gave me an advantageous character of him
11434,328-129766-0007.flac,the port whither she was bound was to bristol where my brother's chief correspondent lived i got to london in about three weeks where i heard a little while after that the ship was arrived in bristol
11435,328-129766-0000.flac,and so might marry again when he would
11436,328-129766-0028.flac,of what lay hardest upon my mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea i told her also that i had a mother and a brother in virginia in good circumstances
11437,328-129766-0060.flac,he was in might good humour when he heard me say i had paid her and it went off into some other discourse at that time but the next morning he having heard me up about my room before him he called to me and i answering he asked me to come into his chamber
11438,328-129766-0024.flac,for a wicked correspondence if they had any of them offered it yet there was one gentleman as above who always singled me out for the diversion of my company as he called it which as he was pleased to say was very agreeable to him but at that time
11439,328-129766-0026.flac,and for recruits of money yet i chose to come back to bath for my residence because being on good terms with the woman in whose house i lodged in the summer i found that during the winter i lived rather cheaper there
11440,328-129766-0058.flac,and smiling said he hoped i would not want money and not tell him of it and that i had promised him otherwise i told him i had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady's talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with
11441,328-129766-0073.flac,which i did very willingly believing as it appeared that i should lose nothing by it nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too we had lived thus near three months when
11442,328-129766-0017.flac,however i shook them off
11443,328-129766-0012.flac,i took the diversion of going to the bath for as i was still far from being old so my humour which was always gay continued so to an extreme and being now as it were a woman of fortune though i was a woman without a fortune
11444,328-129766-0066.flac,and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key and bade me open a little walnut tree box he had upon the table and bring him such a drawer which i did in which drawer there was a great deal of money an gold i believe near two hundred guineas
11445,328-129766-0033.flac,till it was found necessary to do otherwise she had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house and in particular the gentleman who as i said singled me out for his companion
11446,328-129766-0018.flac,but i was in the wrong place for it i was not now at reddrift where if i had set myself tolerably up some honest sea captain or other might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony but i was at the bath
11447,328-129766-0031.flac,and that my brother corresponded chiefly at bristol i thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to london where also i had not the least acquaintance my new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition
11448,328-129766-0084.flac,of attending him night and day when he was sick there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us oh that it had been so to the last after some time he gathered strength and grew well apace
11449,328-129766-0044.flac,i told her i had not given him the least occasion to think i wanted it
11450,328-129766-0046.flac,and so i put off all room for any offer for the present however it was not long before he attacked me again
11451,328-129766-0089.flac,it was great while after this that i had occasion on my own business to go to bristol upon which he hired me a coach and would go with me and did so and now indeed our intimacy increased
11452,328-129766-0030.flac,so i did not fail to let my new friend know that i expected a supply from thence and so indeed i did and as the ships went from bristol to york river in virginia and back again generally in less time from london
11453,328-129766-0009.flac,what i brought with me was indeed considerable had it come safe and by the help of it i might have married again tolerably well but as it was i was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole and this without any hope of recruit
11454,328-129766-0035.flac,letting him know that i was still with her but she denied it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same in a word this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation
11455,328-129766-0087.flac,but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own i told him i was fully satisfied of it he carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in bed with me
11456,328-129766-0055.flac,which indeed he did not want and i clearly saw that i should lose nothing by being backward to ask so i took her up short
11457,328-129766-0077.flac,he had left all his money and other things of value with me and what to do with them i did not know but i secured them as well as i could and locked up the lodgings and went to him where i found him very ill indeed however i persuaded him to be carried
11458,328-129766-0001.flac,and to assist and support me as long as i lived and that if he died before me he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still in the name of a sister and he was in some respects careful of me when he heard of me
11459,328-129766-0023.flac,as not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever and all the men that i had conversed with were of so good reputation that i had not given the least reflection by conversing with them
11460,328-129766-0075.flac,i was not very easy in that proposal not knowing what posture i was to live in there or how he might use me but while this was in debate
11461,328-129766-0071.flac,for i loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes i told him i must housewife the money he had lent me or else i should not be able to pay him again he then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me and knew my circumstances
11462,328-129766-0015.flac,as it is called there and contracted some unhappy acquaintances which rather prompted the follies i fell afterwards into than fortified me against them i lived pleasantly enough kept good company that is to say gay fine company
11463,328-129766-0074.flac,the company beginning to wear away at the bath he talked of going away
11464,328-129766-0080.flac,indeed if i had been his wife i could not have done more i sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer and then i got a pallet bed into his room and lay in it just at his bed's feet
11465,328-129766-0081.flac,i was indeed sensibly affected with his condition and with the apprehension of losing such a friend as he was and was like to be to me and i used to sit and cry by him many hours together
11466,328-129766-0094.flac,he starts out of his bed and now my dear says he you shall see how just i will be to you and that i can keep my word and away he comes to my bed i resisted a little but i must confess i should not have resisted him much
11467,328-129766-0079.flac,and kept his bed five weeks all which time i nursed him and tended him myself
11468,328-129766-0010.flac,i was entirely without friends nay even so much as without acquaintance
