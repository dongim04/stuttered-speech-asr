45,8468-295198-0030.flac,he came up into the garden and established himself under a burdock and began to practise italian scales the result was that poor old doctor bullfrog instead of being considered as a respectable old bor
46,8468-295198-0031.flac,got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners every bird and beast in the forest had a gibe at him and even old parson toowit thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call
47,8468-295198-0029.flac,we are the true musical race and so poor mister bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cat tails where his green spectacles an honest round back had excited even in the minds of the boys sentiments of respect and compassion
48,8468-295198-0028.flac,i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing suppose tommy oriole should sit half his days up to his hips in water as you do his voice would be as hoarse and rough as yours come up on the bank and learn to perch as we birds do
49,8468-295198-0005.flac,piped missus oriole timidly the orioles always have built in this manner and it suits our constitution a fiddle on your constitution how can you tell what agrees with your constitution unless you try you own you are not well

52,8468-295198-0017.flac,latterly some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age in fact since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits
53,8468-295198-0012.flac,the fact is quoth tommy i am a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace and my wife must learn to accommodate if she has a brilliant husband
54,8468-295198-0000.flac,and this was the case with mother magpie she was always full of everybody's business but her own up and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest knowing everyone's affairs telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do
55,8468-295198-0007.flac,but my husband prefers this style of building that's only because he isn't properly instructed pray did you ever attend doctor kite's lectures on the nervous system no i have no time to attend lectures who would sit on the eggs
56,8468-295198-0015.flac,and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses if a meddlesome magpie gets her claw into their nest but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter she bustled off down to water dock lane where as we said in a former narrative
57,8468-295198-0018.flac,which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts they pulled the young checkerberry before it even had time to blossom rooted up the sassafrash shrubs and gnawed their roots fired off guns at the birds and on several occasions
58,8468-295198-0013.flac,whose success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position she must pay something for it i am sure billy wren's wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home to say the truth
59,8468-295198-0022.flac,madam said doctor bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable i don't believe it i can't believe it you must have made a mistake
60,8468-295198-0008.flac,oh missus magpie pray don't speak to my husband he will think i've been complaining no no he won't let me alone i understand just how to say the thing i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave offence
61,8468-295198-0014.flac,my wife was all well enough content till old mother magpie interfered it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to
62,8468-295198-0023.flac,no no my good friend i never make mistakes what i know i know certainly
63,8468-295198-0002.flac,then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman who was always sleepy of a monday morning mother magpie would take a peep into missus oriole's nest sit chattering on a bough above and pour forth floods of advice
64,8468-295198-0006.flac,you are subject to headaches and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain ask old doctor kite i was talking with him about your case only yesterday and says he missus magpie i perfectly agree with you
65,8468-295198-0019.flac,when old doctor bullfrog was leading a concert had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones this was not the worst of it the little varlets had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts
66,8468-295198-0027.flac,dear madam consider my voice i never could hit the high notes how do you know it's all practice tommy oriole says so just try the scales as to your voice your manner of living has a great deal to do with it
67,8468-295198-0011.flac,but then he had a weakness for concerts and general society because he was held to be by all odds the handsomest bird in the woods and sung like an angel and so the truth was he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom titmouse or billy wren
68,8468-295198-0001.flac,and ready to cast her advice grotis at every bird and beast of the woods now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the oak tree to tell old parson to wit what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming
69,8468-295198-0021.flac,poor old doctor bullfrog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him one morning well neighbor how unreasonable people are who would have thought
70,8468-295198-0009.flac,i say my dear if you will persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie my dear i don't gossip she comes and bores me to death with talking and then goes off and mistakes what she has been saying for what i said
71,8468-295198-0003.flac,depend upon it my dear mother magpie would say that this way of building your nest swinging like an old empty stalking from a bough isn't it all the thing i never built one so in my life and i never have headaches
72,8468-295198-0010.flac,but you must cut her i try to all i can but she won't be cut it's enough to make a bird swear said tommy oriole tommy oriole to say the truth had as good a heart as ever beat under bird's feathers
73,8468-295198-0016.flac,lived the old music teacher doctor bullfrog the poor old doctor was a simple minded good amiable creatur who had played the double bass and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when
74,8468-295198-0004.flac,now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you it's all on account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner but my dear
75,8468-295198-0025.flac,bless me we shall all be ruined said missus bullfrog my poor husband oh as to that if you take things in time and listen to my advice said mother magpie we may yet pull you through you must alter your style a little
76,8468-295198-0024.flac,and nancy nibble who are married this very day i knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts and i can tell you you are going to be scandalously and ungratefully treated doctor bullfrog
77,8468-286673-0020.flac,and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond
78,8468-286673-0040.flac,and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle
79,8468-286673-0012.flac,who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him that makes him miss his share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody else's fault the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes
80,8468-286673-0030.flac,this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go
81,8468-286673-0036.flac,does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i'm so glad to get back i'll never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his
82,8468-286673-0006.flac,the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well the mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neckskin she was so eager to see them all
83,8468-286673-0008.flac,the mother turtle raised one of her fore feet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said
84,8468-286673-0025.flac,and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle
85,8468-286673-0035.flac,but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept
86,8468-286673-0039.flac,he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot
87,8468-286673-0024.flac,she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw two terrible great two legged animals wading into the pond from the shore boys she cried boys and she sprawled off the end of her log
88,8468-286673-0004.flac,and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to quite as though he were out of patience about something why didn't you turtles wait for me
89,8468-286673-0010.flac,yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side
90,8468-286673-0002.flac,and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters i'm coming in a minute the other little turtles waited but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail
91,8468-286673-0019.flac,and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher back shells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water
92,8468-286673-0028.flac,he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass
93,8468-286673-0003.flac,and talked awhile with him come on said the biggest little turtle don't let's wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed on to it and sat just close enough together
94,8468-286673-0023.flac,yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all
95,8468-286673-0022.flac,she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their webbed feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them
96,8468-286673-0009.flac,i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad
97,8468-286673-0021.flac,their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their rounded up back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black
98,8468-286673-0037.flac,if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that
99,8468-286673-0013.flac,and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell side walls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell
100,8468-286673-0032.flac,i wish i might help you some time
101,8468-286673-0015.flac,and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not have him with us long
102,8468-286673-0014.flac,i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sad very very sad
103,8468-286673-0026.flac,then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and rapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes
104,8468-286673-0027.flac,next the other great animal took him and turned him over and wrapped on his shells and stared at him
105,8468-286673-0016.flac,i remember so well my first slow child and how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her fore feet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water
106,8468-286673-0038.flac,he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there
107,8468-286673-0005.flac,you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch
108,8468-286673-0001.flac,the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank near by said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them
109,8468-286673-0029.flac,he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell
110,8468-286673-0011.flac,the first year i had only a few children the next year i had more and so it is gone every year a few more children than the year before until now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always one slow little turtle
111,8468-286673-0000.flac,the slow little mud turtle when the twenty little mud turtles broke their egg shells one hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops
112,8468-286673-0018.flac,or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises
113,8468-286673-0017.flac,the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them
114,8468-286673-0034.flac,and again he fell fast asleep
115,8468-286673-0033.flac,i'm here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you i'm not hungry he murmured
116,8468-286673-0031.flac,then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night
117,8468-286673-0007.flac,why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle who was trying to make a place for himself on the log they didn't wait for me he said i was coming right along but they wouldn't wait i think they are just as meat

179,6000-86686-0024.flac,and so the king had his goose as good as new to divert him as long as he lived and the saint supported him after he came into his property as i told you until the day of his death and that was soon after for the poor goose thought he was catching a trout one friday
180,6000-86686-0011.flac,says he as to repair your old goose for nothing what'll you gim me if i do the job for you that's the chat says saint kavin i'll give you whatever you ask says the king isn't that fair
181,6000-86686-0019.flac,i will says king o'toole and you're welcome to it says he though it's the last acre i have to give but you'll keep your word true says the saint as true as the sun says the king it's well for you king o'toole that you said that word says he
182,6000-86686-0002.flac,and thinking of drowning himself that could get no diversion in life when all of a sudden turning round the corner
183,6000-86686-0007.flac,is it a tinker you are says the king no says the saint i'm no tinker by trade king o'toole
184,6000-86686-0009.flac,with that the king whistled and down came the poor goose just like a hound waddling up to the poor cripple her master and as like him as two peas the minute the saint clapped his eyes on the goose i'll do the job for you says he king o'toole
185,6000-86686-0000.flac,well well but the darkness of mankind is untallerable well sir you must know as you didn't hear it afore that there was a king
186,6000-86686-0022.flac,that i've been discoursing all this time without knowing it says he
187,6000-86686-0001.flac,and it was he that owned the churches in the early days the king you see was the right sort he was the real boy and loved sport as he loved his life and hunting in particular and from the rising of the sun up he got and away he went over the mountains after the deer
188,6000-86686-0008.flac,says he what would you say says he if i made your old goose as good as new my dear at the word of making his goose as good as new you'd think the poor old king's eyes were ready to jump out of his head
189,6000-86686-0010.flac,by jaminy says king o'toole if you do i'll say thou're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes oh by dad says saint kavin
190,6000-86686-0003.flac,god save you kindly king o'toole says the young man true for you says the king i am king o'toole says he prince and plentypenitentiary of these parts says he but how came ye to know that says he oh never mind says saint kavin
191,6000-86686-0013.flac,this is the bargain i'll make with you king o'toole will you give me all the ground the goose flies over the first offer after i make her as good as new i will says the king you won't go back or your word says saint kavin
192,6000-86686-0014.flac,honor bright says king o'toole holding out his fist honor bright says saint kavin back again it's a bargain come here says he to the poor old goose
193,6000-86686-0017.flac,looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark and better than ever she was
194,6000-86686-0021.flac,then says the king who are you i'm saint kavin says the saint blessing himself o queen of heaven says the king making the sign of the cross between his eyes and falling down on his knees before the saint it is the great saint kavin says he
195,6000-86686-0016.flac,and throwing her up into the air whew says he just giving her a blast to help her and with that my jewels she took to her heels flying like one of the eagles themselves and cutting as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain
196,6000-86686-0012.flac,says the saint that's the way to do business now
197,6000-86686-0025.flac,but my jewel it was a mistake he made and instead of a trout it was a thieving horseheel and instead of the goose killing a trout for the king's supper by dad the eel killed the king's goose and small blame to him
198,6000-86686-0015.flac,and it's i that'll make you the sporting bird with that my dear he took up the goose by the two wings
199,6000-86686-0006.flac,and how is it you make your money so aisy
200,6000-86686-0005.flac,blurin agers how came ye to know about my goose says the king oh no matter i was given to understand it says saint kavin after some more talk the king says what are you i'm an honest man says saint kavin well honest man says the king
201,6000-86686-0023.flac,and so you're a saint says the king i am says saint kavin by jabers i thought i was only talking to a dacent boy says the king well you know the difference now says the saint i'm saint kavin says he the greatest of all the saints
202,6000-86686-0018.flac,says saint kavin for making her the like by jabers says the king i say nothing beats the art a man barring the bees and do you say no more nor that says saint kavin and that i'm beholdin to you says the king
203,6000-86686-0020.flac,when the king was as good as his word saint kavin was pleased with him and then it was that he made himself known to the king and says he king o'tool you're a decent man for i only came here to try you you don't know me says he because i'm disguised musha
204,6000-55211-0024.flac,and there's the tray did you notice he exulted turning back to the shelf you don't see that every day they get separated most generally you know these pieces have been in our family for generations said missus greggory with an accent of pride
205,6000-55211-0007.flac,and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought best to try to get over to the house maybe aunt hannah would come too for luncheon would she i'm afraid not returned billy with a rueful laugh she's got three shawls on this morning
206,6000-55211-0004.flac,though i wanted you to see the teapot too
207,6000-55211-0041.flac,william henshaw frowned angrily that was the man but his eyes the collector's eyes sought the teapot longingly before either the man or the collector could speak however missus greggory interposed quick words of remonstrance
208,6000-55211-0010.flac,nonsense uncle william of course you won't turn back
209,6000-55211-0053.flac,or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something during the brief minute that he hesitated however billy sprang forward missus greggory please won't you let me buy the teapot
210,6000-55211-0047.flac,alice greggory turned as if stung wished to sell she repeated the words with superb disdain she was plainly very angry her blue gray eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair
211,6000-55211-0003.flac,harlowe says others will have to know of it of course you see she's just made up her mind to sell it and asked him to find a customer i wouldn't trouble you but he says they're peculiar the daughter especially and may need some careful handling that's why i wanted you
212,6000-55211-0055.flac,but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy missus greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking dear child she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own
213,6000-55211-0012.flac,billy really i think we should turn back but billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes she was missus greggory yes she was even as she uttered the words
214,6000-55211-0009.flac,but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown i declare billy i'm not sure but we'd better turn back he fretted i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this billy shivered a little
215,6000-55211-0023.flac,with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot his eyes sparkled billy look what a beauty and it's a lowestoff too the real thing the genuine true soft paste
216,6000-55211-0019.flac,though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke the lowest aft yes i'm so glad that is of course i must be glad i'll get it her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair
217,6000-55211-0054.flac,and then won't you keep it for me here i haven't the hundred dollars with me but i'll send it right away you will let me do it won't you it was an impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness
218,6000-55211-0040.flac,as i started to tell you when i came in i have two new pupils and so turning to the man again i thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present
219,6000-55211-0042.flac,but alice my dear she almost sobbed you didn't wait to let me tell you
220,6000-55211-0048.flac,do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing alice
221,6000-55211-0052.flac,you are very kind mister henshaw but i do not think we care to sell the lowestoft to day both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh william henshaw picked up his hat his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do
222,6000-55211-0056.flac,even while she shook her head in denial not so her daughter alice greggory flushed scarlet she drew herself proudly erect thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us
223,6000-55211-0043.flac,he will give us a hundred dollars a hundred dollars echoed the girl faintly
224,6000-55211-0058.flac,come billy we'll bid you good morning ladies said william henshaw then decisively and billy with a little wistful pat on missus greggory's clasped hands went once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk
225,6000-55211-0039.flac,neilson supplied the man as she looked at billy and hesitated a swift red stained alice greggory's face with barely in acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother yes dear but that won't be necessary now
226,6000-55211-0027.flac,madam if you do not wish to sell he stopped abruptly his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china missus greggory gave a low cry but i do that is i must
227,6000-55211-0061.flac,still i was sorry for the poor little old lady i wish somehow she could have ad that hundred dollars it was the man who said this not the collector so do i rejoined billy dolefully
228,6000-55211-0032.flac,the collector's eyes glowed he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it then he turned to the tray after a moment he spoke i have only one other in my collection as rare he said
229,6000-55211-0038.flac,stammered missus greggory wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it my daughter alice mister henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and miss
230,6000-55211-0050.flac,perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darred and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes alice gasped missus greggory in dismayed horror
231,6000-55211-0008.flac,i'll tell her though and i'll see you at eleven finished billy as she hung up the receiver promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william at park street and together they set out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket
232,6000-55211-0005.flac,that she was one day to be mistress of the strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her i'd love to see it and i'll come gladly but i'm afraid i won't be much help uncle william she worried i'll take the risk of that
233,6000-55211-0037.flac,william henshaw too raised his chin he also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people my name is henshaw miss greggory i presume he said quietly i was sent here by mister harlow
234,6000-55211-0022.flac,near it set a tray like plate of the same ware and decoration if you'll lift it down please yourself motioned missus greggory i don't like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side
235,6000-55211-0036.flac,mother what is it who are these people she asked sharply billy lifted her chin the least bit she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice
236,6000-55211-0060.flac,the girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss i ever saw i didn't want her old lowestoft if she didn't want to sell it but to practically invite me there and then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger
237,6000-55211-0033.flac,i paid a hundred dollars for that i shall be glad to give you the same for this madam missus greggory started visibly a hundred dollars so much as that she cried almost joyously
238,6000-55211-0044.flac,billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass
239,6000-55211-0013.flac,however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion missus greggory was a cripple her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches
240,6000-55211-0030.flac,she finished with a wistful whimsicality billy turned away sharply there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot
241,6000-55211-0021.flac,what a beauty missus greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy in tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design
242,6000-55211-0035.flac,mother only think i've she stopped and drew back a little her startled eyes went from one face to another then dropped to the lowestoft teapot in the man's hands her expression changed at once she shut the door quickly and hurried forward
243,6000-55211-0026.flac,i have been told so yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association my mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir again her voice broke william henshaw cleared his throke but
244,6000-55211-0000.flac,chapter sixteen a girl and a bit of lowest oft immediately after breakfast the next morning billy was summoned to the telephone oh good morning uncle william she called in answer to the masculine voice that replied to her hullo
245,6000-55211-0059.flac,william henshaw drew a long breath well by jove billy the next time i take you curio hunting it won't be to this place he fumed wasn't it awful choked billy awful
246,6000-55211-0034.flac,brought of course if it's worth that to you she paused suddenly a quick step had sounded in the hall outside the next moment the door flew open
247,6000-55211-0001.flac,billy are you very busy this morning no indeed not if you want me well i do my dear uncle william's voice was troubled i want you to go with me if you can to see a missus greggory she's got a teapot i want
248,6000-55211-0028.flac,and that it will bring in money and we need money she threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks i can't do much at work that pays i sew she nodded toward the machine by the window
249,6000-55211-0025.flac,you'll find them quite perfect i think perfect i should say they were cried the man they are then valuable missus greggory's voice shook indeed they are but you must know that
250,6000-55211-0031.flac,or against uncle william for wanting the teapot or for not wanting it if he did not buy it and so you see i do very much wish to sell missus greggory said then perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously
251,6000-55211-0049.flac,i can't help it stormed the girl hotly i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it
252,6000-55211-0014.flac,both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay
253,6000-55211-0006.flac,why how funny well i'll come at eleven you say at park street yes and thank you my dear i tried to get kate to go too but she wouldn't by the way i'm going to bring you home to luncheon kate leaves this afternoon you know
254,6000-55211-0015.flac,mechanically she had taken the chair toward which missus greggory had motioned her she had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain
255,6000-55211-0051.flac,with a little outward fling of her two hands alice greggory stepped back her face had grown white again i beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet i should not have spoken so
256,6000-55211-0020.flac,there was only despairing sorrow on her face now the man rose at once
257,6000-55211-0029.flac,but with only one foot to make it go you see the other is
258,6000-55211-0017.flac,we er i came from harlowe missus greggory he gave me to understand t you had an a teapot that er with his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table william henshaw came to a helpless pause
259,6000-55211-0002.flac,it's a genuine lowestoft harlow says will you go of course i will what time eleven if you can at park street she's at the west end
260,6000-55211-0018.flac,a curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed missus greggory's face terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy relief in the end conquered
261,6000-55211-0011.flac,she finished just above her breath missus greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs up which william henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing
262,6000-55211-0016.flac,missus greggory had seated herself now and william henshaw had cleared his throat nervously
263,6000-55211-0046.flac,and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp i am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly i certainly should not have made it had i not had missus greggory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot
264,6000-55211-0057.flac,we prefere them infinitely to charity oh but please i didn't mean you didn't understand faltered billy for answer alice greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it open oh alice my dear pleaded missus greggory again feebly
265,6000-55211-0045.flac,billy was wondering which she herself desired more that uncle william should buy the lowestoft or that he should not she knew she wished missus greggory to have the hundred dollars there was no doubt on that point then uncle william spoke
266,831-130746-0042.flac,you are safe said mister hoopdriver sweeping off his cap with an air of bowing courtly where are we safe but where chichester harbour he waved his arm seaward as though it was a goal do you think they will follow us
267,831-130746-0057.flac,but that night he was in the mood to dare anything so you found your young lady at last said the ostler of the red hotel
268,831-130746-0033.flac,his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position the night was a warm white silence save for the subtle running of their chains
269,831-130746-0037.flac,white dust hot underfoot blinding to the eye is now a soft grey silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence
270,831-130746-0012.flac,another gentleman who another gentleman in brown sir went into the yard sir got out the two bicycles sir and went off sir about twenty minutes ago bechamel stood with his eyes round and his knuckle on his hips
271,831-130746-0013.flac,but as yet he seemed merely stunned brown clothes he said and fairish a little like yourself sir in the dark the ostler sir jim duke
272,831-130746-0055.flac,almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes it was as i have indicated the hour and season of the full moon
273,831-130746-0011.flac,he rose with a fine surprise gone he said with a half laugh gone sir on her bicycle on her bicycle why she went sir with another gentleman this time bechamel was really startled
274,831-130746-0006.flac,it wasn't that one at all miss said the ostler i'd swear well that's mister beauwont said the barmaid anyhow their conversation hung comatose in the air switched up by bechamel
275,831-130746-0025.flac,and midhurst and haselmir and gildford and ripley and putney and follow this dear fool of a hoopdriver of ours and his young lady in grey out upon the moonlit road how they rode
276,831-130746-0027.flac,hoopdriver had cut im down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born had bechamel arisen in the way with rapers for a duel hoopdriver had fought as one to whom agencourt was a reality and drapery a dream
277,831-130746-0058.flac,quite a misunderstanding said hoopdriver with splendid readiness my sister had gone to bognore but i brought her back here i've took a fancy to this place and the moonlights simply divine we've had supper thanks and we're tired said mister hoopdriver
278,831-130746-0017.flac,stephen was too surprised to say anything but bourbon sir go on said bechamel damn you stephen's sympathies changed at once yes sir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marvelling
279,831-130746-0014.flac,then with infinite fervour he said but let us put in blank cartridge he said i might have thought he flung himself into the armchair damn her said bechamel for all the world like a common man
280,831-130746-0050.flac,you would make me your brother miss beaumont yes we could stop there together she took a minute to answer i am going to light these lamps said hoopdriver he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe
281,831-130746-0018.flac,she had evidently gone off with him and that little business was over and he was here stranded and sold
282,831-130746-0045.flac,he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic it's an ugly name he said but you are right in trusting me i would i would do anything for you this
283,831-130746-0039.flac,nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mister hoopdriver's skull at the turnings of the road he made his decision with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard the right he would say or again
284,831-130746-0052.flac,who would be hoopdriver on a night like this but the christian name christian name my christian name well chris he snapped his lamp and stood up if you will hold my machine i will light yours he said
285,831-130746-0003.flac,then stephen the waiter who had shown hoopdriver up came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question which that turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour and in the midst of this discussion
286,831-130746-0043.flac,we have turned and turned again it seemed to hoopdriver that he heard her sob she stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath
287,831-130746-0035.flac,and now they faced northwards and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and cheek there is a magic quality in moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden
288,831-130746-0028.flac,it was rescue elopement glory and she by the side of him he had seen her face in shadow
289,831-130746-0002.flac,there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse that made ten minutes
290,831-130746-0046.flac,promise to help and protect me i was unhappy at home never mind why a stepmother idle unoccupied hindered cramped that is enough perhaps then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire
291,831-130746-0010.flac,if so he was in for an explanation but he had it ready she was a monomaniac leave me alone with her he would say i know how to calm her missus beaumont said stephen well has gone
292,831-130746-0054.flac,she said with a laugh to break the intensity he opened his mouth and shut it again and with a sudden wincing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine she looked down at him
293,831-130746-0022.flac,i bechamel when with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door stephen entered with the bourbon
294,831-130746-0036.flac,it has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy route
295,831-130746-0023.flac,the moonlight ride and so the twenty minutes law passed into an infinity
296,831-130746-0031.flac,they scarcely heeded whither they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewy night pale and intricate and high
297,831-130746-0001.flac,that gave the fugitives five minutes then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the bar maid what the matter was and the governor being out they spent some more precious time wondering whatever was to be done
298,831-130746-0000.flac,the ostler being a fool rushed violently down the road vociferating after them then he returned panting to the vicuna hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up stopped to give them the cream of the adventure
299,831-130746-0049.flac,what we had best be doing you are tired you know and we can't wander all night after the day we've had that was chichester we were near she asked if he meditated with a tremble in his voice
300,831-130746-0024.flac,the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vicuna hotel we leave al bognor as we have left all chinchester
301,831-130746-0032.flac,at a footfall at a roughness in the road she seemed to be too intent upon escape to give much thought to him
302,831-130746-0040.flac,the left as one who knew so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea
303,831-130746-0020.flac,knickerbockers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths
304,831-130746-0029.flac,he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears but what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon the road turned northward going round through the outskirts of bognor
305,831-130746-0015.flac,i'll chuck this infernal business they've gone eh yes sir
306,831-130746-0059.flac,i suppose you won't take anything jessie the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jesse like that but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit good night siss he said and pleasant dreams
307,831-130746-0034.flac,he looked sidewas at her as she sat beside him with her ankle gracefully ruling the treddles now the road turned westward and she was a dark grey outline against the shimmer of the moon
308,831-130746-0030.flac,then amidst vilas again some warm and lamplit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw broad wan meadows shrouded in a low lying mist
309,831-130746-0026.flac,how their hearts beat together and their breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursuit for all that flight mister hoopdriver was in the world of romance had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit
310,831-130746-0016.flac,making a memorable saying let em go who cares and i wish him luck and bring me some bourban as fast as you can there's a good chap
311,831-130746-0051.flac,grave and intent how could she ever have thought him common or absurd but you must tell me your name brother she said her carrington said mister hoopdriver after a momentary pause
312,831-130746-0041.flac,hullo said mister hoopdriver saudovoca they dismounted abruptly stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side
313,831-130746-0009.flac,as without knocking stephen entered bechamel's face suggested a different expectation beg pardon sir said stephen with a diplomatic cough well said bechamel wondering suddenly if jessie had kept some of her threats
314,831-130746-0007.flac,they listened together his feet stopped turned went out of the dining room down the passage to the bedroom stopped again poor chap said the barmaid she's a wicked woman sh said stephen
315,831-130746-0038.flac,she who has spiritualized the world alone save for two attendant steady shining stares and in silence under her benighing influence under the benediction of her light rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night
316,831-130746-0044.flac,are you tired he asked i will do what has to be done the two black figures in the broken light were silent for a pace do you know she said i am not afraid of you i am sure you are honest to me
317,831-130746-0060.flac,but this was living indeed he told himself
318,831-130746-0019.flac,and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all that the girl had escaped through her stepmother in which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed
319,831-130746-0008.flac,after a pause bechamel went back to the dining room they heard a chair creak under him interlude of conversational eyebrows i'm going up said stephen to break the melancholy news to him bechamel looked up from a weak old newspaper
320,831-130746-0004.flac,making a sudden and awe stricken silence appeared bechamel in the hall beyond the bar walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and passed out of sight you conceive the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium
321,831-130746-0021.flac,he banged the arms of the chair with his fists and swore again
322,831-130746-0048.flac,i am entirely at your service i will help you with all my power i have lost an illusion and found a knight errant she spoke of bechamel as the illusion mister hoopdriver felt flattered but he had no adequate answer
323,831-130746-0053.flac,the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely she had to speak
324,831-130746-0056.flac,and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converged thereupon that chichester was at last attained it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm
325,831-130746-0005.flac,incredulous eyes stared into one another's in the bar as his paces muffled by the stair carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead
326,831-130746-0047.flac,to be a human being not a thing in a hutch and he i know said hoopdriver and now here i am i will do anything said hoopdriver she thought you cannot imagine my stepmother no i could not describe her
327,831-130739-0016.flac,it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen even at the cost of some blushes and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story
328,831-130739-0030.flac,of the concussions attended on that person's hasty frequently causeless and invariably ill conceived descents one large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist
329,831-130739-0018.flac,let us assume something of the scientific spirit the hard almost professional tone of the conscientious realist let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest where the unemotional
330,831-130739-0061.flac,hoopdriver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it never oil the steering it's fatal
331,831-130739-0024.flac,fired by these discoveries an investigator might perhaps have pursumed his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders elbows and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story
332,831-130739-0019.flac,and so to our revelation on the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed ladies and gentlemen a contusion and an abrasion on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contrusion also
333,831-130739-0008.flac,hair of a kind of dirty fairness grayish eyes and a skimpy immature moustache under his peaked indeterminate nose his features were all small but none ill shaped a rosette of pints decorated the lapelle of his coat
334,831-130739-0029.flac,considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner upon the bicycle saddle and that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent
335,831-130739-0045.flac,the shopwalker brings up parallel to the counter any particular time when you want your holidays he asks hoopdriver pulls at his skimpy moustache no don't want them too late sir of course
336,831-130739-0057.flac,carry one or two lemons with you don't tear yourself to death the first day and sit up right never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity you mind those things and nothing very much can't happen to you hoopdriver you take my word
337,831-130739-0026.flac,even in literature one must know where to draw the line now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shopman
338,831-130739-0007.flac,now if you had noticed anything about him it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable he wore the black morning coat the black tie and the speckled gray nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft
339,831-130739-0042.flac,through the chambers of his brain seeking some knightly quest in honour of that fair lady the lest but one of the girl apprentices to the dressmaking upstairs
340,831-130739-0034.flac,rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from roehampton to putney hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel
341,831-130739-0043.flac,he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
342,831-130739-0009.flac,we could show you something better of course no trouble madame i assure you such were the simple counters of his intercourse so i say
343,831-130739-0003.flac,what he might have the pleasure of showing you under certain circumstances as for instance hats baby linen gloves silks lace or curtains
344,831-130739-0054.flac,i'm getting fairly safe upon it now he told miss howe at other times hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity
345,831-130739-0037.flac,to seek the wholesome delight of exertion and danger and pain and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man to which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end
346,831-130739-0059.flac,never let the machine buckle there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling don't scorch don't ride on the footpath keep your own side of the road and if you see a tram line go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county
347,831-130739-0052.flac,said hoopdriver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient moustache
348,831-130739-0028.flac,would have fancied nothing of the kind
349,831-130739-0001.flac,a perfectly fictitious co by the by of putney on the fourteenth of august eighteen ninety fye had turned to the right hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend
350,831-130739-0038.flac,but enough of these revelations the central figure of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be backed by the senior porter and sent to you
351,831-130739-0056.flac,was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark briggs had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt hoopdriver's inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him have the machine thoroughly well oiled said briggs
352,831-130739-0055.flac,when the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and a very big place and studying a road map of the south of england
353,831-130739-0015.flac,but real literature as distinguished from anecdote does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone literature is revelation modern literature is indecorous revelation
354,831-130739-0014.flac,one glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilities at work all about you
355,831-130739-0020.flac,on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise on his left chin there were two bruises one a leaden yellow graduating here and there into purple and another obviously of a more recent date of a blotchy red
356,831-130739-0017.flac,the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was let us face it bravely the remarkable condition of this young man's legs let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness
357,831-130739-0033.flac,until sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old fashioned affair with a fork instead of a diamond frame a cushioned tire well worn on the hind wheel
358,831-130739-0048.flac,all drapers have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you the decision comes at last
359,831-130739-0062.flac,a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying and clean the chain daily with black lead you mind just a few little things like that
360,831-130739-0012.flac,sin then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view
361,831-130739-0021.flac,tumid and threatening proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner an unnatural hardness and reddish would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf
362,831-130739-0046.flac,how about this day week hoopdriver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the corners of the gingham folds in his hands his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations can he learn it in a week that's the question
363,831-130739-0053.flac,you stow it said mister hoopdriver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt
364,831-130739-0058.flac,save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe and then break out with an entirely different set of tips avoid running over dogs hoopdriver whatever you do
365,831-130739-0022.flac,and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points
366,831-130739-0010.flac,he would have danced about behind the counter have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you have put on one side those you selected extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tinfoil sheet from a fixture
367,831-130739-0023.flac,the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee so far we may proceed with our details
368,831-130739-0031.flac,for upon every one of them waits the jest of the unexpected tredle you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and whack you are rubbing your shin so out of innocence we ripen
369,831-130739-0027.flac,one might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a thrushing machine say or one of those haymaking furies but sherlock holmes
370,831-130739-0050.flac,at supper that night holiday talk held undisputed sway mister pritchard spoke of scotland miss isaacs clamoured abot
371,831-130739-0040.flac,a ruddy red haired lad in a very short tailless black coat and a very high collar who was deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of creton
372,831-130739-0006.flac,under which happier circumstances you might if of an observing turn of mind and not too much of a housewife to be inhuman have given the central figure of this story less cursory attention
373,831-130739-0039.flac,and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins to straighten them punctiliously near him is an apprentice apprenticed to the same high calling of drapers assistant
374,831-130739-0044.flac,they're going fairly well sir
375,831-130739-0013.flac,have scribbled still more flourishing j m all over the document have asked you if there was nothing more have stood by you supposing that you were paying cash until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change
376,831-130739-0004.flac,and making a kind of circular sweep invited you to step this way and so led you behind his ken
377,831-130739-0035.flac,a gasping a grunting a shouting of steer man steer a wavering unsteady flight a spasmodic turning of the missile edifice of man and machine and a collapse then you descry dimly through the dusk

426,1963-142393-0011.flac,and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn but what harm could he do by going to snowfield dinah could not be displeased with him for it
427,1963-142393-0034.flac,that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky had a mylder more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day adam's doubts and fears melted under this influence
428,1963-142393-0030.flac,i've always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me
429,1963-142393-0004.flac,but towards the middle of october the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion the weeks were unusually long dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind
430,1963-142393-0031.flac,when you can't look to them nearest to you to help you with a bit better thought
431,1963-142393-0002.flac,she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while and i've no right to be impatient in interrupting her with my wishes she's told me what her mind is and she's not a woman to say one thing and mean another
432,1963-142393-0026.flac,so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away his love for dinah was better and more precious to him for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow
433,1963-142393-0016.flac,this morning brought with him new thoughts through the grey country thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past that is a base
434,1963-142393-0018.flac,adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank god for another's misery and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy in adam's behalf
435,1963-142393-0045.flac,she was much longer coming than he expected he waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer at last he saw the little black figure
436,1963-142393-0046.flac,coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill slowly adam thought but dinah was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step
437,1963-142393-0053.flac,what was in her mind she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice but this second time she looked round
438,1963-142393-0041.flac,the little gray desolate looking hamlet unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn
439,1963-142393-0009.flac,and he thought he must write himself he must ask dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful he sat up late one night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect
440,1963-142393-0017.flac,and selfish even a blasphemous spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that is blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves
441,1963-142393-0050.flac,and adam rose from the stone wall it happened that just as he walked forward dinah had paused and turned round to look back at the village
442,1963-142393-0036.flac,he did not expect dinah to be at home at this hour but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate
443,1963-142393-0033.flac,october sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions
444,1963-142393-0032.flac,when adam came in sight of the grey town on the hillside and looked searchingly toward the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill the scene looked less harsh in the soft
445,1963-142393-0021.flac,which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible
446,1963-142393-0008.flac,if she had not felt this she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him as adam's confidence waned his patience waned with it
447,1963-142393-0054.flac,what a look of yearning love it was that the mild gray eyes turned on the strong dark eyed man she did not start again at the sight of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her round
448,1963-142393-0007.flac,would have too strong a grasp upon her
449,1963-142393-0028.flac,for she's better than i am
450,1963-142393-0039.flac,so adam got on his horse again and rode to the town putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the two chatty landlord from whose friendly questions and reminiscence
451,1963-142393-0006.flac,but that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us adam was no longer so confident as he had been he began to fear that perhaps dinah's old life
452,1963-142393-0055.flac,and they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell adam was content and said nothing it was dinah who spoke first adam she said it is the divine will
453,1963-142393-0024.flac,something like this sense of enlarged being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past
454,1963-142393-0003.flac,i'll wait patiently that was adam's wise resolution and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got
455,1963-142393-0015.flac,the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time or rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters and adam
456,1963-142393-0027.flac,it's like as if it was a new strength to me he said to himself to love her and know as she loves me
457,1963-142393-0020.flac,by wrapping it up in other words other folks were not created for my sake that i should think all square when things turn out well for me but it is not innoble to feel that the fuller life
458,1963-142393-0044.flac,because it was away from all eyes no house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep near no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky
459,1963-142393-0022.flac,by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day the growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty
460,1963-142393-0025.flac,the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point toward which that hard journey from snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him tender and deep as his love for hetty had been
461,1963-142393-0040.flac,he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards sloman's end with all his haste it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off
462,1963-142393-0057.flac,to bear and do our heavenly father's will that i had lost before adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes then we'll never part any more dinah till death parts us and they kissed each other
463,1963-142393-0029.flac,as if you could walk more fearless when you've more trust in another
464,1963-142393-0037.flac,he had set his mind on following her and bringing her home she was gone to sloman's end a hamlet about three miles off over the hill the old woman told him
465,1963-142393-0051.flac,adam was glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him he came within three paces of her and then said dinah
466,1963-142393-0001.flac,i wish i'd aske her to write to me though he thought and yet
467,1963-142393-0052.flac,she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place dinah adam said again
468,1963-142393-0019.flac,i should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said evil's evil and sorrow's sorrow
469,1963-142393-0035.flac,as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him he seemed to see dinah's gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know
470,1963-142393-0005.flac,he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught that she offers him to care much about the taste of the second he treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties
471,1963-142393-0023.flac,we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or a philosopher to his less complete formula
472,1963-142393-0038.flac,to preach in a cottage there as her habit was
473,1963-142393-0042.flac,perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away adam thought i'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again
474,1963-142393-0047.flac,now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill but adam would not move yet he would not meet her too soon he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness and now he began to fear
475,1963-142393-0014.flac,he had often been to oakburne and back since that first journey to snowfield but beyond oakburne the greystone walls the broken country the meagre trees seemed to be telling him afresh
476,1963-142393-0013.flac,that he was already on his way to snowfield on horseback this time for his hours were precious now and he had borrowed jonathan burge's good nag for the journey what keen memories went along the road with him
477,1963-142393-0056.flac,my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you and this moment now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love i have a fullness of strength
478,1963-142393-0000.flac,adam understood dinah's haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it
479,1963-142393-0012.flac,she had not forbidden him to go she must surely expect that he would go before long by the second sunday in october
480,1963-142393-0010.flac,it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips for her presence reconciled him to her will you perceive how it was adam was hungering for the sight of dinah
481,1963-142393-0048.flac,lest he should startle her too much yet he thought she's not one to be over startled she's always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill
482,1963-142393-0049.flac,perhaps she had found complete repose without him and had ceased to feel any need of his love on the verge of a decision we all tremble hope pauses with fluttering wings but now at last she was very near
483,1963-147036-0023.flac,noted the cycling clipse and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood so you were the cyclis eh he said that's right said milburgh it is an exercise to which i am very partial what do you want asked tarling alert and watchful
484,1963-147036-0001.flac,you he said again and walked towards her he held out his hand and she gave him the wallet without a word sit down he said kindly he thought she was going to faint i hope i didn't hurt you i hadn't the slightest idea
485,1963-147036-0032.flac,tarling stepped back he saw the malicious little smile on milburgh's face and could have struck him down miss rider does not wish me to see what is in this case he said
486,1963-147036-0006.flac,i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet she said listlessly but i was not on the bicycle who was it he asked she shook her head may i have that please
487,1963-147036-0019.flac,iam afraid oh i am afraid he crushed her in his arms his cheek against hers his lips tingling with the caress of her hair but there's nothing to be afraid of nothing he said eagerly if you were as guilty as hell i would save you
488,1963-147036-0033.flac,here it was the girl's voice surprisingly clear and steady her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it towards the detective there is a reason she said in a low voice
489,1963-147036-0014.flac,her head was still bent and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible tell you what she asked what you know of this business he said don't you realize how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion
490,1963-147036-0020.flac,if you are shielding somebody i would shield them because i love you odette no no she cried and pushed him back both her little hands pressing against his chest don't ask me don't ask me ask me tarling swung round
491,1963-147036-0018.flac,odette odette he whispered don't you realize that i love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness won't you tell me everything please no no no she murmured with a little catch in her voice please don't ask me
492,1963-147036-0035.flac,good god he muttered and read on
493,1963-147036-0005.flac,she looked up at his words i on the bicycle she asked no it was not i not you she shook her head i was in the grounds
494,1963-147036-0021.flac,there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him milburgh he said between his teeth milburgh smiled the other mockingly i 'm sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene
495,1963-147036-0027.flac,but it was an uneasy smile i make no accusation he said
496,1963-147036-0004.flac,it struck him at that moment that it was not an offence for odette rider to go up to her mother's house on a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers if there was any crime at all
497,1963-147036-0024.flac,i want you to carry out your promise mister tarling said milburgh smoothly tarling stared at him my promise he said what promise to protect not only the evil doer
498,1963-147036-0026.flac,and that you have it in your power to get us safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow tarling took one step towards him and milburgh shrank back do you accuse miss rider of complicity in this murder he demanded milburgh smiled
499,1963-147036-0034.flac,milburgh had gone too far tarling saw his face lengthen and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes then without further hesitation he opened the paper and read the first line took away his breath the confession of odette wrider
500,1963-147036-0012.flac,oh that calm
501,1963-147036-0028.flac,he shrugged his shoulders you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which i was endeavoring to remove to a place of safety tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it i shall see the contents of this wallet to morrow he said
502,1963-147036-0010.flac,he had no more idea that he did love her than whiteside would have had yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips the effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him
503,1963-147036-0025.flac,tarling started do you mean to say he said hoarsely do you mean to accuse i accuse nobody said milburgh with a wide sweep of his hands i merely suggest that both miss rider and myself are in very serious trouble
504,1963-147036-0008.flac,laying his hand on her shoulder why don't you tell me tell you what she asked without looking up tell me all there is to be told he said i could help you i want to help you she looked up at him
505,1963-147036-0022.flac,but the occasion is a desperate one and i cannot afford to stand on ceremony mister tarling tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager one comprehensive glance the detective gave him
506,1963-147036-0029.flac,locks will present very little difficulty
507,1963-147036-0007.flac,she held out her hand and he hesitated after all he had no right or title to this curious purse he compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it odette he said gently and walked round to her
508,1963-147036-0031.flac,the catchess snapped open and he threw back the flap then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girl's quivering face and read the terror in her eyes no no she cried almost beside herself no for god's sake no
509,1963-147036-0003.flac,she drew a chair to the table and dropped her face upon her hands and he stood by embarrassed almost terrified by this unexpected development so you were the visitor on the bicycle he said at last i didn't suspect
510,1963-147036-0017.flac,she got up to her feet unsteadily and swayed toward him in a second he was by her side his arms about her she made no resistance but rather he felt a yielding toward him which she had missed before her pale face was upturned to his and he stooped and kissed her
511,1963-147036-0016.flac,and he dropped her hand and rose when she looked up she saw that his face was white and set he walked to the door and unlocked it i'm not going to ask you any more he said quietly you know best why you came to me to night

527,1926-147979-0022.flac,and his mammy said he wasn't all wrong she named him samson because he was blind but on the plantation he was known as yellow martha's simple child
528,1926-147979-0002.flac,through january and february i went to the river with the harlings on clear nights and we skated up to the big island and made bombfires on the frozen sand but by march the ice was rough and choppy
529,1926-147979-0023.flac,he was docile and obedient but when he was six years old he began to run away from home always taking the same direction he felt his way through the lilacs along the boxwood hedge
530,1926-147979-0036.flac,several teachers experimented with him they found he had absolute pitch and a remarkable memory as a very young child he could repeat after a fashion any composition that was played for him no matter how many wrong notes he struck he never lost the intention of the passage
531,1926-147979-0035.flac,leaped forward in the dark struck his head on the open window and fell screaming and bleeding to the floor he had what his mother called a fit the doctor came and gave him opium when samson was well again his young mistress led him back to the piano
532,1926-147979-0028.flac,he put one foot over the window sill and straddled it his mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mastiff if he ever found him meddling samson had got too near the mastiff's kennel once and had felt his terrible breath on his face
533,1926-147979-0013.flac,his yellow face was lifted in the light with a show of white teeth all grinning and his shrunken papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes good evening gentlemen no ladies here good evening gentlemen
534,1926-147979-0044.flac,seffect boys he said confidentally
535,1926-147979-0032.flac,he seemed to know that it must be done with the fingers and not with the fists or the feet he approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct and coupled himself to it as if he knew it was to piece him out and make a whole creature of him
536,1926-147979-0005.flac,for missus gardener had gone to omaha for a week johnnie had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent minded it was missus gardener who ran the business and looked after everything her husband stood at the desk and welcomed in coming travellers

538,1926-147979-0052.flac,the light of youth d'arnauld played until his manager came and shut the piano before he left us he showed us his gold watch which struck the hours and a topaz ring given him by some russian noble man who delighted in negro melodies
539,1926-147979-0034.flac,he was feeling out the pattern that lay all ready made on the big and little keys when he paused for a moment because the sound was wrong and he wanted another miss nellie spoke softly he whirled about in a spasm of terror
540,1926-147979-0042.flac,she protested she'd be awful mad if you was to come out here and dance with us missus gardener's in omaha girl
541,1926-147979-0029.flac,he thought about that but he pulled in his other foot through the dark he found his way to the thing to its mouth he touched it softly and it answered softly kindly he shivered and stood still
542,1926-147979-0033.flac,that lay under the bones of his pinched conical little skull definite as animal desires the door opened miss nellie and her music master stood behind it but blind sampson who was so sensitive to presences did not know they were there
543,1926-147979-0049.flac,antonia seemed frightened at first
544,1926-147979-0012.flac,who were to play there next week and that mary anderson was having a great success in a winter's tale in london the door from the office opened and johnnie gardener came in directing blindarnau he would never consent to be led

547,1926-147979-0011.flac,a drug man and willy o'reili who travelled for a jewelry house and sold musical instruments the talk was all about good and bad hotels actors and actresses and musical proteges i learned that missus gardener had gone to omaha to hear booth and barrett
548,1926-147979-0025.flac,and went towards the window she saw this hideous little piccaninny dressed in an old piece of sacking standing in the open space between the hollyhawk rowse his body rocking automatically his blind face lifted
549,1926-147979-0031.flac,it was cold and hard and like nothing else in his black universe he went back to its mouth began at one end of the keyboard and felt his way down into the mellow thunder as far as he could go
550,1926-147979-0001.flac,but in black hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pitched frozen down to the bare stalk
551,1926-147979-0018.flac,while the mulatto sat rocking himself his head thrown back his yellow face lifted it shrivelled eyelids never fluttering he was born in the far south on the d'arnau plantation where the spirit if not the fact of slavery persisted
552,1926-147979-0010.flac,he was a dapper little irishman very vain homely as a monkey with friends everywhere and a sweetheart in every port like a sailor i did not know all the men who were sitting about but i recognized a furniture salesman from kansas city
553,1926-147979-0017.flac,now gentlemen i expect you've all got grand voices seems like we might have some good old plantation songs to night the men gathered round him as he began to play my old kentucky home they sang one negro melody after another
554,1926-147979-0038.flac,and he were gloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers in the middle of a crashing waltz darnau suddenly began to play softly and turning to one of the men who stood behind him whispered
555,1926-147979-0027.flac,talk a little while and then leave the room he heard the door close after them he crept up the front windows and stuck his head in there was no one there he could always detect the presence of any one in a room
556,1926-147979-0004.flac,the wind from without made waves in the long carpet a coal stove glowed at either end of the room and the grand piano in the middle stood open there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night
557,1926-147979-0016.flac,when he was sitting or standing still he swayed back and forth incessantly like a rocking toy at the piano he swayed in time to the music and when he was not playing his body kept up this motion like an empty mill grinding on
558,1926-147979-0047.flac,over the piano and began to draw the dance music out of it while the perspiration shone on his short wool and on his uplifted face
559,1926-147979-0048.flac,whenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath he would boom out softly who's that goin back on me one o these city gentlemen i bet now you girls
560,1926-147979-0008.flac,guests felt that they were receiving not conferring a favor when they stayed at her house even the smartest travelling men were flattered when missus gardener stopped to chat with them for a moment
561,1926-147979-0020.flac,his mother a buxome young negro wench who was a laundress for the dernause concluded that her blind baby was not right in his head and she was ashamed of him she loved him devotedly but he was so ugly with his sunken eyes in his fidgets
562,1926-147979-0040.flac,springing down he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining room tiny and lina antonia and mary dusac were waltzing in the middle of the floor they separated and fled towards the kitchen giggling kirk patrick caught tiny by the elbows
563,1926-147979-0037.flac,as piano playing it was perhaps abominable but as music it was something real vitalized by a sense of rhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses that not only filled his dark mind but worried his body incessantly
564,1926-147979-0000.flac,winter lies too long in country towns hangs on until it is stale and shabby old and sullen on the farm the weather was the great fact and the men's affairs wen on underneath it as the steams creep under the ice
565,1926-147979-0014.flac,we going to have a little music some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening it was the soft amiable negro voice like those i remembered from early childhood with the note of docile subservience in it
566,1926-147979-0046.flac,and on his watch case doubtless on his heart too he was an affectionate little man and he thought his wife a wonderful woman he knew that without her he would hardly be more than a clerk in some other man's hotel at a word from kirpektrick
567,1926-147979-0024.flac,whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin she whipped him unmercifully and told him what dreadful things old mister darnot would do to him if he ever found him near the big house but the next time samson had a chance he ran away again
568,1926-147979-0041.flac,what's the matter with you girls dancing out here by yourselves when there's a room full of lonesome men on the other side of the partition introduce me to your friends tiny the girls still laughing were trying to escape tiny looked alarmed
569,1926-147979-0009.flac,two classes those who had seen missus gardner's diamonds and those who had not when i stole into the parlor anson kir patrick marshall field's man
570,1926-147979-0019.flac,when he was three weeks old he had an illness which left him totally blind
571,1926-147979-0026.flac,though it did not occur to her that he might have more of it than other children one day samson was standing thus while miss nellie was playing her lesson to her music master the windows were open
572,1926-143879-0006.flac,grave she found herself and positively more weighted as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world
573,1926-143879-0009.flac,with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted
574,1926-143879-0039.flac,and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain
575,1926-143879-0023.flac,but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabel's silence about mister osmond for instance
576,1926-143879-0038.flac,an occasional lapse from candor in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception
577,1926-143879-0040.flac,advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend
578,1926-143879-0036.flac,a consummation the more desirable
579,1926-143879-0035.flac,her character had revealed itself
580,1926-143879-0041.flac,but it stood for a high water mark in the ebb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking moore and liking less
581,1926-143879-0034.flac,isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites
582,1926-143879-0045.flac,during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone to lodge made it virtually ineffitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came
583,1926-143879-0015.flac,missus ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations
584,1926-143879-0042.flac,a stationary affection in other words was impossible it must move one way or the other however that might be the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been
585,1926-143879-0016.flac,missus ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently various
586,1926-143879-0033.flac,but she added that she herself had always been consumed with a desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt
587,1926-143879-0022.flac,than that she didn't wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice an she would have been to close that rare volume forever
588,1926-143879-0001.flac,our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late spring time shortly after her return to the plazo criscentini
589,1926-143879-0043.flac,i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo oras she stood among the broken columns at the acropolis or fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamas
590,1926-143879-0025.flac,it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews
591,1926-143879-0020.flac,the trophies lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this was exactly what she had expected of isabel to give it form and body
592,1926-143879-0013.flac,and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped
593,1926-143879-0007.flac,a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at gardencourt a couple of years before
594,1926-143879-0029.flac,she made her way down to rome without touching at florence
595,1926-143879-0004.flac,too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle
596,1926-143879-0000.flac,chapter thirty one isabel came back to florence but only after several months an interval sufficiently replete with incident it is not however during this interval that we are closely concerned with her
597,1926-143879-0017.flac,which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another
598,1926-143879-0011.flac,the little ludlows had not yet even from the american point of view
599,1926-143879-0005.flac,since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always reigned she wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do
600,1926-143879-0037.flac,she considered with a presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it
601,1926-143879-0014.flac,and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made
602,1926-143879-0002.flac,to social uses and there was that in her expression and attitude
603,1926-143879-0008.flac,if her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present
604,1926-143879-0028.flac,set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets the moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark
605,1926-143879-0027.flac,and euston square was a long way from piccadilly but isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily
606,1926-143879-0024.flac,was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to missus ludlow that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune
607,1926-143879-0021.flac,we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have affected in her native land
608,1926-143879-0012.flac,lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows
609,1926-143879-0030.flac,in the september previous had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer
610,1926-143879-0019.flac,isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lily's understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides
611,1926-143879-0046.flac,and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini madame merle on this occasion remaining in rome
612,1926-143879-0032.flac,had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame merle that they should take a little pilgrimage to the east madame merle remarked that her friend was restless
613,1926-143879-0003.flac,the tall window was open and though its green shutters were partially drawn the bright air of the garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with warmth
614,1926-143879-0031.flac,and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mister bantling that he would soon come over
615,1926-143879-0026.flac,the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in the street lamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red
616,1926-143879-0018.flac,on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities
617,1926-143879-0044.flac,deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival
618,1926-143879-0010.flac,she had left her husband behind her but had brought her children to whom isabel now played with equal munificence and tenderness the part of maiden aunt mister ludlow
619,1926-147987-0001.flac,she hesitated and then told us how strangely mister cutter had behaved before he went away
620,1926-147987-0023.flac,she and her husband had started home from omaha together the morning before they had to stop over several hours an waymore junction to catch the black hawk train
621,1926-147987-0002.flac,as he had just put a new yall lock on the front door cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone
622,1926-147987-0011.flac,where is she under the bed are you hussy i know your tricks wait till i get at you i'll fix this rat you've got in here he's caught all right so long as cutter had me by the throat there was no chance for me at all
623,1926-147987-0016.flac,she spent the whole morning bathing and pulticing me and rubbing me with arnica i heard antonia sobbing outside my door but i asked grandmother to send her away i felt that i never wanted to see her again
624,1926-147987-0025.flac,she saw him slip a twenty dollar bill into her hand bag with her ticket that bill she said should have aroused her suspicions at once but did not the trains are never called at little junction towns everybody knows when they come in
625,1926-147987-0015.flac,she seemed to understand though i was too faint and miserable to go into explanations when she took
626,1926-147987-0007.flac,the third night i spent at the cutters i awoke suddenly with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut everything was still however and i must have gone to sleep again immediately
627,1926-147987-0009.flac,i held my breath and lay absolutely still a hand closed softly on my shoulder and at the same moment i felt something hairy and cologne scented brushing my face
628,1926-147987-0027.flac,and that cutter must have planned it so the conductor told her the black hawk train was due at waymore twelve minutes after the kansas city train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to black hawk without her
629,1926-147987-0017.flac,she had let me in for all this disgustingness grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antonia but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude
630,1926-147987-0026.flac,mister cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off
631,1926-147987-0028.flac,she had no choice but to go on to kansa's city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omahal hotel
632,1926-147987-0031.flac,than from any experiences of his own his zest and debauchery might wane but never missus cutter's belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on
633,1926-147987-0014.flac,and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have a doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her
634,1926-147987-0012.flac,when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to do anything about it i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hatrack lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep
635,1926-147987-0005.flac,maybe jim would be willing to go over there and sleep and you could come here nights i'd feel safer knowing you were under my own roof i guess jim could take care of the silver and old usury notes as well as you could
636,1926-147987-0004.flac,grandmother was apprehensive at once i don't think it's right for you to stay there feeling that way i suppose it wouldn't be right for you to leave the place alone either
637,1926-147987-0024.flac,when he returned he told her that he would have to stay overnight there
638,1926-147987-0000.flac,the day after the cutters left antonia came over to see us grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted you've got something on your mind antonia she said anxiously
639,1926-147987-0019.flac,and had left again on the six o'clock train for dinver that morning the agent said his face was striped with cort plaster and he carried his left hand in a sling he looked so used up that the agent asked him what had happened to him since ten o'clock the night before
640,1926-147987-0013.flac,her cry of fright awakened me truly i was a battered object as she helped me to my room i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my lip was cut and stood out like a snout my nose looked like a big blue plum
641,1926-147987-0008.flac,i was only half awake but i decided that he might take the cutter' silver whoever he was
642,1926-147987-0010.flac,the man became insane he stood over me choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse so this is what she's up to when i'm away is it where is she you nasty welp
643,1926-147987-0006.flac,antonia turned to me eagerly oh would you jim
644,1926-147987-0018.flac,if the story once got abroad i would never hear the last of it i could well imagine what the old men done at the drug store would do with such a theme
645,1926-147987-0020.flac,my own garments have been treated so badly that i never saw them again grandmother burned them in the cutter's kitchen range while antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it the front door bell rang violently
646,1926-147987-0021.flac,there stood missus cutter locked out for she had no key to the new lock her head trembling with rage i advised her to control herself or she would have a stroke grandmother said afterwards
647,1926-147987-0029.flac,but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible mister cutter will pay for this missus burden he will pay missus cutter avowed nodding her horse like head and rolling her eyes
648,1926-147987-0030.flac,certainly cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil in some way he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her hysterical nature perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement
649,1926-147987-0003.flac,or the way he looked at her i feel as if he's up to some of his tricks again
650,1926-147987-0022.flac,antonia was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told missus cutter it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then missus cutter told her story
651,7780-274562-0057.flac,of human loveliness do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path byron who often erred erret not in saying i've seen more living beauty
652,7780-274562-0022.flac,and a decree finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison upon his twenty first birthday
653,7780-274562-0001.flac,giles fletcher no more remarkable man ever lived than my friend the young ellison he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune
654,7780-274562-0051.flac,its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth in his explanation of this phraseology mister ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma i mean the fact
655,7780-274562-0069.flac,it is easily understood said mister ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a general and more distantly observed effect
656,7780-274562-0040.flac,and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen in that
657,7780-274562-0031.flac,six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to imagine
658,7780-274562-0070.flac,he spoke upon this topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance which is little
659,7780-274562-0060.flac,for the feeling is no affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrators than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist he not only believes
660,7780-274562-0026.flac,it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigue or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility
661,7780-274562-0013.flac,and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox hunter his second principle was the love of woman
662,7780-274562-0019.flac,ellison this gentleman had amassed a princely fortune and having no very immediate connecions conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease
663,7780-274562-0092.flac,in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to exhort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime
664,7780-274562-0065.flac,each intulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collications alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation in that
665,7780-274562-0023.flac,from entering into possession as the heir of his ancestor seebright of a fortune of
666,7780-274562-0101.flac,then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the art is made to assume the eir of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god nor an emanation of god
667,7780-274562-0024.flac,there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic
668,7780-274562-0084.flac,that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles
669,7780-274562-0003.flac,the person of whom i speak seemed borne for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of tigo price priestly and condorsey of exemplifying by individual instance
670,7780-274562-0053.flac,while the component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short no position can be attained
671,7780-274562-0027.flac,or devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large specimens of virtue or playing the munificent patron of letters in art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity
672,7780-274562-0073.flac,to have well treated this theme there are properly he writes but two styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial
673,7780-274562-0085.flac,is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius the merit suggested is at best negative
674,7780-274562-0088.flac,rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance to the virtues which deny or refrain beyond these the critical art can but suggest
675,7780-274562-0004.flac,what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma that in man's physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle
676,7780-274562-0095.flac,yet which if attained would lend a charm to the landscape garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow
677,7780-274562-0056.flac,the criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictoral or sculptural combinations of points
678,7780-274562-0076.flac,in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony an order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify
679,7780-274562-0063.flac,in his instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his compers let a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form
680,7780-274562-0029.flac,and figures but sufficed to confound it was seen that even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars
681,7780-274562-0059.flac,it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art having i say felt its truth here
682,7780-274562-0028.flac,but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to figures
683,7780-274562-0002.flac,from his cradle to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere worldly or external sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness
684,7780-274562-0009.flac,experience mister ellison would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of pre eminent endowments
685,7780-274562-0082.flac,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities
686,7780-274562-0054.flac,from which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is this
687,7780-274562-0090.flac,such as that of keats or the sensitive plant of shelly but the thing done
688,7780-274562-0100.flac,definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity
689,7780-274562-0096.flac,so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in bringing about such result
690,7780-274562-0017.flac,his possessions had been always ample but upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur
691,7780-274562-0078.flac,which bear some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethian architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening
692,7780-274562-0097.flac,he secures all the advantages of interests or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art
693,7780-274562-0000.flac,the azure fields of heaven were sembled right in a large round set with flowers of light the flowers deluse in the roundsparks of dew that hung upon their azure leaves did show like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue
694,7780-274562-0061.flac,but positively knows that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form constitute and alone constitute the true beauty
695,7780-274562-0007.flac,it is not impossible that man the individual under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy with opinion such as these was my young friend fully imbued
696,7780-274562-0098.flac,in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling
697,7780-274562-0047.flac,here was indeed the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty
698,7780-274562-0066.flac,therefore her susceptibility of improvement
699,7780-274562-0055.flac,in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the color of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley
700,7780-274562-0102.flac,in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this
701,7780-274562-0099.flac,now if we imagine the sense of the almighty designe to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness
702,7780-274562-0032.flac,enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance i was not surprised however
703,7780-274562-0025.flac,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen
704,7780-274562-0034.flac,the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some peculiarities either in his early education
705,7780-274562-0083.flac,what is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion in color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much or little or nothing
706,7780-274562-0052.flac,which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce
707,7780-274562-0043.flac,under other circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become a painter the field of sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical
708,7780-274562-0075.flac,detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion an colour which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of the natural style of gardening
709,7780-274562-0077.flac,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english style
710,7780-274562-0071.flac,or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class of beings human once but now to humanity invisible
711,7780-274562-0008.flac,and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert it is indeed evident
712,7780-274562-0037.flac,was to be found in the creation of novel moos of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its everyday acceptation
713,7780-274562-0105.flac,that ellison thought to find and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity
714,7780-274562-0074.flac,one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land
715,7780-274562-0038.flac,or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his which i have already mentioned the idea that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth
716,7780-274562-0087.flac,appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes in flames in invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results
717,7780-274562-0044.flac,was too limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied at any time much of his attention and have now mentioned all the provinces in which
718,7780-274562-0067.flac,it was mister ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty
719,7780-274562-0045.flac,even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating i mean the most liberal public and recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment
720,7780-274562-0064.flac,let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity be admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective composition
721,7780-274562-0021.flac,many futile attempts had been made to set aside the singular bequest their expost facto character rendered them abortive
722,7780-274562-0012.flac,attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name he pointed to the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class are proverbially more happy than others
723,7780-274562-0016.flac,his intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labour than a necessity and an intuition his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women
724,7780-274562-0018.flac,and seldom fell radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it appears that about one hundred years prior to mister ellison's attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province
725,7780-274562-0093.flac,are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so
726,7780-274562-0039.flac,is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition
727,7780-274562-0042.flac,of which the human nature is absolutely capable mister ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse
728,7780-274562-0048.flac,the elements which should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in the multiform of the tree
729,7780-274562-0020.flac,minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the end of a hundred years
730,7780-274562-0011.flac,or rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air the health he said
731,7780-274562-0036.flac,and it was this bias perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment
732,7780-274562-0072.flac,for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful more especially than for our own had been set in order by god the great landscape garden of the whole earth in the course of our discussion
733,7780-274562-0035.flac,or in the nature of his intellect
734,7780-274562-0104.flac,in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to effect and lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife
735,7780-274562-0058.flac,ripe and real than all the nonsense of their stone ideal an landscape alone is the principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here
736,7780-274562-0103.flac,in the free exercise in the open air which resulted from personal direction of his plans in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford
737,7780-274562-0050.flac,he perceived that he should be employing the best means labouring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment of his destiny as poet
738,7780-274562-0062.flac,yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them
739,7780-274562-0049.flac,and in the multicolor of the flower he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness and in the direction or concentration of this effort or
740,7780-274562-0068.flac,that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens
741,7780-274562-0080.flac,calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest
742,7780-274562-0033.flac,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet he comprehended moreover the true character the august aims
743,7780-274562-0081.flac,from what i have already observed said mister ellison you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country
744,7780-274562-0089.flac,we may be instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a tempest an inferno a prometheus bound a nightingale
745,7780-274562-0079.flac,a mixture of pure art in the garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral a terrace
746,7780-274562-0091.flac,the sophists of the negative school who through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what
747,7780-274562-0086.flac,and appertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate adison into apotheosis in truth
748,7780-274562-0015.flac,i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men
749,7780-274562-0005.flac,the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of his career has taught me to understand that in general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind
750,2518-154825-0006.flac,but i will put a kerchief round and while i wrap it listen to how we lie and then choose what we shall do i nodded biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me and he went on
751,2518-154825-0001.flac,shakespeare the wild chalk was a bulwark between us and the foe and though one or two of them loosed off their matchlocks trying to get at us sideways they could not even see their quarry
752,2518-154825-0017.flac,it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall
753,2518-154825-0038.flac,putting my arms round his neck and so he bore me piccaback i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
754,2518-154825-0024.flac,we have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hour's start or more for they will take all that to search the under cliff and maskew too
755,2518-154825-0039.flac,both were on all fours now elzevir first and i following but as i crept along i relaxed care for a moment and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down and far below
756,2518-154825-0005.flac,ever so little it caused me sharp pain for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot they have broke the leg though it bleeds little elzevir said we have no time to splice it here
757,2518-154825-0027.flac,in a minute i knew from elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path even free and untrammelled
758,2518-154825-0004.flac,i cannot stand i said there is something gone in my leg and i feel blood running down into my boot he knelt and rolled down the leg of my stocking but though he only moved my foot
759,2518-154825-0008.flac,and he jerked his thumb at maskew
760,2518-154825-0056.flac,thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us
761,2518-154825-0041.flac,felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff
762,2518-154825-0022.flac,faugh said elzevir tis a poor beast has lost his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag
763,2518-154825-0007.flac,we have a quarter of an hour before the posse can get down to us but come they will and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty
764,2518-154825-0034.flac,but spent much time that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he
765,2518-154825-0055.flac,and i could open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands and knees and elzevir
766,2518-154825-0036.flac,but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
767,2518-154825-0010.flac,and they will take thee alive and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end
768,2518-154825-0046.flac,like setting guillemots against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
769,2518-154825-0015.flac,i never heard but one had climbed it and that was land or jordan when the excise was on his heels half a century back but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight
770,2518-154825-0033.flac,for there is no room to dance hornpipes here and hold thy eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither down nor seaward twas well he told me what to do and well i did it
771,2518-154825-0002.flac,and twas only shooting at a venture we were safe but for how short a time safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us
772,2518-154825-0051.flac,move thou must and his better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him
773,2518-154825-0030.flac,and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop
774,2518-154825-0035.flac,forgetting what i suffered cried out quicken thy pace lad if thou canst the time is short now so frail is man's temper that though he was doing more than any ever did to save another's life and was all i had to trust to in the world yet
775,2518-154825-0032.flac,the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff
776,2518-154825-0018.flac,tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hail us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg
777,2518-154825-0040.flac,i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
778,2518-154825-0047.flac,thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton
779,2518-154825-0050.flac,there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are lost pluck up thy courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot
780,2518-154825-0053.flac,so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskew's body
781,2518-154825-0029.flac,thus he went on for a time that seemed without end and yet was really but a minute or two and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive it all on the under cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliff side
782,2518-154825-0042.flac,and how he did it in such a narrow strate i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight
783,2518-154825-0003.flac,safe with a discharged pistol in our grasp and a shot man lying at our feet elzevir was the first to speak can you stand john is the bone broken
784,2518-154825-0012.flac,there is yet another way that we may try and if thou hadst but two whole legs i would have tried it and now tis a little short of madness and yet if thou fearest not i will still try it
785,2518-154825-0037.flac,and then while he knelt down upon the path
786,2518-154825-0026.flac,so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
787,2518-154825-0052.flac,now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path
788,2518-154825-0031.flac,but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again
789,2518-154825-0045.flac,and in five more they will be on the under cliff and if we ever reach the top who knows but they have left a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag and if they knew
790,2518-154825-0049.flac,i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gull seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said
791,2518-154825-0028.flac,and not a man in all the world to do it with a full grown lad in his arms yet elzevir made no bones of it nor spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot
792,2518-154825-0019.flac,and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the under cliff
793,2518-154825-0014.flac,where the undercliff dies back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it and of men
794,2518-154825-0000.flac,how fearful and dizzy tis to cast one eyes so low i'll look no more
795,2518-154825-0048.flac,i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes
796,2518-154825-0013.flac,just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle path leads down but not a hundred yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts
797,2518-154825-0043.flac,i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint
798,2518-154825-0025.flac,will keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning
799,2518-154825-0021.flac,for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face
800,2518-154825-0054.flac,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright a falling left me in a moment
801,2518-154825-0023.flac,and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and tis too late now to change counsel
802,2518-154825-0044.flac,so i gave out one two three and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself though his words seemed thin and far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here
803,2518-154825-0020.flac,and twas a task that might cow the bravest and when i looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below
804,2518-154825-0016.flac,yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry thee some way and where there is no room to carry
805,2518-154825-0011.flac,so only gave a sigh wishing heartily that maskew were not dead and that my leg were not broke but that i was back again at the whynot or even hearing one of doctor sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlour
806,2518-154825-0009.flac,and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a charge in air so one thing we can do is to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg
807,2518-154826-0001.flac,with the straight sun path across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken
808,2518-154826-0003.flac,and i fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second
809,2518-154826-0034.flac,and so i said as much to elzevir who only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough
810,2518-154826-0009.flac,that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
811,2518-154826-0044.flac,though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peering out at the top of the mound there were many tumble down walls and low gables left at the cottages of the old quarrymen grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds
812,2518-154826-0026.flac,but elzevir passed him the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer top was the answer
813,2518-154826-0035.flac,but when elzevir sat down the boy gave a careful look round and seeing no one watching any more
814,2518-154826-0041.flac,and i am told in other parts of england as well and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned a skew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then
815,2518-154826-0020.flac,then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
816,2518-154826-0018.flac,and now that i was under the lee of the wall
817,2518-154826-0038.flac,and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again
818,2518-154826-0015.flac,so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up
819,2518-154826-0037.flac,we must have slept three hours or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john tis when the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posse might have had us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with he lusty stride
820,2518-154826-0029.flac,and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
821,2518-154826-0048.flac,and the sward crept over the edges of the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps
822,2518-154826-0042.flac,from the bottom of this shaft there a spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly six feet high but sometimes only three or four and in these the marble is dug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves
823,2518-154826-0040.flac,although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbec marble which you see in old church is in our country
824,2518-154826-0045.flac,and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush
825,2518-154826-0021.flac,that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones then i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty
826,2518-154826-0047.flac,for if it were not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low
827,2518-154826-0012.flac,behind one of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush elzvir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry thee no farther for this present
828,2518-154826-0014.flac,and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now tis different
829,2518-154826-0052.flac,he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand
830,2518-154826-0043.flac,which was just putting on the brighter green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment had covered for the most part
831,2518-154826-0016.flac,i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound and he took maskew's silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly
832,2518-154826-0039.flac,elzevir was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of vanville point
833,2518-154826-0050.flac,and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as one goes down a hatchway
834,2518-154826-0022.flac,but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
835,2518-154826-0033.flac,these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hillside come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
836,2518-154826-0006.flac,and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
837,2518-154826-0025.flac,we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall and so elzevir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off
838,2518-154826-0008.flac,and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish
839,2518-154826-0046.flac,on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of these shafts
840,2518-154826-0000.flac,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver gray film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
841,2518-154826-0027.flac,have you got a charge of powder to spare said elzevir showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows he whispered to me to lie still
842,2518-154826-0005.flac,there came before my eyes that gray face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of a sleep
843,2518-154826-0031.flac,the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion
844,2518-154826-0028.flac,no time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy
845,2518-154826-0036.flac,then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hill brow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is past already
846,2518-154826-0054.flac,and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and lit a match
847,2518-154826-0051.flac,and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
848,2518-154826-0017.flac,with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west
849,2518-154826-0023.flac,and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
850,2518-154826-0030.flac,but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or a buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more said elzevir the tempter
851,2518-154826-0007.flac,this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in perbec which they call joseph's pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there
852,2518-154826-0010.flac,it was afternoon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
853,2518-154826-0024.flac,enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall
854,2518-154826-0053.flac,and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down
855,2518-154826-0011.flac,the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
856,2518-154826-0049.flac,there he said this is joseph's pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry
857,2518-154826-0002.flac,and the wind which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seemed now but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew apace
858,2518-154826-0032.flac,for while he spoke i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied around my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the fire lock
859,2518-154826-0004.flac,there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all
860,2518-154826-0019.flac,and gets at length into the shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzevir i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to lull me to slumber
861,2518-154826-0013.flac,though there is not now much farther to go we have passed perbek gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon
862,4830-25904-0023.flac,he wouldn't touch his dinner but lay down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger till his mate could share it with him
863,4830-25904-0048.flac,its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command
864,4830-25904-0005.flac,so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelikans i never knew before what handsome birds they were not graceful but with such snowy plumage tinged with pale pink and faint yellow
865,4830-25904-0003.flac,and i was so glad to meet with any one from home that i'd have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me he didn't however
866,4830-25904-0045.flac,on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes chasing one another
867,4830-25904-0010.flac,i liked this lion very much for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro
868,4830-25904-0006.flac,they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills
869,4830-25904-0008.flac,and there found a splendid sight six lyons and lionesses in three or four different cages sitting or standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes
870,4830-25904-0025.flac,as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here was every variety from the great ugly chimpansie to the funny little fellows
871,4830-25904-0027.flac,he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at everyone like an ill tempered old bachelor half a dozen little ones teased him capitally by dropping bits of bread
872,4830-25904-0016.flac,gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic
873,4830-25904-0047.flac,and came at the keeper's call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had four fins instead of two
874,4830-25904-0020.flac,the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more
875,4830-25904-0028.flac,nut shells and straw down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail i'm afraid the gray one bit it off
876,4830-25904-0029.flac,and kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldn't hold him and down he'd go
877,4830-25904-0040.flac,and then knotted his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fiery eyed head in the middle he was not one of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits
878,4830-25904-0049.flac,the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water or sitting on a block of ice panting as if the mild spring day was blazing midsummer
879,4830-25904-0030.flac,bounce on to the straw at first he'd sit and stare abvout him as if much amazed to find himself there then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys
880,4830-25904-0007.flac,when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it until the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen
881,4830-25904-0044.flac,hoping to find something eatable i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees flocks of snow white crane stalking over the grass
882,4830-25904-0035.flac,best when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wondered i hope he hasn't got
883,4830-25904-0031.flac,and finally he'd examine his poor little tail and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much
884,4830-25904-0017.flac,for they tumbled one over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders
885,4830-25904-0015.flac,this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line
886,4830-25904-0026.flac,who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers amamma sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the gray monkey with the blue nose scolded at me
887,4830-25904-0012.flac,it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and everyone laughed at the sound there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species
888,4830-25904-0000.flac,being alone in london yet wishing to celebrate the day i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoological gardens a lovely place it was and i enjoyed myself immensely for mayday in england is just what it should be
889,4830-25904-0033.flac,since i had a tame green one who lived under the doorstep and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out and i wasn't allowed to poke them
890,4830-25904-0041.flac,which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive i was walking toward the camel's pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face it's the boa i thought
891,4830-25904-0037.flac,as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boa's glittering eyes
892,4830-25904-0018.flac,one lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw and he clutched it trying to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming
893,4830-25904-0011.flac,some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head
894,4830-25904-0043.flac,i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket
895,4830-25904-0019.flac,as if the whole family of wild beasts were after her
896,4830-25904-0038.flac,and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainous looking reptile he was and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country
897,4830-25904-0002.flac,for the birds and beasts are so skilfully arranged that it is more like travelling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a managerie the first thing i saw was a great american bicin
898,4830-25904-0021.flac,one little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner which was an example to the rest the lions ate in dignified silence
899,4830-25904-0042.flac,much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge
900,4830-25904-0032.flac,and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away the snake house came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoscerous family i rather like snakes
901,4830-25904-0001.flac,mild sunny flowery and spring like as i walked along the well kept paths between white and rosy hawthorn hedges i kept coming upon new and curious sights
902,4830-25904-0014.flac,and all to get very much excited about something sniffing at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till
903,4830-25904-0046.flac,and in an immense wire covered avery all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as gaily as if at home one of the curiosities was a sea cow who lived in a tank of salt water
904,4830-25904-0036.flac,out i said to myself thinking of a story i read once of a person in a monagerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding toward him
905,4830-25904-0004.flac,and put down his immense head with a sullen snort as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost
906,4830-25904-0034.flac,and blinked at me through the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakes black brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain ones but i liked the great boa
907,4830-25904-0050.flac,he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw
908,4830-25904-0022.flac,all but my favorite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned away with a plaintive moan which seemed to grieve him sadly
909,4830-25904-0013.flac,i sat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl
910,4830-25904-0009.flac,one lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering
911,4830-25904-0024.flac,as i took a last look at his fine old face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad douglas douglas tender and true
912,4830-25904-0039.flac,where such unpleasant neighbours might pop in upon you unexpectedly he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself
913,4830-25898-0037.flac,don't flap and stagger so let me hold you taste this mint leaf have a drop of water what shall i do as poor missus cluck sighed and sobbed her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back
914,4830-25898-0050.flac,but it was a long way and dusk came on before the red farm house appeared now i'm safe thank you very much won't you come in and stay all night my mother will be glad to see you
915,4830-25898-0011.flac,what a nice time speckle did have to be sure for the grasshoppers were lively and fat and aunt was in an unusually amiable mood never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it
916,4830-25898-0001.flac,and no sooner were they out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as gaily as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their especial benefit it was a fine brood
917,4830-25898-0024.flac,for some time after this missus cluck kept her three remaining little ones close to her side watching over them with maternal care till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings peep and peck were always together
918,4830-25898-0007.flac,which ended in chanty's utter defeat for he died from his wounds downy and snowballs soon followed for the two sweet little things would swing on the burdock leaves that grew over the brook
919,4830-25898-0054.flac,to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her but the bough of a leafless tree too stiff and weak to fly up she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the doorstep
920,4830-25898-0022.flac,came of it and all the chicks laughed that made strut mad and he resolved to crow even if he killed himself doing it he gave an angry cluck flapped his wings and tried again alas alas
921,4830-25898-0016.flac,for every fowl in the yard twitted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice
922,4830-25898-0008.flac,sitting side by side the plump sisters were placidly swaying up and down over the clear brown water rippling below when ah sad to relate the stem broke and down went leaf
923,4830-25898-0012.flac,like a brave chick said the old biddy as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark
924,4830-25898-0035.flac,there peck stopped suddenly rolled up her eyes and began to stagger about as if she was tipsy mercy on us what's the matter with the chick cried missus cluck in great alarm fits ma'am answered doctor drake
925,4830-25898-0029.flac,and having taken a taste of everything she was about to leave when she heard the stableman coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the meal bin and hid herself
926,4830-25898-0036.flac,who just then waddled by oh what can i do screamed the distressed hen nothing ma'am it's fatal and the doctor waddled on to visit dame partlet's son who was ill of the pip my child my child
927,4830-25898-0000.flac,there never was a prouder mamma than madame cluck when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks chanticleer struct snow ball speck peep peck downy and blot were their names
928,4830-25898-0032.flac,she strayed into the sheep shed and finding some salt ate as much as she liked not knowing that salt is bad for hens having taken all she wanted she ran back to the barn
929,4830-25898-0002.flac,but poor madame cluck had bad luck with her chicks for they were her first and she didn't know how to manage them old aunt cockletop told her that she didn't and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends
930,4830-25898-0048.flac,blot saw a little kitten mewing pitifully as it sat under the fence what is the matter dear asked kind blot
931,4830-25898-0053.flac,and colder and colder became poor blot's little feet as she waded through the drifts the firelight was shining out into the gloom
932,4830-25898-0045.flac,aunt cockletop pecked and croaked fiercely but tough as she was the old biddy did not escape and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand
933,4830-25898-0031.flac,with her poor little claws sticking straight up as if imploring help peck meanwhile got into mischief also
934,4830-25898-0039.flac,and the bereaved parent wore a black string around her leg for a month blot the last of that bright band needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow this was the reason why her mother never
935,4830-25898-0018.flac,till his throat quite ached with the effort ah if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear i should be perfectly happy said thes silly little fowl
936,4830-25898-0020.flac,you'll fall and get hurt said his sister blot hold your tongue you ugly little thing and don't talk to me i'm going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen be quiet down there
937,4830-25898-0023.flac,for poor strutt he leaned so far forward in his frantic effort to get a big crow out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor killing himself instantly
938,4830-25898-0040.flac,had loved her as much as she did the others who were all white gray or yellow poor little blot had been much neglected by everyone but now her lonely mamma discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was
939,4830-25898-0055.flac,and with a shiver put her little head under her wing trying to forget hunger weariness and the bitter cold and wait patiently for morning but when morning came little blot lay frozen stiff under a coverlet of snow
940,4830-25898-0021.flac,and hear if i can't do it as well as daddy the chicks stopped scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear strut crow perching himself on the beam he tried his best
941,4830-25898-0052.flac,so good bye dear and off trotted blot along the snowy road hoping to get home before the hen house door was shut faster and faster fell the snow darker and darker grew the night
942,4830-25898-0014.flac,and unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away chirping dismally
943,4830-25898-0003.flac,aunt cockletop was right as you will see when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family the tragedy began with chanty who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow
944,4830-25898-0044.flac,and peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pulled her off screaming dolefully
945,4830-25898-0027.flac,and can't look after you just now said their mother one day yes ma'am chirped the chickens and then as she went rustling into the haymow they began to run about and enjoy themselves with all their might
946,4830-25898-0025.flac,being very fond of one another peep was a most inquisitive chicken poking her head into every nook and corner and never satisfied till she had seen all there was to see peck was a glutton
947,4830-25898-0013.flac,the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give one loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her little speckle remembering the advice
948,4830-25898-0034.flac,where is peep asked missus cluck
949,4830-25898-0030.flac,sam never saw her but shut down the cover of the bin as he passed and left poor peep to die no one knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal
950,4830-25898-0043.flac,and were seen by their surviving relatives featherless pale and stiff borne away to some unknown place whence no fowl returned blot was waked one night by a great cackling and fluttering in the hen house
951,4830-25898-0042.flac,they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farmyard for turkeys hens ducks and geese fell a prey to it
952,4830-25898-0038.flac,gasping and rolling up her eyes in great angush for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt and there was no help for her when all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush covered the little grave with chickweed
953,4830-25898-0009.flac,chickens and all to a watery death i'm the most unlucky hand ever hatched groaned
954,4830-25898-0006.flac,chante thought he could beat mister bantam easily he was so small and invited him to fight mister b declined then chanty called him a coward and gave missus b a peck
955,4830-25898-0051.flac,said the kit rubbing her soft white face against bloth's little black breast
956,4830-25898-0019.flac,so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmate sat below and watched him
957,4830-25898-0015.flac,what shall i do it was a dreadful blow to missus cluck and aunt cockletop didn't show herself for a whole day after that story was known
958,4830-25898-0017.flac,he was at it from morning till night and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill small voice make funny attempts to produce hoarse little crows as he sat on the wall and stretchd his yellow neck
959,4830-25898-0046.flac,in the morning few remained and blot felt that she was a forlorn orphan a thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours brooding over her sad lot
960,4830-25898-0004.flac,before he had a feather to his bit of a tail chanty began to fight and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farmyard having pecked his brothers and sisters he tried to do the same to his playmates
961,4830-25898-0010.flac,and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with aunt cockletop grasshoppering they called it in the great field across the road
962,4830-25898-0026.flac,eating everything she could find and often making herself ill by gobbling too fast and forgetting to eat a little gravel to help digest her food don't go out of the barn children i'm going to lay an egg
963,4830-25898-0041.flac,for blot was a great comfort to her never running away or disobeying in any way but always close to her side ready to creep under her wing or bring her a plump bug when the poor biddy's appetite failed her
964,4830-25898-0028.flac,peep found a little hole into the meal room and slipped in full of joy at the sight of the bags boxes and bins i'll eat all i want and then i'll call peck she said
965,4830-25898-0005.flac,the ducklings gosslings and young turkeys and was so disagreeable that all the fowls hated him one day a pair of bantams arrived pretty little white birds with red crests and nice yellow feet
966,4830-25898-0047.flac,and longing to join her family in some safe and happy land where fowls lived in peace she had her wish very soon for one day when the first snowflakes began to flutter
967,4830-25898-0033.flac,and was innocently catching gnats when her mamma came out of the hay mon with a loud cut cut cut
968,2893-139322-0048.flac,you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them suppose this is only a rumor
969,2893-139322-0049.flac,it sounds true said asano let us have the facts said graham
970,2893-139322-0039.flac,they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices
971,2893-139322-0031.flac,the policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things
972,2893-139322-0021.flac,for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this on coming to work but at night
973,2893-139322-0016.flac,they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits
974,2893-139322-0023.flac,many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion asano apologized to graham for this offensive sight but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route
975,2893-139322-0015.flac,had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honor and a high morality now it was differentiating into an indistinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own even with a dialect of its own
976,2893-139322-0007.flac,the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless reaked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation
977,2893-139322-0004.flac,struck graham most vividly one lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut
978,2893-139322-0001.flac,on their way the platform crossed the thames twice and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid
979,2893-139322-0022.flac,in spite of every precaution the labord policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby
980,2893-139322-0027.flac,by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of whitewashed wall
981,2893-139322-0033.flac,the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pin point lights here was the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery
982,2893-139322-0050.flac,even now the ruins may be impassable graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one and there asano accosted a laborer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech what did he say asked graham
983,2893-139322-0047.flac,he said i might have known the hour has come he thought swiftly what am i to do go back to the council house said asano why should i not appeal the people are here
984,2893-139322-0051.flac,had not some one in the windvane offices learnt he said a girl a girl not he said a girl he did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins
985,2893-139322-0029.flac,their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing stop that shouted one of the policemen but the order was disobeyed
986,2893-139322-0011.flac,the latter day laborer male as well as female was essentially a machine minder and feeder a servant an attendant or an artist under direction the women in comparison with those graham remembered
987,2893-139322-0002.flac,the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights a string of black barges passed seaward manned by blue clad men
988,2893-139322-0018.flac,he came to the warren of the jewellers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree
989,2893-139322-0038.flac,but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms
990,2893-139322-0000.flac,chapter twenty one the under side from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufactures was done
991,2893-139322-0025.flac,graham made some indignant comments but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years
992,2893-139322-0009.flac,the voluntary vigours of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter day workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and for women
993,2893-139322-0010.flac,who were directing their labors the burly laborers of the old victorian times had followed that dray horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine
994,2893-139322-0052.flac,and then another thing was shouted something that turned in aimless tumult into determinate movements it came like a wind along the street
995,2893-139322-0017.flac,the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they an their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways
996,2893-139322-0044.flac,he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream
997,2893-139322-0032.flac,that walk left on graham's mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery
998,2893-139322-0045.flac,he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past
999,2893-139322-0012.flac,whereas a class distinctly plain and flat chested two hundred years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion two hundred years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigor from the blue canvas myriads
1000,2893-139322-0006.flac,the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuit making place of the potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers
1001,2893-139322-0040.flac,then a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran what has happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting
1002,2893-139322-0035.flac,even as these enemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation once and again and again a third time
1003,2893-139322-0043.flac,and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms towards him bawling again and again in good english this is ostrog's doing ostrog the knave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse
1004,2893-139322-0005.flac,and blotted out the picture presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared
1005,2893-139322-0014.flac,to the euthenazi and peace to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities of graham's former life the newly aggregated laboring mass
1006,2893-139322-0024.flac,this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement she might have done better with herself than that said asano
1007,2893-139322-0041.flac,that men yelled to one another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police
1008,2893-139322-0037.flac,when he saw a number of blue clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labor police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder
1009,2893-139322-0042.flac,he hesitated looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew but how can they know asked asano graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work
1010,2893-139322-0003.flac,the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labor department was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks
1011,2893-139322-0034.flac,and here unprecedented reeks everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world
1012,2893-139322-0036.flac,graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again
1013,2893-139322-0019.flac,each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow
1014,2893-139322-0008.flac,but wherever there was work it was being done by slow moving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work places and the orange clad labor police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls
1015,2893-139322-0030.flac,and first one and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp
1016,2893-139322-0020.flac,had the oddest effect the work was beautifully executed
1017,2893-139322-0046.flac,the master is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent
1018,2893-139322-0026.flac,and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen three barges smothered in flowery dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar
1019,2893-139322-0028.flac,every now and then one would stop to cough a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky
1020,2893-139322-0013.flac,to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendors and delights and at last
1021,2893-139310-0001.flac,a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre
1022,2893-139310-0045.flac,a tall sallow dark haired shining eyed youth white clad from top to toe clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down again and receded looking backward heads shoulders
1023,2893-139310-0005.flac,he grasped the arm of this shouting person tell me he cried who am i who am i the others came nearer to hear his words
1024,2893-139310-0016.flac,he's at the wind vane offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannized at last even in my name my name master
1025,2893-139310-0052.flac,attendants intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left before him went the backs of the guards in black three and three and three he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway
1026,2893-139310-0023.flac,on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
1027,2893-139310-0002.flac,behind the man was a girl in a silvery gray robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
1028,2893-139310-0027.flac,a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth
1029,2893-139310-0051.flac,the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet he was aware of a path before him of a suite about him of guards and dignities and lincoln on his right hand
1030,2893-139310-0035.flac,he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant she became to him flushed and eager as she was an embodiment of the song
1031,2893-139310-0025.flac,but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him
1032,2893-139310-0018.flac,no one expected you to wake they were cunning damned tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotize you or kill you again the hall dominated everything ostrog is at the windvane offices ready
1033,2893-139310-0014.flac,our leader in your name in my name
1034,2893-139310-0029.flac,but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of
1035,2893-139310-0019.flac,even now there's a rumor of fighting beginning the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him ostrog has it planned trust him we have our organizations ready we shall seize the flying stages
1036,2893-139310-0015.flac,why is he not here he has deputed us i am his brother his half brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent
1037,2893-139310-0021.flac,massed in the inaudible it is now er never the council is rocking they cannot trust even their drilled men hear the people calling to you graham's mind was like a night of moon in swift clouds
1038,2893-139310-0053.flac,with the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up at him he did not know whither he went he did not want to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall
1039,2893-139310-0047.flac,most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly white and disease was there and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean men and women of the new age strange and incredible meeting as the broad stream passed before him to the right
1040,2893-139310-0000.flac,the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was glowing
1041,2893-139310-0008.flac,it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me
1042,2893-139310-0034.flac,wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtly folded mantle hung from his shoulders
1043,2893-139310-0033.flac,the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred him emboldened him the hall opened to him
1044,2893-139310-0044.flac,a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right he perceived a blue clad negro a shrivelled woman in yellow then a group of tall fair haired white faced blue clad men pushed theatrically past him he noted two chinamen
1045,2893-139310-0028.flac,he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed
1046,2893-139310-0042.flac,march his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward they were no longer marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp tramp in that host
1047,2893-139310-0024.flac,monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamoring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him
1048,2893-139310-0032.flac,full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating time tramp tramp he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically
1049,2893-139310-0046.flac,hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there eyes met his and passed and vanished men gesticulated to him shouted in audible personal things
1050,2893-139310-0012.flac,the people in the little room could not hear each other shout graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him
1051,2893-139310-0031.flac,the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music music like the music of an organ
1052,2893-139310-0003.flac,a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch
1053,2893-139310-0039.flac,her hair acrosse her face and brandishing a green staff next this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind shouted a harless face a great cavity of toothless mouth a voice called
1054,2893-139310-0037.flac,the hall was a vast and intricate space galleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity
1055,2893-139310-0010.flac,because you are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name the sounds from the hall had died into a silence
1056,2893-139310-0004.flac,and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly
1057,2893-139310-0006.flac,his eyes searched their faces they have told him nothing cried the girl tell me tell me cried graham you are the master of the earth you are owner of the world
1058,2893-139310-0043.flac,were bearded men old men youths fluttering robed bare armed women girls men and women of the new age rich robes gray rags fluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant blue
1059,2893-139310-0011.flac,threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult a roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted
1060,2893-139310-0017.flac,the young man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder
1061,2893-139310-0049.flac,mingled in the ranks tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was tramping the garments waved onward the faces poured by more abundantly tramp tramp tramp tramp
1062,2893-139310-0036.flac,he emerged in the alcove again incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting guided by lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people
1063,2893-139310-0020.flac,even now he may be doing that then this public theatre bawled the man in yellow it's only a contingent we have five myriads of drilled men we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a leader
1064,2893-139310-0013.flac,but who is ostrog he said
1065,2893-139310-0040.flac,ostrog all his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song the multitude were beating time with their feet marking time tramp tramp tramp tramp the great weapons waved
1066,2893-139310-0048.flac,tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward an an incessant replacement of people tramp tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages men and women
1067,2893-139310-0022.flac,now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism
1068,2893-139310-0007.flac,he did not believe he heard a right he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i have been awake three days a prisoner three days
1069,2893-139310-0041.flac,flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him passing towards a great archway shouting to the council tramp tramp tramp tramp he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled
1070,2893-139310-0009.flac,counsellors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference
1071,2893-139310-0030.flac,lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song
1072,2893-139310-0050.flac,at lincoln's pressure he turned toward the archway walking unconsciously in that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it the multitude the gesture and song all moved in that direction
1073,2893-139310-0026.flac,and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were bawling for order silence
1074,78-369-0054.flac,when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey
1075,78-369-0020.flac,that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate
1076,78-369-0061.flac,oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the demon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do
1077,78-369-0055.flac,my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before
1078,78-369-0035.flac,will satisfy my everlasting hatred my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words
1079,78-369-0015.flac,i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards a spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp
1080,78-369-0038.flac,the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down
1081,78-369-0037.flac,oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness
1082,78-369-0062.flac,swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no
1083,78-369-0059.flac,i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship
1084,78-369-0053.flac,warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the demon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until
1085,78-369-0029.flac,these words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north
1086,78-369-0049.flac,i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes
1087,78-369-0034.flac,one inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toil is only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings
1088,78-369-0022.flac,i always presented o those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy oh blessed sleep
1089,78-369-0025.flac,heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come
1090,78-369-0063.flac,sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broke yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish
1091,78-369-0041.flac,and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants
1092,78-369-0023.flac,often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage
1093,78-369-0016.flac,suddenly the broad disc of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task
1094,78-369-0052.flac,what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within
1095,78-369-0018.flac,the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown
1096,78-369-0030.flac,where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare
1097,78-369-0056.flac,as with the mighty shock of an earthquake split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy
1098,78-369-0044.flac,he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured
1099,78-369-0026.flac,and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonizing fondness did i feel for them
1100,78-369-0043.flac,through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs
1101,78-369-0019.flac,would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sunk under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert
1102,78-369-0027.flac,and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the demon more as a task enjoined by heaven
1103,78-369-0036.flac,and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon
1104,78-369-0017.flac,scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me
1105,78-369-0046.flac,my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge
1106,78-369-0039.flac,and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirits for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversari's gibe to meet and grapple with him
1107,78-369-0051.flac,gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain
1108,78-369-0048.flac,which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
1109,78-369-0028.flac,as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know
1110,78-369-0032.flac,the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most harty ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice
1111,78-369-0050.flac,despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil
1112,78-369-0058.flac,several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor
1113,78-369-0045.flac,amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant
1114,78-369-0031.flac,again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy
1115,78-369-0047.flac,i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment
1116,78-369-0040.flac,some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed
1117,78-369-0057.flac,and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death
1118,78-369-0024.flac,during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father
1119,78-369-0060.flac,but your direction was northward you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled
1120,78-369-0021.flac,and vanish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the demon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected
1121,78-369-0033.flac,and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off fom my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours
1122,78-369-0042.flac,concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage
1123,78-369-0002.flac,i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life
1124,78-369-0003.flac,all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know
1125,78-369-0008.flac,their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth
1126,78-369-0007.flac,and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around
1127,78-369-0005.flac,uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it
1128,78-369-0011.flac,deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends
1129,78-369-0014.flac,and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a well known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear
1130,78-369-0012.flac,heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance
1131,78-369-0004.flac,and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dare not die and leave my adversary in being when i quitted geneva my first labour
1132,78-369-0001.flac,my first resolution was to quit geneva forever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful
1133,78-369-0006.flac,and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn
1134,78-369-0013.flac,it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains re echoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter
1135,78-369-0000.flac,chapter twenty four my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury
1136,78-369-0009.flac,on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the demon
1137,78-369-0010.flac,which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work
1138,78-368-0052.flac,i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed
1139,78-368-0002.flac,the cloud swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless ways
1140,78-368-0047.flac,and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he
1141,78-368-0051.flac,my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction
1142,78-368-0039.flac,and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now relate my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy
1143,78-368-0007.flac,great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope
1144,78-368-0036.flac,and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer
1145,78-368-0001.flac,the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend
1146,78-368-0035.flac,revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose
1147,78-368-0021.flac,subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine
1148,78-368-0005.flac,when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended
1149,78-368-0017.flac,after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceedd a short distance from the house
1150,78-368-0029.flac,and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father an earnest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore
1151,78-368-0040.flac,and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested
1152,78-368-0015.flac,but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room
1153,78-368-0012.flac,but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck
1154,78-368-0006.flac,i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs the state lasted but for an instant
1155,78-368-0018.flac,a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room
1156,78-368-0000.flac,chapter twenty three it was eight o'clock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn
1157,78-368-0013.flac,and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described
1158,78-368-0041.flac,when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power
1159,78-368-0025.flac,however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night
1160,78-368-0044.flac,who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude
1161,78-368-0008.flac,she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms in relaxed form
1162,78-368-0010.flac,but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them
1163,78-368-0024.flac,there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents
1164,78-368-0004.flac,and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence
1165,78-368-0034.flac,and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great
1166,78-368-0053.flac,how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease
1167,78-368-0016.flac,nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless
1168,78-368-0009.flac,flung by the murderer on its bridal beer could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated
1169,78-368-0048.flac,i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you
1170,78-368-0026.flac,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man
1171,78-368-0028.flac,know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted
1172,78-368-0031.flac,sometimes indeed i dreamt that i waed
1173,78-368-0030.flac,misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way
1174,78-368-0019.flac,as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i rose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it
1175,78-368-0043.flac,i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance
1176,78-368-0050.flac,but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice
1177,78-368-0037.flac,however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood
1178,78-368-0033.flac,the monster whom i had created the miserable demon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him
1179,78-368-0045.flac,since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit
1180,78-368-0011.flac,to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her
1181,78-368-0020.flac,and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind
1182,78-368-0042.flac,from the execution of those functions on this occasion
1183,78-368-0032.flac,melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation
1184,78-368-0027.flac,but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate
1185,78-368-0049.flac,have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be
1186,78-368-0022.flac,the murder of clarval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend
1187,78-368-0046.flac,and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative
1188,78-368-0038.flac,my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive
1189,78-368-0023.flac,my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and earnest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action
1190,78-368-0014.flac,i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife
1191,78-368-0003.flac,that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects
1192,4853-29413-0027.flac,a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we haven't heard of yet mister roylake i had been dressing for some time past longing to see cristel it is needless to say
1193,4853-29413-0031.flac,had we any proof to justify us gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boat house no oars no oars
1194,4853-29413-0024.flac,how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them
1195,4853-29413-0026.flac,i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was honest honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor
1196,4853-29413-0019.flac,it was borne in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police
1197,4853-29413-0012.flac,the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming
1198,4853-29413-0009.flac,what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause
1199,4853-29413-0015.flac,but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned
1200,4853-29413-0018.flac,that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain
1201,4853-29413-0022.flac,she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who is trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen
1202,4853-29413-0030.flac,i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars
1203,4853-29413-0011.flac,the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll answer them to the best of my ability
1204,4853-29413-0028.flac,is there anything more i asked that i ought to know only one thing mister roylake that i can think of gloody replied i'm afraid it's miss cristel's turn next what do you mean
1205,4853-29413-0013.flac,the cur had betrayed himself it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested
1206,4853-29413-0032.flac,and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me nothing sir
1207,4853-29413-0017.flac,a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time
1208,4853-29413-0016.flac,gloody was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party
1209,4853-29413-0021.flac,that she was true as steel and not easily frightened i didn't need to guess i knew it gloody had done his best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded
1210,4853-29413-0020.flac,the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of you i don't mean any offence sir i pretty well guessed
1211,4853-29413-0014.flac,to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed
1212,4853-29413-0025.flac,i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said
1213,4853-29413-0010.flac,we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little
1214,4853-29413-0029.flac,well the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and is eye is on miss cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars
1215,4853-29413-0023.flac,whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea yes well that was one of the signals agreed on between us
1216,4853-29413-0005.flac,i'm dismissed from my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked
1217,4853-29413-0003.flac,the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me gloody showed himself at the door
1218,4853-29413-0000.flac,gloody settles the account a night of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened
1219,4853-29413-0006.flac,what did he do flew into a furious rage i don't complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window
1220,4853-29413-0002.flac,the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom
1221,4853-29413-0007.flac,even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mister roylake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you only i don't know how
1222,4853-29413-0008.flac,in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us to is settled now on both sides
1223,4853-29413-0004.flac,with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir
1224,4853-29413-0001.flac,the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell
1225,4853-27670-0025.flac,until coming abreast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosy there was a wound over his right brow
1226,4853-27670-0028.flac,for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other year against which leaned a portion of the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away
1227,4853-27670-0029.flac,i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seaman named abraham wise near the fore hatch
1228,4853-27670-0022.flac,nevertheless its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth
1229,4853-27670-0005.flac,the brig pitched and rolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in
1230,4853-27670-0011.flac,but no feature of my lamentable situation so affrighted me so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for one companion
1231,4853-27670-0003.flac,it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest color upon the hatchway one thing i quickly noticed that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze
1232,4853-27670-0001.flac,i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone
1233,4853-27670-0021.flac,i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small handlantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log
1234,4853-27670-0035.flac,i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing
1235,4853-27670-0033.flac,nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless
1236,4853-27670-0016.flac,by preventing the seas which washed on to the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side
1237,4853-27670-0009.flac,my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness
1238,4853-27670-0006.flac,it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out
1239,4853-27670-0031.flac,but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses
1240,4853-27670-0002.flac,my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armour so inflexibly hard were they frozen yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins
1241,4853-27670-0036.flac,and even had i managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned
1242,4853-27670-0034.flac,to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easily have kept her free
1243,4853-27670-0026.flac,and as if that had not suffaced to slay him the fall of the masts had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly
1244,4853-27670-0017.flac,my eyes directly sought it and found the time twenty minutes after ten this signified that i had ten or eleven hours of darkness before me
1245,4853-27670-0024.flac,i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull
1246,4853-27670-0023.flac,but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea
1247,4853-27670-0010.flac,it was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round
1248,4853-27670-0032.flac,i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside weighty enough you would have supposed to stave the ship
1249,4853-27670-0008.flac,what has come to pass is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard certainly five men at least were living before we fouled the ice and again i cried out is there any one alive
1250,4853-27670-0012.flac,even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech nay god himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not the blackness lay like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul
1251,4853-27670-0007.flac,finding that i had the use of my voice i halloed as loudly as i could but no human note responded three or four times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought
1252,4853-27670-0004.flac,there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley
1253,4853-27670-0014.flac,reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas and that after all
1254,4853-27670-0000.flac,i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvellous
1255,4853-27670-0019.flac,i swallowed half a pannikin of the hollans for the sake of the warmth and life of the draught and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them
1256,4853-27670-0015.flac,her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand
1257,4853-27670-0018.flac,i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew
1258,4853-27670-0027.flac,that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man under a mass of rigging in the larboard scuppers lay two bodies as i could just faintly discern
1259,4853-27670-0020.flac,and i then with a seaman's dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days
1260,4853-27670-0013.flac,misery and horror were within that shadow and beyond it nothing that my spirit could look up to i stood for some moments as one stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea
1261,4853-27670-0030.flac,no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea
1262,4853-27671-0027.flac,the boat was about fifteen feet long
1263,4853-27671-0013.flac,it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her and if the swell fell over her bous and filled the decks down she would go i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money
1264,4853-27671-0019.flac,i threw the oar over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her
1265,4853-27671-0037.flac,was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise
1266,4853-27671-0031.flac,than by sailing into the great desolation of the north west the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering
1267,4853-27671-0021.flac,and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her bulwarks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under
1268,4853-27671-0035.flac,lifting my eyes with involuntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies
1269,4853-27671-0036.flac,it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions and poised on tremorless wings
1270,4853-27671-0004.flac,one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks
1271,4853-27671-0025.flac,and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason i rose from the seat on to which i had sunk and loosed the sale
1272,4853-27671-0007.flac,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prized her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
1273,4853-27671-0026.flac,and hauling the sheet aft put the oar over the stern and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course the draught of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside
1274,4853-27671-0038.flac,the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me its eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies
1275,4853-27671-0024.flac,so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustained by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great
1276,4853-27671-0012.flac,the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue brows to her stem
1277,4853-27671-0015.flac,heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulder of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendor along
1278,4853-27671-0039.flac,it was as silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature
1279,4853-27671-0014.flac,when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her adrift the sun was an hour above the horizon
1280,4853-27671-0011.flac,eight or ten biscuits some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flour and thirteen bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat
1281,4853-27671-0001.flac,i had at one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise
1282,4853-27671-0022.flac,and which she dragged down with her on a sudden when the last fragment of mast had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea uprose a body with a sort of leap
1283,4853-27671-0033.flac,and then all was bare bald swelling sea and empearled sky darkening in lagoons of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapour lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon
1284,4853-27671-0010.flac,i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham
1285,4853-27671-0040.flac,it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope flapped its wings and after a turn or two
1286,4853-27671-0029.flac,where perchance i might meet a whaler or a south seaman from new holland but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american sea board indeed
1287,4853-27671-0009.flac,but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her
1288,4853-27671-0018.flac,with us had it dawned yesterday instead of to day my companions would have been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last
1289,4853-27671-0002.flac,and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail
1290,4853-27671-0030.flac,i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up and that though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts
1291,4853-27671-0017.flac,shot with pearly lustre floated overhead very high it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the air being dry its shrewdness was endurable
1292,4853-27671-0023.flac,it was the sailor that had lain drown on the starboard side of the forward deck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended
1293,4853-27671-0020.flac,into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hull floated she was something to hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon
1294,4853-27671-0003.flac,yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow
1295,4853-27671-0032.flac,i am persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly as the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck
1296,4853-27671-0034.flac,but one living thing there was besides myself a grey breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hull went down and then
1297,4853-27671-0006.flac,and there lay the longboat crushed into staves the signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates
1298,4853-27671-0028.flac,ere i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer north west and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea
1299,4853-27671-0000.flac,there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable pall overhead into blueness the hull lay very deep
1300,4853-27671-0005.flac,had floated the jolly boat out of the longboat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell
1301,4853-27671-0008.flac,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water
1302,4853-27671-0016.flac,till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover
1303,4018-107338-0012.flac,he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me
1304,4018-107338-0026.flac,there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephen's itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
1305,4018-107338-0031.flac,very useful no doubt i hope i shall find them but of no validity if money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter
1306,4018-107338-0009.flac,then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing
1307,4018-107338-0001.flac,perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things
1308,4018-107338-0010.flac,he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
1309,4018-107338-0017.flac,had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
1310,4018-107338-0020.flac,and yet if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
1311,4018-107338-0002.flac,and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
1312,4018-107338-0003.flac,and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears
1313,4018-107338-0029.flac,saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of justice that mowbray castle is as much yours
1314,4018-107338-0032.flac,i'll not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely fit for business
1315,4018-107338-0008.flac,is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
1316,4018-107338-0027.flac,my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believe that we had on our side god and the truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley
1317,4018-107338-0018.flac,you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil
1318,4018-107338-0016.flac,the mystification of which we had been dupes hand you did wrong said sybil there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here to day he met and addressed me and i only recognized an acquaintance
1319,4018-107338-0011.flac,this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
1320,4018-107338-0028.flac,the factions and the failures of our oppressors at this moment gerard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of sybil and morley
1321,4018-107338-0007.flac,is the privilege of the people of whom i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour their labour said sybil
1322,4018-107338-0025.flac,lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to degrade them
1323,4018-107338-0015.flac,hers were kind and calm and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
1324,4018-107338-0024.flac,morley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
1325,4018-107338-0004.flac,and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realized little of the fancies
1326,4018-107338-0000.flac,morley paused as he recognized egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
1327,4018-107338-0022.flac,you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well
1328,4018-107338-0023.flac,but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirit sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet
1329,4018-107338-0013.flac,he would propose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here
1330,4018-107338-0019.flac,he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
1331,4018-107338-0006.flac,detract from the favorable effect that he always at once produced
1332,4018-107338-0030.flac,as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land but can we prove it we never had the legal evidence you are an error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda
1333,4018-107338-0005.flac,that appearance was prepossessing a frank an even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
1334,4018-107338-0014.flac,you did well good stephen as you always do said sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
1335,4018-107338-0021.flac,the factions become united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
1336,4018-103416-0026.flac,not yet but of course i shall be when you really get going i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made i'm the most ignorant person you ever knew i'l be awfully glad to
1337,4018-103416-0003.flac,for the red cross and kindred activities but although the war was in the nation's mind it was not yet in its soul life went on much as before and abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency
1338,4018-103416-0018.flac,her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marion hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had
1339,4018-103416-0028.flac,he held himself very straight as he entered the house and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler had given place to a dignified nod natlie was in her dressing room at his knock she told the maid to admit him
1340,4018-103416-0022.flac,they met there smoked her cigarettes made love in a corner occasionally became engaged but she was of the game no longer in it men still came to see her a growing percentage of them married
1341,4018-103416-0017.flac,encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder
1342,4018-103416-0033.flac,she was holding out both hands to him piteously you wouldn't go would you i might have to go he evaded you wouldn't graham you're all i have all i have left to live for you wouldn't need to go it's ridiculous you're needed here
1343,4018-103416-0035.flac,and if we have you won't go promise me you won't go when he hesitated she resorted to her old methods with both clayton and the boy she was doing all she could to make them happy she made no demands none
1344,4018-103416-0038.flac,and she had helped him out of a hole just now all right i promise he said at last but you're worrying yourself for nothing mother she was quite content then cheered at once consulted the jewelled watch on her dressing table
1345,4018-103416-0029.flac,his new found maturity seemed to be slipping from him somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy honestly mother i'd rather go to father and tell him about it
1346,4018-103416-0012.flac,no twoots dear but i can easily mother marion explained
1347,4018-103416-0013.flac,well do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night not exactly but i meant them he looked up at her admiringly he was only a year from college and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debutants
1348,4018-103416-0014.flac,since the night before he had been rankling under a sense of youth was i pretty awful last night he asked you were very interesting and i imagine rather indiscreet
1349,4018-103416-0002.flac,kept its secret well and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce war was to most of the nation a great dramatic spectacle presented to them at breakfast and in the afternoon editions
1350,4018-103416-0009.flac,and tea cups on most of the furniture and half smoked cigarettes on everything that would hold them including the piano marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing room door
1351,4018-103416-0007.flac,he was rather bored now at the prospect he would have preferred going to the club to play billiards which was his custom of a late afternoon he drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed marion's invitation to get there before the crowd
1352,4018-103416-0011.flac,permeated with a faint scent of late afternoon high balls tommy marion called when she had settled herself yes from a distance did you leave your cigarette on the piano
1353,4018-103416-0024.flac,but more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd like natali spencer's stupid party the night before so she watched graham and listened he was a nice boy and a handsome one
1354,4018-103416-0021.flac,were now sending flowers to the debutants and cutting in on the younger men at balls her house was still a rendezvous but it was for couples like the ones who had pre emptied the drawing room the library and the music room that afternoon
1355,4018-103416-0005.flac,but again washington knew that the british and french losses at the psum had been frightful that the amount of lost territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the british islands was acute
1356,4018-103416-0010.flac,i kept the library as long as i could we can sit on the stairs if you like which they proceeded to do quite amiably from various open doors came subdued voices the air was pungent with tobacco smoke
1357,4018-103416-0027.flac,we'll go in and stir up some of the lovers she suggested and if tommy hale hasn't burned up the piano we can dance a bit you dance divinely you know it was after seven when he reached home he felt every inch a man
1358,4018-103416-0020.flac,she had the far vision of the calculating mind she knew that if the country entered the war every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer at twenty five she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers
1359,4018-103416-0036.flac,but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received graham listened
1360,4018-103416-0030.flac,she ignored his protest as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters i'm accustomed to it was her sole reply but her resigned voice brought her as it always had
1361,4018-103416-0015.flac,about the new war contracts oh business
1362,4018-103416-0032.flac,when at a sound in clayton's room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket have you noticed a change in your father since he came back her tone was so ominous that he started he's not sick is he
1363,4018-103416-0037.flac,she was a really pathetic figure crouched in her low chair and shaken with terror she must have a rather bad time there were so many things she dared not take to his father she brought them to him instead her small grievances
1364,4018-103416-0006.flac,that the submarine sinkings were colossal our peace was at a fearful cost and on the edge of this volcano america played when graham spencer left the mill that tuesday afternoon it was to visit marion hayden
1365,4018-103416-0008.flac,three cars before the house showed that she already had callers and indeed when the parlor maid opened the door a burst of laughter greeted him the hayden house was a general rendezvous there were usually by seven o'clock whisky and soda glasses
1366,4018-103416-0000.flac,the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one it was marked by an almost feverish gaiety as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self interest
1367,4018-103416-0034.flac,your father needs you he needs me the hell of a lot the boy muttered but he went over and stooping down kissed her trembling face don't worry about me he said lightly i don't think we've got spine enough to get into the mix up anyhow
1368,4018-103416-0031.flac,the ready tribute of the boy's sympathy sit down graham i want to talk to you he sat down still uneasily fingering the roll of bills
1369,4018-103416-0023.flac,they brought her sent her tribute flowers candy and cigarettes
1370,4018-103416-0001.flac,mills and factories took on new life labor were scarce and high it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure people played that they might not think washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved
1371,4018-103416-0016.flac,and i like big figures poor people always do has it really gone through i mean those things do slip up sometimes don't they it's gone through all right signed sealed and delivered
1372,4018-103416-0019.flac,was the beauty of youth only and that that was going late hours golf perhaps a little more champagne than was necessary at dinner's and the mornings found her almost plain and too
1373,4018-103416-0004.flac,the great six months battle of the psome with its million casualties was resulting favorably on the east the russians had made some gains there were wages that the germans would be done in the spring
1374,4018-103416-0025.flac,also he promised to be sole heir to a great business if the war only lasted long enough imagine you're knowing all those things she said admiringly you're a partner aren't you he flushed slightly
1375,4018-107312-0011.flac,or the mayor of mowbray at least wages said the man i wish you may get em those villains shuffle and screw have sarved me with another bait ticket and a pretty figure too
1376,4018-107312-0026.flac,she added in a lower tone well i have left mister trafford's mill said the girl that's a bad job said missus carey for those traffords are kind to their people
1377,4018-107312-0028.flac,and then i'm no scholar said the girl and never could take to learning and those traffords had so many schools learning is better than house and lands said missus carey though i'm no scholar myself but then in my time things was different
1378,4018-107312-0022.flac,to stop my tongue and fill my stomach by the token of which as my gal says she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all mowbray and here the youth drew himself up and thrust his hands into the side pockets of his pea jacket well
1379,4018-107312-0019.flac,a high crowned dark brown hat which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye well you need not be so fierce mother carey said the youth with an affected air of deprecation
1380,4018-107312-0001.flac,the dimensions of castle street were not unworthy of the metropolis it traversed a great portion of the town and was proportionately wide its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity
1381,4018-107312-0009.flac,the subterraneous nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest the bright and lively shops were crowded and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls
1382,4018-107312-0025.flac,said a good humoured voice it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped they were gaily dressed a light handkerchief tied under the chin their hair scrupulously arranged they wore coral necklaces and earrings of gold
1383,4018-107312-0010.flac,still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase and so it is widow said a little pale man wistfully come come it's getting late and your wife's ill you're a good soul
1384,4018-107312-0016.flac,weal indeed you look very like a soul as feeds on wheel continued missus carey in an undertone as her declining customer moved away well it gets late said the widow
1385,4018-107312-0003.flac,in the infancy of mowbray by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labours
1386,4018-107312-0036.flac,i was speaking of it to harriet last night
1387,4018-107312-0012.flac,oh the carnal monsters exclaimed the widow if their day don't come the bloody minded knaves and for small cops too small cops be hanged am i the man to send up a bad bottome cop widow carey

1391,4018-107312-0002.flac,while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses not as beautiful as the palaces of venice but in their way not less remarkable magnificent shops and here and there though rarely some ancient factory built among the fields
1392,4018-107312-0037.flac,i propose to go with her but two girls alone you understand me one does not like to be seen in these places as if one kept no company very true said mick and now we'll be off good night widow
1393,4018-107312-0006.flac,that rose in all directions clustering yet isolated announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of mowbray crossing this open ground they gained a suburb but one of a very different description
1394,4018-107312-0032.flac,and we shall be happy to see you mick and julia if you are not engaged continued the girl and she looked at her friend a pretty demure girl who immediately said but in a somewhat faltering tone oh that we shall
1395,4018-107312-0007.flac,to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with sybil this one was populous noisy and lighted it was saturday night the streets were thronged an infinite population kept swarming to and fro
1396,4018-107312-0004.flac,would be the future eyesore of a flourishing posterity pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile gerard and stephen turned down a street which intersected it
1397,4018-107312-0030.flac,we have got fifty members and take in three london papers one northern star and two moral worlds and where are you now child continued the widow to the girl

1405,4018-107312-0005.flac,and so on through a variety of ways and winding lanes till they arrived at an open portion of the town a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack looking buildings
1406,4018-107312-0035.flac,i'll stand treat and take you and your friend to the temple well that's delight said caroline there's no one does the handsome thing like you dandy mick and i always say so oh i love the temple tis so genteel
1407,4018-107312-0029.flac,but young persons yes said mick i don't think i could get through the day if it werno for our institute and what's that asked missus carey with a sneer the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure said mick
1408,4018-107312-0000.flac,the chief street of mowbray called castle street after the ruins of the old boronial stronghold in its neighborhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence
1409,4018-107312-0008.flac,by narrow archways like the entrance of hives so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission while ascending to these same streets from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps
1410,4018-107312-0018.flac,he was about sixteen with a lithe figure and a handsome faded impudent face his long loose white trousers gave him height he had no waistcoat but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck
1411,4018-107312-0015.flac,i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines soul alive but those shuffle in screw are rotten snicky bad yarns said mistress carey
1412,4018-107312-0031.flac,if you will take a dish of tea with us to morrow we expect some friends i take it kindly said missus carey and so you keep house together all the children keep house in these days times is changed indeed
1413,7067-76047-0026.flac,it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honoured amused
1414,7067-76047-0006.flac,on the second occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling
1415,7067-76047-0039.flac,i see a lot more than that you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible negligible that is the exact word to them you can't look at a woman for five minutes
1416,7067-76047-0030.flac,probably bored her more than she realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewelry
1417,7067-76047-0011.flac,am i said doctor martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party
1418,7067-76047-0024.flac,her manner with miss seyffert an excellent manner for miss seyffert by the bye isn't the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day or for one person only she is a very sure and commanding young woman sir richmond nodded
1419,7067-76047-0031.flac,and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was twenty i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presents those who seek find
1420,7067-76047-0018.flac,this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves as if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more
1421,7067-76047-0010.flac,i'm twice her age we are a party of four there are conventions there are considerations aren't you really my dear martineau overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests
1422,7067-76047-0021.flac,miss seyffert is a fairly crude mixture of frankness in sincerity and self explanatory egotism and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me
1423,7067-76047-0049.flac,they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martineau
1424,7067-76047-0009.flac,she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable self control and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say
1425,7067-76047-0014.flac,i shall be sorry all the same i could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened a little later the matter was settled nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said
1426,7067-76047-0022.flac,now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond you know that she has told me as much
1427,7067-76047-0032.flac,what do you think she found what would a rich girl find out there in america i don't know i haven't the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction
1428,7067-76047-0008.flac,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeed and almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady o very good social position indeed
1429,7067-76047-0036.flac,or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didn't expect it she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth she has ceased to take the world for granted it hasn't broken her but it has matured her
1430,7067-76047-0029.flac,she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss grammont is not silly
1431,7067-76047-0020.flac,and in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favored with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile
1432,7067-76047-0005.flac,sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice to day miss seyfferd has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was
1433,7067-76047-0016.flac,and honor than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility
1434,7067-76047-0037.flac,that i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you in her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on
1435,7067-76047-0015.flac,but neither gentlemen wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the the inconveniences your present code would set about it
1436,7067-76047-0045.flac,really he said this is preposterous you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf in our ages in our quality
1437,7067-76047-0040.flac,seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity miss grammont has an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoilt child with no discipline
1438,7067-76047-0028.flac,i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them
1439,7067-76047-0038.flac,she sees history as you see it and i see it she is a very grown up young woman it's just that said sir richmond it's just that if you see as much in miss grammont as all that why don't you want to come on with us you see the interest of her
1440,7067-76047-0012.flac,there were some moments of silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said doctor martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity
1441,7067-76047-0043.flac,grotesquely happen he said she knows nothing of martin leeds you must remember that and then he added if she and you fall in love
1442,7067-76047-0048.flac,and at present the world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the core of this situation a pause fell between the two gentlemen
1443,7067-76047-0046.flac,from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing are men and women to go on for ever separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds
1444,7067-76047-0041.flac,you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends you on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leads
1445,7067-76047-0025.flac,i suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butcher the thing has been done these business americans i am told neglect their womenkind give them money and power let them loose on the world
1446,7067-76047-0027.flac,talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time i think this must be near the truth of her biography said sir richmond
1447,7067-76047-0044.flac,as the phrase goes what is to follow there was a pause sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offence
1448,7067-76047-0035.flac,and something more than that what it is i don't know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed
1449,7067-76047-0023.flac,well she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions that is how i inferred that there was no mother i don't think there has been any stepmother
1450,7067-76047-0013.flac,i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kennem latter at bornmouth nothing simpler than to go to him now
1451,7067-76047-0017.flac,but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one and you if you will forgive me are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications
1452,7067-76047-0042.flac,you i say are also at loose ends can you deny it my dear sir don't we both know that ever since we left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three hapoth of kindness
1453,7067-76047-0007.flac,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair
1454,7067-76047-0033.flac,she would find that life was worth while to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her sex she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worth while for him
1455,7067-76047-0019.flac,may involve very serious consequences indeed with which i for one do not wish to be involved sir richmond upon the hearthrug had a curious feeling that he was back in the head master's study at caxton
1456,7067-76047-0047.flac,is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you too anyhow
1457,7067-76047-0034.flac,harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance there have been love experiences experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there
1458,7067-76047-0002.flac,and bit his lower lip and considered we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite
1459,7067-76047-0001.flac,abroad and original thinker as you are thought is one matter rash inconsiderate action quite another and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of miss
1460,7067-76047-0004.flac,for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum i object to miss grammont and that side of the thing more than i do to miss seyffert
1461,7067-76047-0003.flac,she could for example be left behind with the luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammont there was no immediate reply
1462,7067-76047-0000.flac,after twenty four eventful hours our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension
1463,7067-76048-0045.flac,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all
1464,7067-76048-0044.flac,at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mister grammont's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost
1465,7067-76048-0020.flac,i've been talking of this sort of thing with my friend doctor martineau and i've been thinking as well as talking that perhaps is why i'm so clear and positive i don't complain that you are clear and positive i've been coming along the same way
1466,7067-76048-0040.flac,she had no allusions about the power of the former class it didn't exist they were steered to their decisions by people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates the owners of america the real responsible citizens
1467,7067-76048-0000.flac,i leave you to it his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation ought you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond i shall be interested to learn what happens but if you won't stay to see
1468,7067-76048-0051.flac,and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way
1469,7067-76048-0039.flac,that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well
1470,7067-76048-0034.flac,sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martineau he recalled to the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin
1471,7067-76048-0043.flac,father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son
1472,7067-76048-0008.flac,to a happy use by clamering to the top of it and sliding on their little beehinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing
1473,7067-76048-0002.flac,section two for the better part of forty hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence
1474,7067-76048-0055.flac,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to doctor martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that doctor martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him
1475,7067-76048-0011.flac,nobody is doing anything with the world except muddle about why not give it a direction you'd take it in your hands like clay obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its own
1476,7067-76048-0003.flac,and she repeated no remembered comments and profits of her contemporaries about herself she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality
1477,7067-76048-0017.flac,we have been made an exception of and got our rations the big thing confronts us still
1478,7067-76048-0033.flac,she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life that isn't going on she said with an effect of conclusive decision
1479,7067-76048-0025.flac,making them matter as formerly they didn't seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before
1480,7067-76048-0001.flac,now sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and doctor martineau got in sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit what else could i do he asked aloud to nobody in particular
1481,7067-76048-0016.flac,who have imaginations want something more nowadays of course we want bright lives of course we want happiness just as we want food just as we want sleep but when we have eaten when we have slept when we have jolly things about us it is nothing
1482,7067-76048-0023.flac,the adolescence so to speak of mankind it is an idea that seizes the imagination there is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears
1483,7067-76048-0035.flac,he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments
1484,7067-76048-0036.flac,in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality martineau was very fine minded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter
1485,7067-76048-0041.flac,or they felt a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries but anyhow they were steered she herself it was clear was bound to become a very responsible citizen indeed
1486,7067-76048-0005.flac,she liked his turn of thought she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favored visitor
1487,7067-76048-0015.flac,sensible little piggy whiggies we have a right to life and happiness first said sir richmond as much right as a pig has to food but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings
1488,7067-76048-0024.flac,there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities we are sharing the adolescence of our race it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us
1489,7067-76048-0048.flac,she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two men servants
1490,7067-76048-0027.flac,but controlling father as distinguished from managing him she reviewed some private and amusing memories he is a most intractable man section three
1491,7067-76048-0031.flac,we don't get enough to do we're spenders and wasters not always from choice while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker
1492,7067-76048-0021.flac,it's refreshing to meet you i found it refreshing to meet martineau a twinge of conscience about doctor martineau turned sir richmond into a new channel he's a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects
1493,7067-76048-0029.flac,gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives
1494,7067-76048-0058.flac,what are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically ordered
1495,7067-76048-0042.flac,she would some day she laughed be swimming an oil and such like property her interest in sir richmond's schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was therefore she realized a very direct one but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that
1496,7067-76048-0006.flac,as a crisis in which they were called upon to do something they did not yet clearly know what into this topic they peered as into some deep pool side by side and in it they saw each other reflected
1497,7067-76048-0049.flac,this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of inquiry into mexico there apparently she had really done responsible work but upon the question of labor mister grammont was fierce
1498,7067-76048-0004.flac,but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences and her liking for sir richmond was pleasingly manifest
1499,7067-76048-0060.flac,and replaceable structures indeed both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before
1500,7067-76048-0046.flac,he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicability of his life's ideal there was hetty green this latter idea had left her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe
1501,7067-76048-0053.flac,still quite vaguely guessing so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as illusions or by way of illustration
1502,7067-76048-0054.flac,the sustaining topic was this new age sir richmond foreshadowed this world under scientific control the utopia of fully developed people fully developing the resources of the earth
1503,7067-76048-0056.flac,but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with doctor martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings
1504,7067-76048-0012.flac,her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice i believe what you say is possible if people dare i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them
1505,7067-76048-0059.flac,an immense organization of mature common sense healthy and secure gathering knowledge and power for creative adventurers as yet beyond dreaming
1506,7067-76048-0038.flac,her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond i realize i've got to be a responsible american citizen she had said
1507,7067-76048-0030.flac,you will find my father extremely difficult but some of our younger men would love it and she went on there are american women who'd love it too we're petted we're kept out of things we aren't placed
1508,7067-76048-0022.flac,devoted to his work and he's writing a book which has saturated him in these ideas only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it the psychology of a new age the world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its history
1509,7067-76048-0032.flac,with all the empty unspeakable solemnity of the mal and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings that can't go on she said her eyes went back to the long low undulating skyline of the downs
1510,7067-76048-0050.flac,he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas
1511,7067-76048-0014.flac,and pride ourselves upon our freedom from the sin of presumption not quite that well how do you put it we are afraid she said it's too vast we want bright little lives of our own
1512,7067-76048-0018.flac,i do not know why it should be so but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind i want it as my culminating want i want a world in order
1513,7067-76048-0026.flac,incidentally he smiled i want to get alasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbaric person your father i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world control of fuel production and distribution
1514,7067-76048-0052.flac,mister lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment there was some story however connected with her war services in europe upon which miss grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell
1515,7067-76048-0009.flac,sir richmond and miss grammont had walked round the old circumvalation together but belinda seyffert had strayed away from them professing an interest in flowers
1516,7067-76048-0019.flac,a disciplined mankind going on to greater things don't you now you tell me of it she said with a smile i do but before no you've made it clear it wasn't clear before
1517,7067-76048-0037.flac,but passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest than it wasn't so necessary it might happen
1518,7067-76048-0010.flac,that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards that new world of yours of two hundred and fifty million fully developed beautiful and happy people why not
1519,7067-76048-0028.flac,they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own
1520,7067-76048-0057.flac,and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise to morrow the new age will be here no doubt but to day it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings so that it was natural for miss grammont and sir richmond to ask

1765,1334-135589-0021.flac,made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
1766,1334-135589-0007.flac,can you procure any of your countrymen i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for any more
1767,1334-135589-0020.flac,and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands turenne bore down conde who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
1768,1334-135589-0013.flac,conde obtained the victory at blenan and in april sixteen fifty two advanced to paris turenne who had taken the command of the french army followed him
1769,1334-135589-0025.flac,on the fifteenth of may sixteen sixty the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king sailed from cheveling
1770,1334-135589-0062.flac,those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
1771,1334-135589-0033.flac,for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
1772,1334-135589-0042.flac,i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
1773,1334-135589-0049.flac,although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot
1774,1334-135589-0087.flac,and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
1775,1334-135589-0040.flac,now edward who do you think was here to day the reigning bell and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
1776,1334-135589-0095.flac,tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and edith wrong as regards his daughter
1777,1334-135589-0028.flac,and his attendant suit chaloner edward and grenville who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting were certainly the most distinguished among the king's retinue look edward
1778,1334-135589-0008.flac,bring me the officers to morrow at this hour monsieur beverley au revois
1779,1334-135589-0036.flac,alice and edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
1780,1334-135589-0065.flac,and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader
1781,1334-135589-0097.flac,on mister heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
1782,1334-135589-0054.flac,recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
1783,1334-135589-0032.flac,will they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
1784,1334-135589-0064.flac,even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward
1785,1334-135589-0009.flac,edward went to chaloner and grenville who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them the next day they were at the prince's levee and introduced by edward i am fortunate gentlemen
1786,1334-135589-0017.flac,he wrote a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
1787,1334-135589-0041.flac,no less than one with whom you were formally well acquainted edward patience heatherstone patience heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
1788,1334-135589-0022.flac,edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
1789,1334-135589-0071.flac,edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve
1790,1334-135589-0093.flac,that will be exclanation sufficient i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere
1791,1334-135589-0059.flac,what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us
1792,1334-135589-0105.flac,oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age
1793,1334-135589-0037.flac,the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
1794,1334-135589-0000.flac,chapter twenty seven but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army
1795,1334-135589-0060.flac,and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstone's intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward
1796,1334-135589-0099.flac,then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fete at hampton court given in honor of three marriages taking place edward beverley to patience heatherstone chaloner
1797,1334-135589-0039.flac,which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
1798,1334-135589-0005.flac,conde is just now released from vincene's but depend upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of conde
1799,1334-135589-0001.flac,you have to choose between two generals both great in the art of war
1800,1334-135589-0096.flac,nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed passed my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mister heatherstone edward
1801,1334-135589-0053.flac,which has been so long held by others
1802,1334-135589-0056.flac,at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
1803,1334-135589-0057.flac,why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
1804,1334-135589-0061.flac,and now let me give you some advice for your friends master chaloner and grenville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
1805,1334-135589-0024.flac,and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and everything was ready for the restoration
1806,1334-135589-0045.flac,how can you say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity
1807,1334-135589-0023.flac,after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
1808,1334-135589-0075.flac,and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
1809,1334-135589-0089.flac,to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argue upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
1810,1334-135589-0070.flac,mister heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
1811,1334-135589-0069.flac,and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
1812,1334-135589-0090.flac,replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
1813,1334-135589-0047.flac,and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
1814,1334-135589-0051.flac,is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property
1815,1334-135589-0048.flac,but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
1816,1334-135589-0015.flac,and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his departure from paris edward had received humphrey's letter explaining away the intendant's conduct
1817,1334-135589-0088.flac,you know humphrey how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
1818,1334-135589-0043.flac,with her to day when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
1819,1334-135589-0026.flac,was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london which he entered amid the acclamations of the people on the twenty ninth of the same month we may leave the reader to suppose that edward
1820,1334-135589-0092.flac,i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially
1821,1334-135589-0018.flac,except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects it may be years before i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
1822,1334-135589-0027.flac,were among the most favored of those in his train as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude the windows of all the houses were filled with well dressed ladies who waved their white kerchiefs to the king
1823,1334-135589-0063.flac,but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
1824,1334-135589-0011.flac,and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required a month after this interview conde who had been joined by a great number of nobles
1825,1334-135589-0094.flac,what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him your coming with me will make it appear so
1826,1334-135589-0076.flac,i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patience made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
1827,1334-135589-0104.flac,the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a houseful of young gipsies
1828,1334-135589-0034.flac,well chaloner to all appearance your good aunts have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
1829,1334-135589-0085.flac,it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
1830,1334-135589-0077.flac,and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was enabled to go to his sisters
1831,1334-135589-0038.flac,and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conningham and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
1832,1334-135589-0086.flac,and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
1833,1334-135589-0068.flac,on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
1834,1334-135589-0002.flac,and turen i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon that will be the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players which would your majesty recommend me to follow inquired edward
1835,1334-135589-0050.flac,you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you intwo said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you cannot blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone
1836,1334-135589-0098.flac,patience colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her
1837,1334-135589-0066.flac,that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had despatched a messenger with the letter
1838,1334-135589-0074.flac,and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance
1839,1334-135589-0072.flac,but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
1840,1334-135589-0029.flac,at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize them indeed i do not are they any of our parish beauties
1841,1334-135589-0052.flac,he cannot refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his counsel will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
1842,1334-135589-0081.flac,they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone
1843,1334-135589-0016.flac,and the contents removed a heavy load from edward's mind but he now thought of nothing but war and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
1844,1334-135589-0106.flac,in the capacity of housekeeper her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties
1845,1334-135589-0103.flac,claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey
1846,1334-135589-0035.flac,although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
1847,5678-43303-0036.flac,i am back all is well now listen can you hear yes yes the best has happened it is all over in the east felsenburgh has done it now listen i cannot come home to night it will be announced in paul's house in two hours from now
1848,5678-43303-0019.flac,she was not offended for she trusted her husband too well but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating the old lady too seemed excited she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks and hardly smiled at all to the girl's greeting
1849,5678-43303-0025.flac,as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would close that afternoon twenty o'clock came but there was no sign of oliver the paris volor should have arrived an hour before
1850,5678-43303-0018.flac,he seemed moved at something and mabel looked at him in astonishment it is not eastern news she asked his eyebrows wrinkled a little
1851,5678-43303-0008.flac,he made a little deprecating movement with his hands it is not certain that she will die it
1852,5678-43303-0027.flac,of course she might have missed it there was no depending on its exact course but she had seen it a hundred times before and wondered unreasonably why she had not seen it now but she would not sit down to dinner and paced up and down in her white dress
1853,5678-43303-0026.flac,but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one
1854,5678-43303-0003.flac,she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body the old lady was so tranquil and human
1855,5678-43303-0017.flac,he will will he not you have not heard mister brand said he would be here for a late dinner he will reach london at nineteen and is there any other news he compressed his lips there are rumors he said mister brand wired to me an hour ago
1856,5678-43303-0012.flac,so the girl went downstairs once more with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still what a strange and beautiful thing death was she told herself this resolution of a chord that had hung suspended for thirty fifty or seventy years
1857,5678-43303-0038.flac,yes quick mother is ill shall i leave her how ill oh no immediate danger the doctor has seen her there was silence for a moment yes come then we will go back to night anyhow then
1858,5678-43303-0023.flac,and he had given her no news of the paris convention he only repeated that mister oliver would be back that night then he had gone off in a hurry half an hour later the old lady seemed asleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her
1859,5678-43303-0024.flac,neither did she like to leave the house so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing till the long shadow lay across the path and the tumbled platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west
1860,5678-43303-0002.flac,and mabel running upstairs in alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair it is nothing my dear said the old lady tremulously and she added the description of a symptom or two
1861,5678-43303-0009.flac,she asked no no she may live ten years i said he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and went away the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand
1862,5678-43303-0000.flac,mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch and for a few days did her best but there was nothing that alarmed her the old lady was a little quiet perhaps but went about her minute affairs as usual she asked the girl to read to her sometimes
1863,5678-43303-0029.flac,and the heavenly darkness why did not oliver come or at least let her know why he did not once she went upstairs miserably anxious herself to reassure the old lady and found her again very drowsy he is not come she said
1864,5678-43303-0033.flac,she half decided to touch them one by one and inquire whether anything had been heard of her husband there was his club his office in whitehall mister phillip's house parliament house and the rest but she hesitated telling herself to be patient
1865,5678-43303-0030.flac,i daresay he may be kept in paris the old face on the pillow nodded and murmured and mabel went down again it was now an hour after dinner time oh there were a hundred things that might have kept him
1866,5678-43303-0006.flac,her whole point so to speak lay in the delicate little fabric of personality built out of fragile things into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion
1867,5678-43303-0034.flac,oliver hated interference and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety then even as she turned away the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight whitehall she pressed the corresponding button and her hand shaking so much
1868,5678-43303-0016.flac,where a heap of letters lay to be answered a couple of hours later as mabel went upstairs once more she met mister phillips coming down he looked a little flushed under his sallow skin missus brand sent for me he said she wished to know whether mister oliver would be back to night
1869,5678-43303-0031.flac,he had often been later than this he might have missed the volor he meant to catch the convention might have been prolonged he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire
1870,5678-43303-0011.flac,for there was no past to set straight no judge to be confronted death was an ending not a beginning it was a peaceful gospel at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come
1871,5678-43303-0005.flac,she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul for in that case she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things
1872,5678-43303-0021.flac,he will be back to dinner will he not if the volor is not late no mother are you ready for breakfast mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation it was certain that something had happened
1873,5678-43303-0015.flac,mister phillips arrived the next morning as usual just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her she is a little better i think said mabel she must be very quiet all day the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room
1874,5678-43303-0037.flac,we are communicating with the press come up here to meet me at once you must be present can you hear oh yes come then at once it will be the greatest thing in history tell no one come before the rush begins in half an hour the way will be stopped oliver
1875,5678-43303-0004.flac,so absorbed in small external matters so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth so utterly without resentment or peevishness
1876,5678-43303-0020.flac,said mabel old missus brand looked at her sharply an instant but said nothing don't excite yourself mother oliver will be back to night the old lady drew a long breath don't trouble about me my dear she said i shall do very well now
1877,5678-43303-0007.flac,the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace it is syncope said the doctor when he came in she may die at any time she may live ten years there is no need to telegraph for mister brand
1878,5678-43303-0022.flac,the secretary who breakfasted with her in the parlour looking on to the garden had appeared strangely excited he had told her that he would be away the rest of the day mister oliver had given him his instructions he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question
1879,5678-43303-0035.flac,that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear she listened who is there her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice tiny and minute across the miles of wire i mabel she said alone here
1880,5678-43303-0032.flac,he might even have wired to mister phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it there it was that round silent month that little row of labelled buttons
1881,5678-43303-0013.flac,back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself those same notes would be struck again were being struck again even now all over the world though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch
1882,5678-43303-0001.flac,she packed his bag with her own hands set out his furs for the swift flight to paris and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction he would be gone three days he said it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill
1883,5678-43303-0028.flac,turning again and again to the window listening to the soft rush of the trains the faint hoots from the track and the musical chords from the junction a mile away the lights were up by now and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairylad between the earthly light
1884,5678-43303-0010.flac,well my dear she asked it is just a little weakness mother you must lie quiet and do nothing shall i read to you no my dear i i will think a little it was no part of mabel's idea to duty to tell her that she was in danger
1885,5678-43303-0014.flac,but that particular emotion was gone it was foolish to think that it was sounding eternally elsewhere for there was no elsewhere she too herself would cease one day let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely
1886,5678-43301-0000.flac,in his masonic insignia it was he who had given immense impetus to that secret movement by his declaration in the house that the key of future progress and brotherhood of nations was in the hands of the order
1887,5678-43301-0016.flac,the kingdom of god it was said lay within the human heart and the greatest of all graces was charity she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure a hundred yards away
1888,5678-43301-0019.flac,of this great anniversary then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present fifty years ago the speaker said poverty was still a disgrace now it was so no longer
1889,5678-43301-0002.flac,and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ thus he had preluded his speech on the poor law question pointing to the true charity that existed among masons apart from religious motive
1890,5678-43301-0017.flac,and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or two across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him then he stepped back and oliver came forward it was too far for the two to hear what was said but mabel slipped a paper smiling tremulously
1891,5678-43301-0006.flac,and converged toward the wide railed space about the platform where room was reserved for them the windows on every side were packed with faces tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and saint martin's church
1892,5678-43301-0021.flac,he enumerated the reforms past fifty years before on this very day by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty
1893,5678-43301-0014.flac,and all england was familiar with it old missus brand lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes and saw the words that she knew so well the lord that dwells in earth and sea
1894,5678-43301-0018.flac,into the old lady's hand and herself bent forward to listen old missus brand looked at that too knowing that it was an analysis of her son's speech and aware that she would not be able to hear his words
1895,5678-43301-0008.flac,the old column was gone with its lions
1896,5678-43301-0009.flac,nor the lions to the new art and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery overhead the roofs showed crowded friezes of heads against the blue summer sky
1897,5678-43301-0007.flac,garden beds of color behind the mute white statues that faced outwards round the square from braithwait in front past the victorians john davidson john burns and the rest round to hampton and de montfort toward the north
1898,5678-43301-0001.flac,it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted saint paul had been right he declared in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations
1899,5678-43301-0010.flac,not less than one hundred thousand persons it was estimated in the evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon as the clocks began to tell the hour two figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward and in an instant
1900,5678-43301-0012.flac,and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion behind him came oliver bareheaded and spruce and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement
1901,5678-43301-0004.flac,and this platform was hung with roses surmounted by a sounding board and set with a chair and table the whole square roundabout was paved with heads and resonant with sound the murmurs of thousands of voices
1902,5678-43301-0026.flac,and a storm of laughter rippled around the throng of heads she heard an indrawn hiss behind her chair and the next instant an exclamation from mabel what was that there was a sharp crack and the tiny gesticulating figure staggered back a step
1903,5678-43301-0013.flac,there was no doubt that these londoners could sing it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody rising to enthusiasm till the music of massed bands followed it as a flag follows a flagstick the hymn was one composed ten years before
1904,5678-43301-0005.flac,overpowered now and again by the crash of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds each headed by a banner
1905,5678-43301-0020.flac,it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay who would not honour a man worn out in the service of his country or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail
1906,5678-43301-0015.flac,had been composed with both skill and ardor they had a religious ring the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm yet their sense was plain enough the old human creed that man was all even christ's words themselves were quoted
1907,5678-43301-0024.flac,a couple of women with an old man directly behind and other faces visible again behind them their obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction and she turned resolutely once more to the square ah he was working up now to his panegyric
1908,5678-43301-0025.flac,the tiny dark figure was back a yard nearer the statue and as she looked his hand went up and he wheeled pointing as a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice then again he was forward half crouching for he was a born actor
1909,5678-43301-0003.flac,and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesman appeared to be one of the speakers though at a slightly higher elevation
1910,5678-43301-0022.flac,and its reward and that he supposed together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws would form the first half of his speech the second part was to be a panegyric of braithwait treating him as the precursor of a movement that even now had begun
1911,5678-43301-0027.flac,the old man at the table was up in a moment and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were massed and directly opposite the front of the platform
1912,5678-43301-0011.flac,the murmurs of talk rose into cheering old lord pemberton came first a grey haired upright man whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over seventy years ago and his son had succeeded him worthily
1913,5678-43301-0023.flac,old missus brand leaned back in her seat and looked about her the window where they sat had been reserved for them two armchairs filled the space but immediately behind there were others standing very silent now craning forward watching two with parted lips
1914,5678-43302-0029.flac,tobolsk benares yakutsk everywhere and he's been to australia mabel sat up briskly isn't that very hopeful i suppose so there's no doubt that the sufies are winning but for how long is another question
1915,5678-43302-0025.flac,oliver stirred presently did you notice anything just now sweetheart when i said that about jesus christ she stopped knitting for a moment said the girl he nodded you saw that too then
1916,5678-43302-0011.flac,speaking in defence of his principles it was an incalculable gain for them and loss for the individualists that confessors were not all on one side after all
1917,5678-43302-0018.flac,my dear i feel very downcast sometimes as you know well i do not think i shall be again i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit and that the old tories were partly right when they prophesied what communism would do
1918,5678-43302-0007.flac,but he must have meant to do it anyhow continued oliver how do they know he was a catholic asked the girl again there was a rosary on him and then he just had time to call on his god and nothing more is known
1919,5678-43302-0010.flac,caldecott the prime minister maxwell snowford and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations and from every part of england streamed in message after message it was an immense stroke for the communists
1920,5678-43302-0040.flac,it was on too large a scale occasionally people went mad people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness but that was all
1921,5678-43302-0003.flac,but well i dare say it was more merciful but you did what you could my dear said the old lady anxiously from the corner i called out to them mother but they wouldn't hear me
1922,5678-43302-0030.flac,besides the troops don't disperse and europe europe is arming as fast as possible i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris i must go your arm my dear my arm must get well it will have to go with me anyhow
1923,5678-43302-0033.flac,these new benninschein explosives will make certain of that but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them absolutely benninschein sold them simultaneously to east and west then he died luckily for him mabel had heard this kind of talk before
1924,5678-43302-0039.flac,european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual men still built houses married wives begat sons and daughters did their business and went to the theatre for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else they could neither save nor precipitate the situation
1925,5678-43302-0024.flac,but she could see what she loved to see that response to her own heart and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more and the click of the riter in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs
1926,5678-43302-0021.flac,if only this infernal eastern affair would end he knew he was feverish and irritable and made a great effort to drive it down oh my dear he went on flushed a little
1927,5678-43302-0015.flac,there was some passion and loyalty left in england his mother got up presently and went out still without a word and mabel turned to him laying a hand on his knee are you too tired to talk my dear he opened his eyes
1928,5678-43302-0012.flac,the huge electric placards over london had winked out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight oliver brand wounded catholic assailant indignation of the country
1929,5678-43302-0035.flac,now if tales were true entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell the new conditions were unimaginable military experts prophecied extravagantly contradicting one another on vital points
1930,5678-43302-0019.flac,but after this well well we have shown that we can shed our blood too it is in the nick of time too just at the crisis i don't want to exaggerate it is only a scratch but it was so deliberate and
1931,5678-43302-0014.flac,he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and torn at his throat then the face had vanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared oh
1932,5678-43302-0036.flac,the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory there were no precedents with which to compare it it was as if archers disputed as to the results of kordyte only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine and as regards male population
1933,5678-43302-0022.flac,if they would not be such heavy fools they don't understand they don't understand yes oliver they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is humanity life truth at last and the death of folly but haven't i told them a hundred times
1934,5678-43302-0031.flac,tell me some more there is no more but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis if the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now it will never be likely to raise it again it will mean free trade all over the world i suppose
1935,5678-43302-0038.flac,founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world felsensburg's name appeared more frequently than ever otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush nothing suffered very much trade went on
1936,5678-43302-0016.flac,of course not my darling what is it what do you think will be the effect he raised himself a little looking out as usual through the darkening windows on to that astonishing view
1937,5678-43302-0008.flac,nothing more he was well dressed though oliver leaned back a little wearily and closed his eyes his arm still throbbed intolerably but he was very happy at heart it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic
1938,5678-43302-0034.flac,but her imagination simply refused to grasp it a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing there had been no european war within living memory and the eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions
1939,5678-43302-0020.flac,and so dramatic the poor devil could not have chosen a worse moment people won't forget it mabel's eyes shone with pleasure you poor dear she said are you in pain not much besides christ
1940,5678-43302-0001.flac,but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors he was a catholic explained the drawn faced oliver he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded
1941,5678-43302-0005.flac,she said then she broke off and sat back why did he shoot just then she asked oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother but she was knitting tranquilly then he answered with a curious deliberateness
1942,5678-43302-0037.flac,half as much again as the rest of the world put together and the conclusion to be drawn from these premises was not reassuring to england but imagination simply refused to speak the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day
1943,5678-43302-0028.flac,she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years well watch her won't you by the way yes there's a little more news from the east they say felsenburgh's running the whole thing now the empire is sending him everywhere
1944,5678-43302-0027.flac,no my dear you're excited and tired it's just a little sentiment oliver i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her but she hears it everywhere now no she doesn't remember
1945,5678-43302-0026.flac,mabel do you think she is falling back oh she is getting old said the girl lightly of course she looks back a little but you don't think it would be too awful she shook her head no
1946,5678-43302-0004.flac,mabel leaned forward oliver i know this sound stupid of me but but i wish they had not killed him oliver smiled at her he knew this tender trait in her it would have been more perfect if they had not
1947,5678-43302-0023.flac,she loved to see him like this his confident flushed face the enthusiasm in his blue eyes and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with passion she bent forward and kissed him suddenly my dear i am so proud of you oh oliver he said nothing
1948,5678-43302-0032.flac,and all that kind of thing but if not well if not there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined
1949,5678-43302-0006.flac,i said that braithwait had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second then they went on again as before
1950,5678-43302-0000.flac,oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home leaning back in his chair with one arm bandaged and in a sling they had not been able to get near him at the time the excitement in the square had been too fierce
1951,5678-43302-0002.flac,well there was no chance for a priest this time mabel nodded slowly she had read of the man's fate on the placards he was killed trampled and strangled instantly said oliver i did what i could you saw me
1952,5678-43302-0013.flac,well deserved fate of assassin he was pleased too that he honestly had done his best to save the man even in that moment of sudden and acute pain he had cried out for a fair trial but he had been too late
1953,5678-43302-0009.flac,but he was not sorry to bear pain in such a cause and it was obvious that the sympathy of england was with him mister phillips even now was busy in the next room answering the telegrams that poured in every moment
1954,5678-43302-0017.flac,everywhere now lights were glowing a sea of mellow moons just above the houses and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening the effect he said it can be nothing but good it was time that something happened
1955,8975-270782-0044.flac,subsequently every opportunity is made use of to disparage the new arrival and even attempts to do him bodily harm direct attacks are not unheard of
1956,8975-270782-0092.flac,others maintain that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the persons under consideration in both cases furthermore the incest avoidance would be automatically assured
1957,8975-270782-0059.flac,because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny their significance in life and to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing much oftener than it really is fulfilled but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth
1958,8975-270782-0003.flac,but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken the antiquity into which the dream work carries us back is of a double aspect firstly the individual antiquity childhood and secondly in so far as every individual in his childhood
1959,8975-270782-0097.flac,since the dream regresses to this stage it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us but it is only a deceptive appearance by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams
1960,8975-270782-0028.flac,this wish was no stranger to him while the child was still a suckling this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom
1961,8975-270782-0103.flac,which however disclose only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dream work is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression
1962,8975-270782-0089.flac,when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field
1963,8975-270782-0071.flac,and this love is substituted for the outworn love one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the oedipus complex on the contrary it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults
1964,8975-270782-0037.flac,we have wandered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature and certainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past
1965,8975-270782-0002.flac,so we call the mode of expression of the dream work the archaic or regressive you may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dream work we gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our intellectual development i trust this will be true
1966,8975-270782-0022.flac,in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asks the question whence such a wish comes
1967,8975-270782-0024.flac,the woman whose dream is interpreted to mean that she would like to see her seventeen year old daughter dead discovers under our guidance that she in fact at one time entertained this wish
1968,8975-270782-0041.flac,for his brothers and sisters with that which he has for his parents
1969,8975-270782-0082.flac,under the pressure of education he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes rather accredits to both the same genital formation
1970,8975-270782-0085.flac,and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child
1971,8975-270782-0107.flac,how does one solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that shares its characteristics
1972,8975-270782-0007.flac,that of a gap in the memory is far more frequent i believe we have not laid enough stress on this fact the child is able to speak well at the age of two it soon shows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic situations
1973,8975-270782-0087.flac,of perverse sexual activity to be sure the grown ups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances as play for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of custom or before the law
1974,8975-270782-0073.flac,cast out of life was yielded up to poetry and given the freest play o rank has shown in a careful study how this very oedipus complex has supplied dramatic literature
1975,8975-270782-0069.flac,but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child and one tends rather to underestimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments which may follow from it in addition
1976,8975-270782-0015.flac,and in so far as the cure is to any degree successful we are able again to bring to light the content of the childhood years thus clouded in forgetfulness these impressions have never really been forgotten they have only been inaccessible latent
1977,8975-270782-0050.flac,and rivalry among them but how may feelings of hatred force their way into the relationship between daughter and mother parents and children this relationship is without doubt the more favorable even when looked at from the viewpoint of the child
1978,8975-270782-0052.flac,which in the other case we permitted to remain profane
1979,8975-270782-0062.flac,as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example three it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses
1980,8975-270782-0057.flac,to the enjoyment thereof impatient waiting for the death of the father grows to heights approximating tragedy in the case of a successor to the throne less strained is the relationship between father and daughter mother and son
1981,8975-270782-0061.flac,it is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people the dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents especially the parent of the same sex we may conclude that it is also present during waking hours
1982,8975-270782-0040.flac,not until later does the love impulse become independent of egoism in brief egoism has taught the child to love in this connection it is instructive to compare the child's regard
1983,8975-270782-0026.flac,she beat her body with her fists in a fit of anger in order to kill the child how many mothers who to day love their children tenderly perhaps too tenderly received them unwillingly and at the time wished that the life within them would not develop further
1984,8975-270782-0027.flac,indeed translated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some loved one which seems so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person
1985,8975-270782-0064.flac,h sax but we also find this dream wish in places where it has no connection with life and where the adult in his waking hours would never recognize it the reason for this is that the deepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly
1986,8975-270782-0035.flac,which most frequently can be traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer
1987,8975-270782-0042.flac,often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling or rather let us say glossedover but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier it is most notable in children of from two and one half
1988,8975-270782-0111.flac,which shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we may to be sure propound the question what forces the psychological activity during sleep to such regression
1989,8975-270782-0079.flac,what we call perverse in the life of an adult differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the gulf between man and animal second
1990,8975-270782-0108.flac,the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication
1991,8975-270782-0063.flac,by which it is suppressed and must wait until a dream isolates it that which the dream shows us in enlarged form as a result of such isolation shrinks together again after it has been properly doceted in its relation to life as a result of our interpretation
1992,8975-270782-0055.flac,the abstention from sexual liberty which society demands in certain cases also she is the rival who objects to being displaced the same type of thing occurs in a more glaring manner between father and son
1993,8975-270782-0113.flac,what is the use of giving new life to old long outgrown psychic stimuli wishes and character types that is why the material regression in addition to the formal the only satisfactory answer would be this
1994,8975-270782-0095.flac,with all its peculiarities its egoism its incestuous love choice et cetera continues for the purposes of the dream in the unconscious
1995,8975-270782-0049.flac,if there is any one who hates a young english lady more than does her mother it is her elder sister there is something about this saying however that arouses our antipathy we can at a pinch understand hatred of brothers and sisters
1996,8975-270782-0093.flac,and most customary choice and that not until later is there any resistance the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology
1997,8975-270782-0096.flac,infantile side of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions partly because it is lightly considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child
1998,8975-270782-0014.flac,by means of careful analysis one is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten
1999,8975-270782-0109.flac,between these two parts the dream work completes itself the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious necessitates regression this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream
2000,8975-270782-0034.flac,that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past let us continue with the removal or death wish
2001,8975-270782-0066.flac,who is a disturbing element in her tender relationship with her father and who occupies a position that she could very well fill herself one learns from these observations to what early years these ideas extend back
2002,8975-270782-0047.flac,we need seldom find it puzzling and may trace its origin easily to early childhood often enough also to the propinquity of later years probably no nurseries are free from mighty conflicts among the inhabitants
2003,8975-270782-0114.flac,that only in this manner can a dream be built up
2004,8975-270782-0038.flac,or real remnants thereof show themselves for the child loves itself first and later learns to love others to sacrifice something of its ego for another
2005,8975-270782-0053.flac,the feelings between parents and their grown children fail to come up to the ideal established by society how much enmity exists and would find expression did not accumulations of piety and of tender impulse hold them back the motives for this are everywhere known
2006,8975-270782-0043.flac,to four or five years of age when a new little brother or sister arrives the latter is usually received in a far from friendly manner expression such as i don't want him let the stork take him away again are very usual
2007,8975-270782-0017.flac,beautiful examples of this occur in literature and i myself can present such an example i once dreamed in a certain connection of a person who must have performed some service for me and whom i clearly saw he was a one eyed man short in stature stout
2008,8975-270782-0070.flac,children frequently react to the oedipus idea through stimulation by the parents who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences so that the father prefers the daughter the mother the son
2009,8975-270782-0081.flac,he knows no unbridgeable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he is not disgusted at the sight of excrement but slowly learns to be so disgusted
2010,8975-270782-0058.flac,the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistical considerations why do i speak of these things so benal and so well known
2011,8975-270782-0008.flac,and makes remarks which years later are retold to it but which it has itself entirely forgotten besides the memory in the early years is more facile because it is less burdened than in later years
2012,8975-270782-0098.flac,if the evil impulses of the dream are merely enfantilism a return to the beginnings of our ethical development since the dream simply makes children of us again in thinking and in feeling we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable
2013,8975-270782-0030.flac,only wish to warn you that you are to take into consideration not the exact terms of the dream but the meaning thereof according to its interpretation it may happen that the manifest dream of the death of some loved person has only made use of some frightful mask
2014,8975-270782-0075.flac,who were so fortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents and intimately associated therewith we find what we call the cestratian complex the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father
2015,8975-270782-0078.flac,that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects
2016,8975-270782-0031.flac,that it really means something entirely different or that the loved person serves as a concealing substitute for some other but the same circumstance will call forth another more difficult question you say granted this death wish was present at some time or other
2017,8975-270782-0102.flac,and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts
2018,8975-270782-0045.flac,if the difference in age is less the child learns of the existence of the rival with intense psychic activity and accommodates himself to the new situation if the difference in age is greater the new child may awaken certain sympathies as an
2019,8975-270782-0068.flac,i do not wish to maintain that the oedipus complex covers entirely the relation of the child to its parents this relation can be much more complicated furthermore the oedipus complex is more or less well developed it may even experience a reversal
2020,8975-270782-0100.flac,are ashamed and angry if one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form
2021,8975-270782-0046.flac,interesting object as a sort of living doll and if the difference is eight years or more motherly impulses especially in the case of girls may come into play but to be truthful when we disclose in a dream the wish for the death of a mother or sister
2022,8975-270782-0054.flac,and disclose a tendency to separate those of the same sex daughter from mother father from son the daughter finds in her mother the authority that hems in her will and that is entrusted with the task of causing her to carry out
2023,8975-270782-0010.flac,i must point out that certain well preserved memories for the most part formatively experienced stand forth in this memory void which surrounds the first years of childhood and do not justify this hypothesis
2024,8975-270782-0104.flac,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even our old intellectual property
2025,8975-270782-0033.flac,in one of the most important points of dream study but i must remain within the bounds of our discussion and practice restraint prepare yourselves for the temporary abstention let us be satisfied with the circumstantial proof
2026,8975-270782-0056.flac,to the son the father is the embodiment of every social restriction born with such great opposition the father bars the way to freedom of will to early sexual satisfaction
2027,8975-270782-0032.flac,and is substantiated by memory yet this is no explanation it is long outlived today it can be present only in the unconscious and as an empty emotionless memory but not as a strong impulse why should it be recalled by the dream at all this question is justified
2028,8975-270782-0012.flac,they do not bespeak necessarily important experiences of childhood not even such as from the viewpoint of the child need appear of importance they are often so banal and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves in wonder why just these details
2029,8975-270782-0067.flac,ideas which we designate as the oedipus complex because this myth realizes with a very slightly weakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the son to kill his father and take his mother to wife
2030,8975-270782-0025.flac,which early ended in a separation
2031,8975-270782-0013.flac,have escaped being forgotten i once endeavored to approach the riddle of childhood emnesia and the interrupted memory remnants with the help of analysis and i arrived at the conclusion that in the case of the child too
2032,8975-270782-0094.flac,toward the understanding of the dream we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream
2033,8975-270782-0080.flac,being insensible to the conventional feeling of disgust third the incest limitation being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction with near blood relations fourth homosexuality and fifth
2034,8975-270782-0039.flac,even those persons whom the child seems to love from the very beginning it loves at the outset because it has need of them cannot do without them in other words out of egoistical motives
2035,8975-270782-0011.flac,our memory deals selectively with its later materials with impressions which come to us in later life it retains the important and discards the unimportant this is not true of the retained childhood memories
2036,8975-270782-0051.flac,this is in accord with our expectation we find it much more offensive for love between parents and children to be lacking than for love between brothers and sisters we have so to speak made something holly in the first instance
2037,8975-270782-0072.flac,and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this proscribed or tabooed feeling relationship later made good the omission by taking all value from the complex through false interpretations according to my unchanged conviction
2038,8975-270782-0083.flac,toward those persons closest to him and who are dear to him for various reasons his parents brothers and sisters nurses and finally you may observe in him that which later breaks through again raise now to a love attraction
2039,8975-270782-0090.flac,those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what antipathy society feels towards such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it
2040,8975-270782-0023.flac,we need not hesitate to point out this origin these evil wish impulses have their origin in the past often in a past which is not too far away
2041,8975-270782-0065.flac,especially between persons of the same sex has already made its influence felt in earliest childhood i mean the love rivalry with the especial emphasis of the sex character the son even as a small child
2042,8975-270782-0106.flac,but the latent dream thoughts which we have solved by means of the dream interpretation are not of this realm they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours still they are unconscious
2043,8975-270782-0084.flac,polymorphus perverse and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses it is on the one hand because of their lesser intensity as compared to later life and on the other hand
2044,8975-270782-0001.flac,transforms the latent dream thoughts into some other form of expression the latent thoughts are no other than the conscious thoughts known to us in our waking hours the new mode of expression is incomprehensible to us because of its many sided features
2045,8975-270782-0029.flac,that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur
2046,8975-270782-0112.flac,why do not the sleep disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it and if they must because of the dream censorship disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible
2047,8975-270782-0019.flac,and i learned from her that he had one eye was short and stout with his head sunk into his neck and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me this control over the forgotten material of childhood years
2048,8975-270782-0088.flac,but these things do exist they have their significance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and furtherances of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man
2049,8975-270782-0018.flac,his head deeply sunk into his neck i concluded from the content that he was a physician luckily i was able to ask my mother who was still living how the physician in my birthplace which i left when i was three years old looked
2050,8975-270782-0060.flac,rather than that this task should be left to the cynic in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal
2051,8975-270782-0004.flac,that we shall be able to differentiate which part of the latent psychic proceedings has its source in the individual
2052,8975-270782-0074.flac,with a large number of motives in unending variations derivations and disguises also in distorted forms such as we recognize to be the work of a censor we may also ascribe this oedipus complex to those dreamers
2053,8975-270782-0021.flac,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he
2054,1502-122619-0080.flac,of various deeds in arms done in former ages his bosom was loaded with metals some in massive silver and one or two even in gold
2055,1502-122619-0064.flac,he anticipated every measure on which they decided and it might almost be said
2056,1502-122619-0087.flac,whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes
2057,1502-122619-0027.flac,the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand and remained silent then magua as if recalled to such a recollection by the allusion to the massacre demanded
2058,1502-122619-0003.flac,in various ways it was a prevalent opinion however
2059,1502-122619-0057.flac,the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated the women suspended their labors to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors
2060,1502-122619-0017.flac,one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines the wise huron is welcome said the delaware
2061,1502-122619-0056.flac,a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in
2062,1502-122619-0030.flac,in this his opening effort to regain possession of cora do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their hunts he at length continued
2063,1502-122619-0067.flac,in front of the encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect it might have been half an hour before each individual including even the women and children was in his place
2064,1502-122619-0060.flac,the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform under circumstances of so much delicacy an embarrassment
2065,1502-122619-0032.flac,good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time
2066,1502-122619-0071.flac,until such a one chose to make some movement no deeds in arms no natural gifts nor any renown as an orator
2067,1502-122619-0062.flac,and apparently as unconcerned as if he had no interest in the result
2068,1502-122619-0094.flac,the chiefs drew back again to their several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment
2069,1502-122619-0049.flac,together with the material part of their physical force were actually within the limits of the french territory accordingly this alarming anunciation was received as magua intended
2070,1502-122619-0045.flac,then they fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends their minds are turned from their canada father this insinuation was a home thrust
2071,1502-122619-0014.flac,fortified by these assurances the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace
2072,1502-122619-0001.flac,could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks
2073,1502-122619-0033.flac,to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares before he added have there not been strange moccasins in the woods have not my brothers scented the feet of white men
2074,1502-122619-0038.flac,in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors one of whom was his host he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors
2075,1502-122619-0020.flac,then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge and share his morning meal the invitation was accepted and the two warriors attended by three or four of the old men walked calmly away
2076,1502-122619-0075.flac,had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain his frame which had once been tall and erect like the cedar was now bending under the pressure of more than a century
2077,1502-122619-0070.flac,standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious discussion
2078,1502-122619-0052.flac,will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the camp of his children
2079,1502-122619-0015.flac,he made as he advanced many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice the women however like one who deemed their favor in the present enterprise of no importance
2080,1502-122619-0090.flac,with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father
2081,1502-122619-0085.flac,with the great spirit and which has since transmitted his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his ancient territory
2082,1502-122619-0009.flac,the instruments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges but none departed here and there a warrior was examining his arms with an attention that is rarely bestowed on the implements
2083,1502-122619-0044.flac,would the yengees send their women a spies did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle he told no lie the yengeese have sent out their scouts
2084,1502-122619-0091.flac,who belongs rather to another world than to this was received by his people after a suitable and decent pause
2085,1502-122619-0047.flac,and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee
2086,1502-122619-0051.flac,he will see no change it is true my young men did not go out on the war path they had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white chief
2087,1502-122619-0066.flac,now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue
2088,1502-122619-0010.flac,when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously
2089,1502-122619-0005.flac,that their hatchets were dull and time was necessary to sharpen them the politic captain of the canadaes had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy
2090,1502-122619-0016.flac,his reception was grave silent and wary the warriors in front stepped aside opening the way to their most approved orator by the action
2091,1502-122619-0059.flac,in short every occupation was abandoned for the time and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge after their own peculiar manner in an open expression of feeling
2092,1502-122619-0008.flac,a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends the warriors were lounging in groups
2093,1502-122619-0012.flac,he was without arms and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance when in full view of the delawares he stopped and made a gesture of enmity
2094,1502-122619-0065.flac,and formal assemblage of the nation as such meetings were rare and only called on occasions of the last importance the subtle huron who still sat apart
2095,1502-122619-0041.flac,my brother is a wise chief he is welcome the hurons love their friends the delawares returned magua why should they not they are coloured by the same sun and their just men will hunt in the same grounds after death
2096,1502-122619-0063.flac,escaped his vigilant eyes
2097,1502-122619-0048.flac,that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements their distant villages their hunting grounds
2098,1502-122619-0089.flac,the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions
2099,1502-122619-0021.flac,leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short and frugal repast that followed
2100,1502-122619-0079.flac,was rich in imposing though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe his robe was of the finest skins which had been deprived of their fur
2101,1502-122619-0050.flac,with manifest disappropiation if not with alarm
2102,1502-122619-0068.flac,the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain
2103,1502-122619-0007.flac,the woman ran from lodge to lodge
2104,1502-122619-0046.flac,would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skilful diplomacist the recent defection of the tribe had as they well knew themselves subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies
2105,1502-122619-0074.flac,and three men issuing from it slowly approached the place of consultation they were all aged even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached but one in the centre who leaned on his companions for support
2106,1502-122619-0000.flac,brief i pray for you for you see tis a busy time with me much ado about nothing the tribe or rather half tribe of delawares
2107,1502-122619-0042.flac,the red skins should be friends and look with open eyes on the white men has not my brother scented spies in the woods the delaware whose name in english signified hard heart
2108,1502-122619-0092.flac,and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person
2109,1502-122619-0025.flac,when was it ever otherwise returned magua he calls my people most beloved the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued
2110,1502-122619-0081.flac,he also wore armlets and cinctures above the ankles of the latter precious metal
2111,1502-122619-0093.flac,so just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the great mass of the multitude deeming in a sufficient happiness
2112,1502-122619-0004.flac,that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity
2113,1502-122619-0082.flac,in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks his tomhawk was nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure
2114,1502-122619-0073.flac,that always preceded a conference but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally an eye was raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
2115,1502-122619-0095.flac,arose left the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning
2116,1502-122619-0054.flac,la longue carabine the delaware warriors started at the well known name betraying by their amazement that they now learned for the first time one so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power
2117,1502-122619-0069.flac,its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls
2118,1502-122619-0084.flac,was whispered from mouth to mouth magua had often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware
2119,1502-122619-0022.flac,and related entirely to the events of the hunt in which magua had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts
2120,1502-122619-0028.flac,does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open let her be sent to my squaws if she gives trouble to my brother
2121,1502-122619-0002.flac,though they had seen fit with ha mysterious reserve so common among the natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of the ally
2122,1502-122619-0076.flac,the elastic light step of an indian was gone and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground
2123,1502-122619-0019.flac,he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist then once more exchanged friendly salutations
2124,1502-122619-0077.flac,his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders
2125,1502-122619-0061.flac,magua had not only maintained his seat but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge
2126,1502-122619-0024.flac,is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children
2127,1502-122619-0055.flac,what does my brother mean demanded la courdeur in a tone that by its wonder far exceeded the usual apathy of his race a huron never lies returned magua coldly
2128,1502-122619-0031.flac,it is well justice is the master of a red skin why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers
2129,1502-122619-0011.flac,as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village
2130,1502-122619-0086.flac,the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out of a little from the throng
2131,1502-122619-0058.flac,the boys deserted their sports and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the termerity of their hated foe
2132,1502-122619-0096.flac,escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment the crowd opened in a lane and when the party had re entered
2133,1502-122619-0036.flac,it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said magua once more shifting his ground
2134,1502-122619-0040.flac,so aptly mingled with praise in the eyes of those he addressed this well judged and polite stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results
2135,1502-122619-0083.flac,which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided
2136,1502-122619-0088.flac,the americans sometimes call their tutelar saint temany a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced
2137,1502-122619-0037.flac,and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry
2138,1502-122619-0072.flac,on the present occasion the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak was silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause
2139,1502-122619-0039.flac,compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the doner immediately to read the effect of a generosity
2140,1502-122619-0034.flac,let my canada father come returned the other evasively his children are ready to see him when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams the hurons say too he is welcome
2141,1502-122619-0023.flac,notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware
2142,1502-122619-0029.flac,she is welcome returned the chief of the latter nation still more emphatically the baffled magua continued silent several minutes apparently indifferent however to the repulse he had received
2143,1502-122619-0018.flac,composed of cracked corn and beans it is much used also by the whites by corn is meant maize
2144,1502-122619-0013.flac,by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall impressively on his breast
2145,1502-122619-0006.flac,on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people
2146,1502-122619-0043.flac,an appellation that the french had translated into le curdur forgot that obduracy of purpose
2147,1502-122619-0078.flac,since they had last been shorn the dress of this patriarch for such considering his vast age in conjunction with his affinity and iffluence with his people he might very properly be termed
2148,1502-122619-0053.flac,that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delawares go my great canada father is not a fool
2149,1502-122619-0035.flac,but the yengeese have long arms and legs that never tire
2150,1502-122619-0026.flac,the tomahawks of your young men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yankeese are dead and the delawares are our neighbors
2151,1502-122615-0001.flac,the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior tremble the gray head and the sagamore are safe
2152,1502-122615-0038.flac,not so they who wear the petticoats of squaws on their own river one of them has been passing the tribe did my young men take his scalp
2153,1502-122615-0014.flac,i thank him and evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men can the cunning stranger frighten him away heyward possessed some knowledge and the mummery practiced among the indians
2154,1502-122615-0016.flac,that would have given him more satisfaction aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character however he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery spirits differ
2155,1502-122615-0015.flac,in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal
2156,1502-122615-0033.flac,the expression of his eye contradicted his figurative and boastful language
2157,1502-122615-0022.flac,drew his tomahawk from his girdle and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapours of the weed through the hollow handle
2158,1502-122615-0018.flac,equal to that maintained by the chief who was in truth a near relative of the afflicted woman the minutes lingered and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer an empiricism when the huron laid aside his pipe
2159,1502-122615-0025.flac,as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant the smoke wreathed above their heads a little eddies
2160,1502-122615-0008.flac,proved favorable to his views and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage without seeming to hesitate
2161,1502-122615-0003.flac,but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh
2162,1502-122615-0032.flac,he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself i have done the speaker who was the father of the creant young indian looked round and about him
2163,1502-122615-0021.flac,several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again
2164,1502-122615-0019.flac,and drew his robe across his breast as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid just then a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door and stalking silently among the attentive group
2165,1502-122615-0020.flac,he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua
2166,1502-122615-0002.flac,go uncas and the open hand are now strangers it is enough
2167,1502-122615-0004.flac,the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced ito the lodge and exhibited the figure of uncas
2168,1502-122615-0012.flac,he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent resolution his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed
2169,1502-122615-0036.flac,suffered him to depart in silence then with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men
2170,1502-122615-0013.flac,he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him my canada father does not forget his children said the chief
2171,1502-122615-0029.flac,like most around him for more than a minute his look too was on the ground but trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention
2172,1502-122615-0011.flac,in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air of some finely moulded statue than a man having life and volition
2173,1502-122615-0023.flac,ten minutes which appeared so many ages to duncan might have passed in this manner and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke
2174,1502-122615-0010.flac,david had not reappeared no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway
2175,1502-122615-0024.flac,has my friend found the moose the young men stagger under their burdens returned magua let read the bens go on the hunting path he will meet them a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name
2176,1502-122615-0000.flac,pope's iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear the hurons are dogs
2177,1502-122615-0034.flac,standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as if sickening at the gaze of men and veiling his face in his blanket he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking
2178,1502-122615-0035.flac,in the privacy of his own abode the sympathy of one like himself aged forlorn and childless the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects and character
2179,1502-122615-0026.flac,leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes
2180,1502-122615-0009.flac,he walked into the lodge and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that though uncas still remained where he had left him
2181,1502-122615-0037.flac,but who has ever found a huron asleep the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed the delawares of the lakes
2182,1502-122615-0007.flac,though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far the terrible scene that had just occurred
2183,1502-122615-0017.flac,the huron was content with the assurance and resuming his pipe he awaited the proper moment to move the impatient heyward innarly execrating the cold customs of the savages
2184,1502-122615-0031.flac,the wicked chippawas cheated by squaw
2185,1502-122615-0027.flac,the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth
2186,1502-122615-0028.flac,suffered their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white headed savage
2187,1502-122615-0005.flac,after this termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran
2188,1502-122615-0030.flac,then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence it was a lie he said i had no son he who is called by that name is forgotten
2189,1502-122615-0006.flac,he retraced his steps to the council lodge resolved to seek and question david in order to put an end to his doubts on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution
2190,103-1241-0041.flac,was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
2191,103-1241-0032.flac,but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
2192,103-1241-0011.flac,i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i daresay she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain
2193,103-1241-0000.flac,chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
2194,103-1241-0035.flac,and a big hat all flowers and knodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
2195,103-1241-0034.flac,but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagine that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while
2196,103-1241-0036.flac,she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
2197,103-1241-0033.flac,i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeson last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it
2198,103-1241-0020.flac,i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
2199,103-1241-0002.flac,matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
2200,103-1241-0040.flac,there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talp if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew
2201,103-1241-0009.flac,she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the station master whistled
2202,103-1241-0004.flac,and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
2203,103-1241-0019.flac,i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night
2204,103-1241-0016.flac,might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
2205,103-1241-0027.flac,who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones
2206,103-1241-0030.flac,isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
2207,103-1241-0037.flac,oh there are a lotmore cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
2208,103-1241-0007.flac,and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the station master locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
2209,103-1241-0010.flac,guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
2210,103-1241-0017.flac,was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
2211,103-1241-0025.flac,it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
2212,103-1241-0013.flac,and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
2213,103-1241-0018.flac,i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
2214,103-1241-0005.flac,he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
2215,103-1241-0026.flac,they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
2216,103-1241-0022.flac,no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
2217,103-1241-0038.flac,and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
2218,103-1241-0029.flac,the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
2219,103-1241-0023.flac,it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
2220,103-1241-0012.flac,maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
2221,103-1241-0001.flac,or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
2222,103-1241-0039.flac,and she said she didn't know an for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how are you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dun'now said matthew
2223,103-1241-0042.flac,he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled wich was very different
2224,103-1241-0008.flac,the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
2225,103-1241-0028.flac,i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
2226,103-1241-0014.flac,a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincy she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
2227,103-1241-0015.flac,her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
2228,103-1241-0031.flac,i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular
2229,103-1241-0003.flac,he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
2230,103-1241-0021.flac,matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
2231,103-1241-0043.flac,and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
2232,103-1241-0006.flac,matthew barely noticing that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
2233,103-1241-0024.flac,we've got to drive a long peace haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough
2234,103-1240-0048.flac,this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
2235,103-1240-0016.flac,yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
2236,103-1240-0007.flac,anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
2237,103-1240-0034.flac,she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
2238,103-1240-0028.flac,yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
2239,103-1240-0025.flac,whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat it all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
2240,103-1240-0029.flac,how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
2241,103-1240-0033.flac,matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in novascotia and he's coming yon the train to night if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
2242,103-1240-0017.flac,the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
2243,103-1240-0051.flac,only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts stricknine in the well i heard of a case over a new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla
2244,103-1240-0001.flac,that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
2245,103-1240-0050.flac,and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
2246,103-1240-0020.flac,bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd rather look at people to be sure
2247,103-1240-0044.flac,so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sand station herself missus rachel prided herself and always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
2248,103-1240-0055.flac,it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather
2249,103-1240-0022.flac,set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
2250,103-1240-0027.flac,there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were every day dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
2251,103-1240-0039.flac,so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
2252,103-1240-0042.flac,so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age
2253,103-1240-0005.flac,helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign mission's auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
2254,103-1240-0013.flac,he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often missus rachel ponderas she might could make nothing of it
2255,103-1240-0014.flac,and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
2256,103-1240-0015.flac,if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
2257,103-1240-0023.flac,one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
2258,103-1240-0052.flac,as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
2259,103-1240-0004.flac,but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
2260,103-1240-0035.flac,said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
2261,103-1240-0036.flac,marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
2262,103-1240-0010.flac,peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill
2263,103-1240-0045.flac,well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
2264,103-1240-0018.flac,had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
2265,103-1240-0011.flac,and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
2266,103-1240-0026.flac,and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
2267,103-1240-0032.flac,marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
2268,103-1240-0056.flac,it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
2269,103-1240-0008.flac,the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sewing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
2270,103-1240-0006.flac,as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
2271,103-1240-0053.flac,missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
2272,103-1240-0041.flac,they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
2273,103-1240-0012.flac,had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
2274,103-1240-0037.flac,what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
2275,103-1240-0040.flac,there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster caneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
2276,103-1240-0002.flac,for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
2277,103-1240-0009.flac,missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sew his turnip see the next afternoon
2278,103-1240-0046.flac,nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
2279,103-1240-0031.flac,but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off to day i thought maybe he was going to the doctor's
2280,103-1240-0049.flac,it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
2281,103-1240-0057.flac,my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fullness of her heart
2282,103-1240-0047.flac,and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what
2283,103-1240-0024.flac,or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlour its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
2284,103-1240-0054.flac,and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
2285,103-1240-0019.flac,barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
2286,103-1240-0030.flac,thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some grey streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
2287,103-1240-0000.flac,chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
2288,103-1240-0003.flac,and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the wise and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbours business by dint of neglecting theirown
2289,103-1240-0043.flac,old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer to day the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train to night
2290,103-1240-0038.flac,missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
2291,103-1240-0021.flac,they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
2292,311-124404-0091.flac,proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart
2293,311-124404-0079.flac,and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighbourhood of the heart
2294,311-124404-0097.flac,thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon its divers ideas what must be understood by the common sense sensus comunus in which these ideas are received by the memory which retains them
2295,311-124404-0029.flac,to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described
2296,311-124404-0119.flac,there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue
2297,311-124404-0098.flac,by the phantasy which can change them in various ways and out of them compose new ideas and which by the same means istributing the animal spirits through the muscles can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways
2298,311-124404-0068.flac,the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted
2299,311-124404-0005.flac,and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering
2300,311-124404-0053.flac,whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture
2301,311-124404-0116.flac,can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter
2302,311-124404-0113.flac,since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows
2303,311-124404-0066.flac,true reasons from mere verisimilitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily
2304,311-124404-0104.flac,for example if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it is hurt and such like
2305,311-124404-0027.flac,and finally how from these ashes
2306,311-124404-0034.flac,but since i had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as the rest that is to say by deducing effects from their causes and by showing
2307,311-124404-0107.flac,that there are no men so dull and stupid not even idiots as to be incapable of joining together different words and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood
2308,311-124404-0103.flac,our thoughts to others for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it admits vocables and even that it amits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs
2309,311-124404-0088.flac,which by being variously perforated serve to separate different species of grain and in the last place what above all is here worthy of observation
2310,311-124404-0047.flac,where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein and those of the tube called the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issuing from the heart sends its branches all over the body
2311,311-124404-0121.flac,because no other causes are observed capable of destroying it
2312,311-124404-0014.flac,and essayed to represent it in such a matter that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul
2313,311-124404-0114.flac,that though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others so that the circumstance that they do better
2314,311-124404-0054.flac,and there form as it were two pouches denominated the oracles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body
2315,311-124404-0023.flac,to that observed in our seas as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such as is likewise observed between the tropics how the mountains seas fountains and rivers might naturally be formed in it
2316,311-124404-0078.flac,and more vivid and warmer immediately after leaving the heart in other words when in the arteries than it was a short time before passing into either in other words when it was in the veins
2317,311-124404-0040.flac,while on the other hand i did afterwards discover these as soon as i supposed god to have created a rational soul and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which i described
2318,311-124404-0101.flac,and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine of human invention and here i specially stayed to show that where there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form and ape or any other irrational animal
2319,311-124404-0092.flac,in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point
2320,311-124404-0033.flac,from the description of inanimate bodies and plants i passed to animals and particularly to man
2321,311-124404-0051.flac,two others at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but precludes its return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart
2322,311-124404-0001.flac,i believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truths are that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage
2323,311-124404-0067.flac,from the very arrangement of the parts which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers and from the nature of the blood as learn from experience as does the motion of a clock from the power
2324,311-124404-0048.flac,i should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the eleven pelicules which like so many small valves open and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities viz
2325,311-124404-0038.flac,as consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently
2326,311-124404-0093.flac,which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it
2327,311-124404-0026.flac,to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others how it can consume almost all bodies or convert them into ashes and smoke
2328,311-124404-0011.flac,i resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces
2329,311-124404-0012.flac,matter sufficient to compose one and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned
2330,311-124404-0118.flac,but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man
2331,311-124404-0100.flac,muscles nerves arteries veins and other parts that are found in the body of each animal such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of god which is incomparably better arranged
2332,311-124404-0115.flac,and could surpass us in all things on the contrary it rather proves that they are destitute of reason and that it is nature whicacts in them according to the disposition of their organs thus it is seen that a clock composed only of wheels and weights
2333,311-124404-0071.flac,cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature whereas quite the contrary would happen were they to bind it below that is between the hand and the opening or were to make the ligature above
2334,311-124404-0110.flac,and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species as well as among men and since some are more capable of being instructed than others it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species
2335,311-124404-0080.flac,in parts more remote from it in the next place
2336,311-124404-0099.flac,to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata or moving machines fabricated by human industry and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones
2337,311-124404-0032.flac,it may be believed without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone things purely material might in course of time
2338,311-124404-0025.flac,i knew nothing except fire which produces light i spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature the manner of its production and support and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light and light without heat
2339,311-124404-0087.flac,and there occupy the place of some other expelled by them and that according to the situation shape or smallness of the pores with which they meet some rather than others flow into certain parts
2340,311-124404-0064.flac,which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before and because the blood which thus enters into the hart passage
2341,311-124404-0120.flac,and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for our fears more than flies and ants in place of which when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the reasons which establish
2342,311-124404-0000.flac,i would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which i deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions
2343,311-124404-0037.flac,and which i thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit for when i examined the kind of functions which might
2344,311-124404-0043.flac,and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tubs viz the hollow vein vena cava
2345,311-124404-0024.flac,and the metals produced in the minds and the plants grown in the fields and in general how all the bodies which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and among other things in the discoveries alluded to
2346,311-124404-0004.flac,to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner
2347,311-124404-0109.flac,and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak
2348,311-124404-0074.flac,to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins there must of necessity
2349,311-124404-0020.flac,and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth to this i likewise added much respecting the substance the situation the motions
2350,311-124404-0106.flac,these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient
2351,311-124404-0017.flac,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way
2352,311-124404-0056.flac,for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood
2353,311-124404-0075.flac,which is in a body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut
2354,311-124404-0117.flac,as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members
2355,311-124404-0058.flac,because the orifices through which they pass are wide
2356,311-124404-0077.flac,is the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins and that from the arteries can only arise from this
2357,311-124404-0086.flac,and the production of the different humours of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being rarefied passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive
2358,311-124404-0105.flac,appositely to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us
2359,311-124404-0046.flac,two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise anappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs
2360,311-124404-0094.flac,i had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treatis which i formerly thought of publishing and after these i had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscle of the human body
2361,311-124404-0083.flac,whence it happens that if the blood be withdrawn from any part the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means and although the heart were as hot as glowing iron it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands
2362,311-124404-0041.flac,will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest
2363,311-124404-0059.flac,are immediately rarefied and dilated by the heat they met with in this way they cause the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances
2364,311-124404-0057.flac,into these the blood of necessity flows from the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these two vessels are always full of blood and their orifices which are turned towards the heart cannot then be closed
2365,311-124404-0052.flac,but prevent its reflex nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pelaciles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation can be adequately closed with two
2366,311-124404-0006.flac,but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade
2367,311-124404-0063.flac,venous artery open anew and allow a passage
2368,311-124404-0009.flac,on all the bodies that are upon the earth since they are either colored or transparent or luminous and finally on man since he is the spectator of these objects
2369,311-124404-0082.flac,and the arterial vein were it not that the blood of the venous artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and rarefies more readily and in a higher degree

2371,311-124404-0007.flac,fearing lest i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind i resolved to expound singly though at considerable length my opinion regarding light then
2372,311-124404-0035.flac,nature must produce them i remained satisfied with the supposition that god formed the body of man wholly like the one of ours as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal confirmation of the organs
2373,311-124404-0095.flac,to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth although no longer animated what changes must take place in the brain to produce
2374,311-124404-0003.flac,and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstration of the geometers had formerly appeared and yet i venture to state that not only have i found means
2375,311-124404-0010.flac,further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned
2376,311-124404-0049.flac,three at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out three at the entrance to the arterial vein
2377,311-124404-0111.flac,should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack brained unless the soul of brutes
2378,311-124404-0084.flac,and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb
2379,311-124404-0022.flac,i came next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i had expressly supposed that god had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly
2380,311-124404-0018.flac,as to present the appearance of heavens how in the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets and others a sun and fixed stars and making a digression at this stage on the subject of light
2381,311-124404-0073.flac,from coming forward through the arteries because these are situated below the veins and their coverings from their greater consistency are more difficult to compress and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them
2382,311-124404-0060.flac,of the two vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels through which they pass out
2383,311-124404-0076.flac,so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there are many other circumstances which evince that what i have alleged
2384,311-124404-0044.flac,which is the principl receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vena artheriosa inappropriately so denominated
2385,311-124404-0072.flac,the opening very tight for it is manifest that the tie moderately straightened while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins cannot on that account prevent new blood
2386,311-124404-0031.flac,so that even although he had from the beginning giving it no other form than that of chaos provided only he had established certain laws of nature and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do
2387,311-124404-0055.flac,and finally that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel
2388,311-124404-0045.flac,presently dispersed themselves all over the lungs in the second place the cavity in the left side
2389,311-124404-0112.flac,and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brutes speak although we do not understand their language
2390,311-124404-0019.flac,i expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be
2391,4788-94904-0010.flac,and is in direct contact with the public to it principally the hopes and fears of individuals are directed and by it both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye
2392,4788-94904-0026.flac,a race who have been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body
2393,4788-94904-0016.flac,or of some one with whom they are connected as adherents or dependents the small class who in this state of public feeling gain the command of the representative body for the most part use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune if the executive is weak
2394,4788-94904-0007.flac,whether monarchical or popular in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made indifference to it
2395,4788-94904-0008.flac,rather than positive opposition are the obstacles to be expected these however are as fatal and may be as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion it being easier in most cases to change the direction of an active feeling than to create one
2396,4788-94904-0035.flac,then another of the immediate oppressors his progress to ascendency was slow but it resulted from successively taking advantage of opportunities which offered themselves only to him it was therefore sure and in proportion as it was accomplished
2397,4788-94904-0037.flac,under his protection numerous communities were formed which knew no one above them but the king
2398,4788-94904-0001.flac,that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them though this is not true universally for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity
2399,4788-94904-0017.flac,the country is distracted by mere struggles for place if strong it makes itself despotic at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives or such of them as are capable of giving trouble by a share of the spoil
2400,4788-94904-0030.flac,or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified by extreme passiveness
2401,4788-94904-0031.flac,and ready submission to tyranny if a people thus prostrated by character and circumstances could obtain representative institutions they would inevitably choose their tyrants as their representatives and the yoke would be made heavier on them by the contrivance which
2402,4788-94904-0022.flac,they would certainly as in spanish america keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war a despotism not even legal but of illegal violence would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers
2403,4788-94904-0014.flac,these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfil the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution
2404,4788-94904-0018.flac,and the only fruit produced by national representation is that in addition to those who really govern there is an assembly quartered on the public and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are interested is at all likely to be removed
2405,4788-94904-0009.flac,in a state previously passive when a people have no sufficient value for and attachment to a representative constitution they have next to no chance of retaining it
2406,4788-94904-0013.flac,they seldom obtain a footing at all and if they do are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government or any party leader who can muster force for ecoupt de main is willing to run some small risk for absolute power
2407,4788-94904-0033.flac,even when the king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief feudatories the great advantage which he derived from being but one has been recognized by french historians to him the eyes of all the locally oppressed were turned
2408,4788-94904-0015.flac,when nobody or only some small fraction feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion the electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their private interest or the interest of their locality
2409,4788-94904-0024.flac,there are others in which it possibly might exist but in which some other form of government would be preferable these are principally when the people in order to advance in civilization have some lesson to learn some habit not yet acquired
2410,4788-94904-0011.flac,unless therefore the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive is always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience
2411,4788-94904-0027.flac,a representative assembly drawn from among themselves would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination it would refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose on their savage independence any improving restraint
2412,4788-94904-0002.flac,as upon the degree in which they possess certain special requisites requisites however so closely connected with their degree of general advancement that any variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule
2413,4788-94904-0034.flac,he was the object of hope and reliance throughout the kingdom while each local potentate was only powerful within a more or less confined space at his hands refuge and protection were sought from every part of the country against first one
2414,4788-94904-0029.flac,but as it is merely personal it rarely effects any change in the general habits of the people unless the prophet like mohammed is also a military chief and goes forth the armed apostle of a new religion
2415,4788-94904-0019.flac,when however the evil stops here the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which though not an invariable are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation
2416,4788-94904-0023.flac,and the name and forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from attaining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized
2417,4788-94904-0004.flac,who have gained power over the country are disposed to offer it the boon to individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant since if no other objection can be made to their enterprise than that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side
2418,4788-94904-0020.flac,that the place hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly though they contribute little or nothing directly to good government nor even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive
2419,4788-94904-0028.flac,a military leader is the only superior to whom they will submit except occasionally some prophit supposed to be inspired from above or conjurer regarded as possessing miraculous power these may exercise a temporary ascendancy
2420,4788-94904-0032.flac,might be expected to lighten it on the contrary many a people has gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central authority whose position has made it the rival and has ended by making it the master of the local despots
2421,4788-94904-0012.flac,and is sure to be well supported in doing so representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of their being endangered if too little valued for this
2422,4788-94904-0021.flac,which exists in that country this benefit however is entirely dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary king if instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler these selfish and sordid factions struggled for the chief place itself
2423,4788-94904-0003.flac,that they should be willing and able to fulfil the duties and discharge the functions which it imposes on them the willingness of the people to accept representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler or a foreign nation or nations
2424,4788-94904-0039.flac,though generally much restricted in practice was mainly instrumental in carrying the people through a necessary stage of improvement which representative government if real would most likely have prevented them from entering upon
2425,4788-94904-0000.flac,we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement as they range lower and lower in development
2426,4788-94904-0005.flac,they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at when opinion is really adverse its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself
2427,4788-94904-0038.flac,and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation in this manner a central power despotic in principle
2428,4788-94904-0006.flac,the contrary case is not indeed unexampled there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be
2429,4788-94904-0036.flac,it abated in the oppressed portion of the community the habit of submitting to oppression the king's interest lay in encouraging all partial attempts on the part of the serfs to emancipate themselves from their masters and placed themselves in immediate subordination to himself
2430,4788-94904-0025.flac,to the acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an impediment the most obvious of these cases is the one already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization that of obedience
2431,4788-294466-0011.flac,when jerry and i were little we were playmates i spent days at the ranch sometimes her sweet face was very sad as she ended with until mother died when i was eight then you came east to boarding school and became like a sister to me
2432,4788-294466-0020.flac,i do believe mister harvey has a letter for us dora said the old man had shuffled into the dark well of his store a moment later he reappeared with several letters and a newspaper good
2433,4788-294466-0010.flac,and jerry's mother taught a little desert school over near the newcomb ranch she didn't teach long though for that very first vacation she married jerry's cowboy father after that mother and missus newcomb were good friends naturally being brides and neighbors
2434,4788-294466-0014.flac,noticing that dora was deep in thought she asked lightly won't you say it out loud why of course i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loon's rock house because he had to do the milking mary replied simply
2435,4788-294466-0021.flac,dora exclaimed as she rode close to the porch thanks a lot she called brightly up to the old man who was handing the packet down over the sagging wooden rail his friendly toothless smile was directed at the smaller girl
2436,4788-294466-0012.flac,far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them
2437,4788-294466-0026.flac,you wait until dick has been on the desert long enough to get a coat of tan he may surprise you
2438,4788-294466-0006.flac,they're nice boys aren't they mary said i've always wished i had a brother and i do believe jerry is going to be just like one aloud dora replied i have noticed that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought
2439,4788-294466-0031.flac,then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom she asked eagerly may i tell dad an adventure we've had missus farley middle aged kind faced shook her head smiling down at the girl not to night please won't to morrow do
2440,4788-294466-0000.flac,mary's nettlesome brown pony was hard to quiet until jerry reached out a strong brown hand and patted its head mary lifted startled blue eyes jerry what do you make of that she asked
2441,4788-294466-0023.flac,pale feller with specxs on as her son ain't he yes mister harvey dick is missus farley's son mary took time in a friendly way to satisfy the old man's curiosity
2442,4788-294466-0009.flac,when she spoke she said it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have my mother met dad in bisby where he was a mining engineer
2443,4788-294466-0004.flac,she smiled at her friend mary not wishing to appear foolishly timid said in as courageous a voice as she could muster of course we're not afraid good bye boys we'll see you to morrow
2444,4788-294466-0005.flac,feeling assured that the girls were all right the boys went at a gallop down the road and across the desert valley to the newcomb ranch
2445,4788-294466-0028.flac,a bright black eyed mexican boy of about ten ran out to the road as the girls approached come on emanuel mary sang down to him you may put up our horses and earn a dime the small boy's white teeth flashed in a delighted grin
2446,4788-294466-0017.flac,i'm crazy about mysteries as you know and if there really is one about that rock house i want to try to solve it she said no more about it just then as they had reached the old ghost town of gleeson
2447,4788-294466-0024.flac,dick has been going to the arizona state university this winter to be near his mother she's a widow and he's her only son her husband was a doctor and they lived back in boston before he died do tell the old man wagged his head sympathetically
2448,4788-294466-0030.flac,its broad porch and adobe pillars here her mother had come as a bride here mary had been born eight happy years they had spent together before her mother died after mary had been taken east to school her father had returned
2449,4788-294466-0002.flac,he must have been dead for years if he was old when jerry's father was a boy of course dora less inclined to be imaginative replied then to the cowboy she said in her practical matter of fact way
2450,4788-294466-0007.flac,oh mary how blind you are dreamily the younger girl was saying that's because we were playmates when we were little so very long ago oh my how ancient we are dora said teasingly
2451,4788-294466-0027.flac,some with broken windows and doors others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls the only sign of life was in three small adobes where poor mexican families lived broken windows in two of the houses were stuffed with rags
2452,4788-294466-0018.flac,in the long ago days when the town had been teeming with life picturesque looking miners and ranchers had sat there tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns to day the chairs were empty an old man shrivelled
2453,4788-294466-0022.flac,he said miss farley yer nurse woman came down ter mail some letters a spell back then before mary could reply he continued in his shrill wavering voice
2454,4788-294466-0013.flac,it was very still not a sound was to be heard now and then a rabbit darted past silently how peaceful this hour is on the desert mary began glancing at her friend who was riding so close at her side
2455,4788-294466-0016.flac,i don't believe he will tell us about that i acted so like a scarecat all the time we were there he won't ever take us there again and he probably won't tell us the story either then i'll find it out some other way dora declared
2456,4788-294466-0025.flac,buston brock's mary smiled in appreciation of the old man's joke no jerry won't expect dick to do that right at first he's official fence mender just at present dora defended the absent boy mister harvey
2457,4788-294466-0029.flac,his brown feet raced so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square two storied adobe near the mountains emanuel was there to lead their horses around back mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flouer edged walk
2458,4788-294466-0008.flac,please remember that you are only one year younger than i am and i refuse to be called elderly mary smiled faintly but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist a wonderfully pretty wistful little girl
2459,4788-294466-0019.flac,gray bearded unkempt but with kind gray eyes deep sunken under shaggy brows stood in the open door he smiled out at them in a friendly way then beckoned with a bony finger
2460,4788-294466-0001.flac,we couldn't have imagined that gunshot and surely the horses hert it also jerry's smile was reassuring twas the story that frightened you girls i reckon he said glancing about and up and down the road as he spoke
2461,4788-294466-0003.flac,hurry along home to your milking jerry and dick don't you bother to come with us now that you're working on the newcome ranch you ought to be there it's only a few miles up over this sunshiny road to gleeson we aren't the least bit afraid to ride home alone are we
2462,4788-294466-0015.flac,dora nodded so he said then she hastened to add oh don't think i'm inferring that jerry told an untruth but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glanced up startled dora bellman she said
2463,4788-91208-0034.flac,and all his relations to his fellow creatures the very birds about his dwelling seem to recognize it it is this noble sentiment which infuses a soul of life into his teachings and the enunciation and acting out of which constitute him
2464,4788-91208-0028.flac,in which these contradictory attributes inhere but it was against a corresponding being the infinite that mister mill was arguing it is this that he calls a
2465,4788-91208-0027.flac,by a mistake he fell into the necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete he acknowledged the force of mister mills's argument that the infinite must include a farrago of contradictions
2466,4788-91208-0024.flac,of the contradictory of a proposition is a proof of its truth coequal with experience but that its value transcends experience experience may tell us what is but it is by the impossibility of conceiving it otherwise
2467,4788-91208-0030.flac,and prescribe to him a rule of life that person has a religion and though every one naturally prefers his own religion to any other all must admit that if the object of his attachment and of this feeling of duty is the aggregate of our fellow creatures
2468,4788-91208-0033.flac,never has the libel of humanity involved in the current theology been more forcibly pointed out with its constant appeal to low motives of personal gain
2469,4788-91208-0032.flac,and we join with him in contemning as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange an eternity of personal enjoyment
2470,4788-91208-0031.flac,this religion of the infidel cannot in honesty and conscience be called an intrinsically bad one many indeed may be unable to believe that this object is capable of gathering round it feelings sufficiently strong
2471,4788-91208-0029.flac,and regarded as the reductio ad absurdisium of the transcendental philosophy mister mill's religious tendencies may very well be gathered from a passage in his review of august comte a philosopher with whom he agreed on all points
2472,4788-91208-0026.flac,as mister mill says the name of god is veiled under two extremely abstract phrases the infinite and the absolute so profound and friendly a thinker as the late mister grote held this raising of the veil inexpedient but he proved
2473,4788-91208-0025.flac,in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy mister mill gives battle to this mode of thought after reviewing in an opening chapter the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge
2474,4788-91208-0006.flac,of the mass of original thought that still remains to mister mill's credit the great critical power that could gather valuable truth from so many discordant sources and the wonderful synthetic ability required to weld these and his own contributions
2475,4788-91208-0014.flac,but are now dead we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal we might surely without any logical inconsequence have concluded at once from those instances that the duke of wellington is mortal
2476,4788-91208-0019.flac,and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin it was this taken with his theory of the syllogism which worked the great change both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy
2477,4788-91208-0008.flac,in deducing from general propositions other propositions less general it was even asserted confidently that nothing more was to be expected that an inductive logic was impossible this conception of logical science necessitated
2478,4788-91208-0007.flac,into one organic whole when mister mill commenced his labors the only logic recognized was the syllogistic
2479,4788-91208-0022.flac,the biggest lion in the path was the doctrine of so called necessary truth this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth and a standard as he was easily able to show
2480,4788-91208-0013.flac,was but imperfectly realized and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of mister mill altered all this he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars nor from particulars to generals but from particulars to particulars
2481,4788-91208-0015.flac,the mortality of john thomas and others is after all the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the duke of wellington not one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a general proposition
2482,4788-91208-0010.flac,incapable of being proved from other propositions it followed that if they were known to us at all they must be original data of consciousness here was a perfect paradise of question begging the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed
2483,4788-91208-0016.flac,we not only may according to mister mill reason from some particular instances to others but we frequently do so as however the instances which are sufficient to prove one fresh instance
2484,4788-91208-0018.flac,all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic and to induction accordingly mister mill devoted his chief attention for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic
2485,4788-91208-0003.flac,mister mill's achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society he is
2486,4788-91208-0011.flac,it could of course be fashioned according to the particular conclusion it was called in to prove thus an artificial ignorance as locke calls it was produced which had the effect of sanctifying prejudice by recognizing so called necessities of thought
2487,4788-91208-0004.flac,the structure raised by adam smith malphus and ricardo but raised it at least one story higher his inestimable system of logic was a revolution it hardly needs of course to be said that he owed much to his predecessors
2488,4788-91208-0005.flac,that he borrowed from whewell much of his classification from brown the chief lines of his theory of causation from sir john herschel the main principles of the inductive methods those who think this a disparagement of his work must have very little conception
2489,4788-91208-0001.flac,the pointsman moves a handle and the foaming giant that would it may be have sped on to his destruction and that of the passive crew who follow in his rear is shunted to another line running in a different direction and to a more desirable goal

2555,2989-138035-0066.flac,and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots for they were six half wine jars each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house
2556,2989-138035-0049.flac,even were it under gilded ceilings and so turned aside a little out of the road
2557,2989-138035-0018.flac,one would be for choosing her father's servant and another some one she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken bully

2559,2989-138035-0001.flac,and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that every one felt who saw don quixote for the first time and were dying to know who this man so different from ordinary men could be don quixote saluted them and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his
2560,2989-138035-0032.flac,though they may have been born in mahalahonda i say of discrimination because there are many who are not so and discrimination is the grammar of good language if it be accompanied by practice ay sirs for my sins have studied canon law at salamonca
2561,2989-138035-0040.flac,by my faith senor bachelor if your worship takes my advice you will never challenge any one to fence again only to wrestle and throw the bar for you have the youth and strength for that but as for these fencers as they call them i have heard say
2562,2989-138035-0013.flac,who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the truth be told ungrudgingly he is the most agile youth we know a mighty thrower of the bar a first rate wrestler and a great ball player he runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat
2563,2989-138035-0004.flac,for all that however they regarded him with admiration and respect and one of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed road as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship come with us
2564,2989-138035-0044.flac,it grew dark but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if theye was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it they heard too the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments flutes drums
2565,2989-138035-0050.flac,as to the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don diego came back to his mind
2566,2989-138035-0026.flac,for love i have heard say
2567,2989-138035-0053.flac,sprang to his feet and called to his squire sancho who was still snoring
2568,2989-138035-0025.flac,and tell me is there any one who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune no faith and between a woman's yes and no i wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin
2569,2989-138035-0035.flac,who will make me turn my back and that there is not one in the world i will not compel to give ground as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself replied the master of fence
2570,2989-138035-0022.flac,if he sleeps at all it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast sometimes he gazes at the sky
2571,2989-138035-0070.flac,and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by of cooks and cook maids there were over fifty all clean brisk and blythe in the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little suckling pigs which sewn up there
2572,2989-138035-0074.flac,get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two and much good may they do you i don't see one said sancho wait a bit said the cook sinner that i am how particular and bashful you are
2573,2989-138035-0042.flac,and they were better friends than ever and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword
2574,2989-138035-0008.flac,he has provided dancers too not only sword but also bell dancers for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection of shoe dancers i say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things
2575,2989-138035-0037.flac,but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the licentiate sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset and made him kiss it as if it were a relic though not as devoutly as relics are and ought to be kissed
2576,2989-138035-0076.flac,fall to friend and take the edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner time comes
2577,2989-138028-0064.flac,the bread eaten and the company dispersed
2578,2989-138028-0001.flac,but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home
2579,2989-138028-0005.flac,there must be all sorts in the world
2580,2989-138028-0050.flac,and that the same be paid me out of your estate for i don't care to stand on rewards which either come late or ill or never at all god help me with my own
2581,2989-138028-0026.flac,and not by spending as he pleases but by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable well bred courteous gentle mannered and kindly not haughty arrogant or censorous
2582,2989-138028-0067.flac,and so there's nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicile in such a way that it can't be provoked
2583,2989-138028-0071.flac,all that was requisite for the journey ready and procure a closed helmet which don quixote said he must by all means take samson offered him one as he knew a friend of his
2584,2989-138028-0048.flac,and so say i said don quixote continue sancho my friend go on you talk pearls to day the fact is continued sancho
2585,2989-138028-0061.flac,on then my lord don quixote beautiful and brave let your worship and highness set out to day rather than to morrow and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose
2586,2989-138028-0012.flac,wield trenchant blades of damascus steel or club studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than one seen
2587,2989-138028-0051.flac,and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost
2588,2989-138028-0025.flac,for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants and even should we find one it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebian lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
2589,2989-138028-0028.flac,even though he know him not will fail to recognize and set him down as one of good blood and it would be strange were it not so praise has ever been the reward of virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation
2590,2989-138028-0009.flac,whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing about but i do
2591,2989-138028-0033.flac,i know as our great castilian poet says that it is by rugged path like these they go that scale the heights of immortality unreached by those that falter here below
2592,2989-138028-0060.flac,of the honour of virgins of the aid of widows and of the support of wives and other matters of this kind appertaining belonging proper and peculiar
2593,2989-138028-0062.flac,with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight errant squire but heaven forbid that to gratify my own inclination i should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts
2594,2989-138028-0043.flac,and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place
2595,2989-138028-0003.flac,and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him whereupon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majesty's court are there no knights there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right there should be
2596,2989-138028-0073.flac,samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on
2597,2989-138028-0074.flac,with whom he had previously discussed the subject
2598,2989-138028-0037.flac,so that to bring him around again ever so little cost me more than six hundred eggs
2599,2989-138028-0006.flac,there is a great difference between one and another for the courtiers without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst
2600,2989-138028-0055.flac,and in short i mean to say and i do say that if you don't like to come on reward with me and run the same chance that i run god be with you
2601,2989-138028-0010.flac,and you must know besides that the true knight errant though he may see ten giants that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them and that go each of them on two tall towers by way of legs and whose arms are like the mass of mighty ships and each eye like a great mill wheel
2602,2989-138028-0034.flac,i can tell you niece replied don quixote if these chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties there would be nothing that i could not do nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands particularly cages and toothpicks
2603,2989-138028-0007.flac,but we the true nights errant measure the whole earth with our own feet exposed to the sun to the cold to the air to the inclemencies of heaven by day and night on foot and on horseback
2604,2989-138028-0039.flac,say the prayer of santa apolonia that is if you know it for i will come presently and you will see miracles woe is me cried the housekeeper
2605,2989-138028-0045.flac,for i know not what i am so focile means
2606,2989-138028-0000.flac,chapter six of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper one of the most important chapters in the whole history
2607,2989-138028-0002.flac,what answer god will give to your complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer either i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions that present every day
2608,2989-138028-0075.flac,his auforias furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals and his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former
2609,2989-138028-0038.flac,that it can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress housekeeper that is all
2610,2989-138028-0047.flac,but to come to the point what does teresa say teresa says
2611,2989-138028-0044.flac,once or twice as well as i remember replied sancho
2612,2989-138028-0035.flac,at this moment there came a knocking at the door
2613,2989-138028-0011.flac,and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armor the shells of a certain fish
2614,2989-138028-0041.flac,i know what i am saying mistress housekeeper
2615,2989-138028-0029.flac,there are two roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and honours one is that of letters the other that of arms
2616,2989-138028-0040.flac,that would do if it was the toothache my master had
2617,2989-138028-0059.flac,any longer curbed and checked for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs
2618,2989-138028-0031.flac,and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills fate ordains reason requires and above all my own inclination favours for knowing us as i do the countless toils that are the accompanients of knight errantry
2619,2989-138028-0027.flac,but above all by being charitable for by two maravettis given with the cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues i have named
2620,2989-138028-0030.flac,i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road
2621,2989-138028-0063.flac,let this new samson remain in his own country and bringing honor to it bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of the venerable parents for i will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not deign to accompany me
2622,2989-138028-0032.flac,i know too the infinite blessings that are attained by it i know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of vice broad and spacious i know their ends and goals are different for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death

2624,2989-138028-0024.flac,of countless princes monarchs lords meids assyrians persians greeks and barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing
2625,2989-138028-0016.flac,but some there are that might have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for they are not all courteous or mannerly some are ill conditioned scoundrels nor is it every one that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck
2626,2989-138028-0052.flac,and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs
2627,2989-138028-0053.flac,please to return to my service well and good but to suppose that i am going to disturb or inhenge the ancient usage of knight errantry it is all nonsense and so my sancho get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your teresa
2628,2989-138028-0018.flac,god bless me said the niece that you should know so much uncle

2630,2989-138028-0004.flac,to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the king's majesty then might not your worship said she be one of those that without stirring a step serve their king and lord in his court
2631,2989-138028-0020.flac,all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they had attained surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintained them
2632,2989-138028-0069.flac,as he was there described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be revoked

2635,2989-138028-0056.flac,the archwag samson came forward and embracing him as he had done before said with a loud voice o flower of knight errantry o shining light of arms o honour and mirror of the spanish nation
2636,2989-138028-0014.flac,i would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be the young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights errant
2637,2989-138028-0017.flac,and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen
2638,2989-138028-0015.flac,for he was the most humble minded and courteous knight of his time
2639,2989-138028-0068.flac,so i offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally as well and better than all the squires that served knights errant in times past or present
2640,2989-138028-0049.flac,and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased to give him

2642,2989-138028-0021.flac,and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness
2643,2989-138028-0022.flac,those that had a humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve
2644,2989-138028-0008.flac,nor do we only know enemies in pictures but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword
2645,2989-138028-0046.flac,and submit to what i teach thee i would bet said sancho that from the very first you understood me and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders may be so replied don quixote
2646,2989-138028-0019.flac,and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above all a cabalero when you are not one
2647,2989-138028-0066.flac,no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow which i can't deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take it amiss
2648,2989-138028-0013.flac,and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second or more properly speaking first kind of knights errant for as we read in their histories
2649,2989-138028-0042.flac,replied carrasco and with this the housekeeper retired
2650,2989-138028-0054.flac,benequedom but if not we remain friends for if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not lack pigeons and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and a good grievance better than a bad compensation
2651,2989-138028-0058.flac,for i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did i not urge and persuade this night not to keep the might of his strong arm an the virtue of his valiant spirit
2652,2989-138028-0070.flac,in fine don quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great corrosco who was now their oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence by which time they could have
2653,7113-86041-0047.flac,and gathered the golden apples from the trees and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments
2654,7113-86041-0031.flac,the scene of this strange adventure thinking as people will in sorrow that there might be some mistake after all but when he reached the spot behold all was changed again
2655,7113-86041-0014.flac,beyond them flowed a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide
2656,7113-86041-0026.flac,running hither and thither in high glee and calling merrily to each other at last when they were quite weary the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool
2657,7113-86041-0042.flac,who is there i can find for her to talk to
2658,7113-86041-0009.flac,but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful and rubezl soon left him and went to be shepherd to his next neighbor
2659,7113-86041-0023.flac,as the wandering breeze scattered it daisies and forget me nots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable
2660,7113-86041-0085.flac,unless he could be for ever chattering
2661,7113-86041-0002.flac,for rubezl loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing
2662,7113-86041-0079.flac,caught him in her cruel beak and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more
2663,7113-86041-0055.flac,to take part in the games of the princess till at last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows she shuddered
2664,7113-86041-0043.flac,carrots turnips and radishes and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who sat pensive in the shade of the rosebower loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow
2665,7113-86041-0022.flac,the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed flowed in silence now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt
2666,7113-86041-0033.flac,the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princess's playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some
2667,7113-86041-0045.flac,take this little many colored wand and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see with this he left her and the princess without an instant's delay opened the basket
2668,7113-86041-0086.flac,all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learnt so he soon fluttered away
2669,7113-86041-0059.flac,sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will do but do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots
2670,7113-86041-0048.flac,the gnome had given to his hoped for bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes veils girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired
2671,7113-86041-0006.flac,came the music of the shepherd's pipe the strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests who without saying by your leave or with your leave
2672,7113-86041-0093.flac,and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now
2673,7113-86041-0017.flac,when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young man that was the best way and he fell in love with ta girl then and there
2674,7113-86041-0065.flac,dear queen of my heart answered he i pray you to forgive my carelessness i promised more than i could perform i have shought all over the land for the roots you desire but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty cellars
2675,7113-86041-0062.flac,and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow
2676,7113-86041-0110.flac,to the depths of his underground kingdom
2677,7113-86041-0077.flac,then and there after that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting hop little cricket to ratibor and chirp in his ear that i love him only
2678,7113-86041-0103.flac,but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name but only
2679,7113-86041-0100.flac,into the arms of her beloved prince ratibor meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again till his back ached and his head swam and he could no longer put two and two together
2680,7113-86041-0082.flac,now prince ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief one day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud
2681,7113-86041-0088.flac,she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love and the idea pleased him mightily the next day
2682,7113-86041-0091.flac,your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears why tears beloved one cried the gnome anxiously
2683,7113-86041-0078.flac,but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains so the cricket hopped off gaily determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a long legged stork who was prancing along the same road
2684,7113-86041-0012.flac,down to his underground palace very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind but as time went on he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him and thought he would take another look at the upper world
2685,7113-86041-0054.flac,while brunilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away
2686,7113-86041-0029.flac,but which had swallowed up the princess before their eyes they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her but in vain they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool and could not keep under water for a second
2687,7113-86041-0041.flac,and in a thousand waves strove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants
2688,7113-86041-0076.flac,so the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up
2689,7113-86041-0090.flac,and her flowing veil sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes
2690,7113-86041-0000.flac,rubazl over all the vast under world the mountain gnome rubazl was lord and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through
2691,7113-86041-0074.flac,for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter had now come to their full size day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them conjuring up now this longed for person and now that
2692,7113-86041-0080.flac,this time she changed the turnip into a magpie flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said she till you come to ratibor my love
2693,7113-86041-0001.flac,and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies
2694,7113-86041-0060.flac,the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired but as the sap dried up they withered away but never trouble yourself about that dearest one a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right
2695,7113-86041-0005.flac,and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounded cosy looking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows
2696,7113-86041-0013.flac,where stood a charming maiden fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon around her upon the grass lay her young companions as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game
2697,7113-86041-0073.flac,in her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity and at last she hit upon a plan by this time spring once more reined in the valley and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth
2698,7113-86041-0039.flac,and nightingale sang in every bush as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys sometimes gazing at the moon sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment
2699,7113-86041-0098.flac,pretty looks and words as for the maiden no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand
2700,7113-86041-0064.flac,by the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off
2701,7113-86041-0018.flac,the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country and she often wandered in the forest with her playfellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits till the mid day heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn
2702,7113-86041-0024.flac,were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes
2703,7113-86041-0032.flac,the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished and so had the marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old
2704,7113-86041-0019.flac,by the brook to rest or to bathe in the cool waters on this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood this
2705,7113-86041-0028.flac,and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair loudly did they weep and wail running about the brink of the pool which looked so shallow and so clear
2706,7113-86041-0057.flac,lay the once frolicsome benny with all four feet stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion the horrified princess fled to the door
2707,7113-86041-0040.flac,but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome however he soon perceived her melancholy
2708,7113-86041-0068.flac,and disguising himself as a farmer bought an ass in the nearest market town and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip carrot and radish seed with this he sowed a great field
2709,7113-86041-0051.flac,she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand and soon had all her maidens about her and even as she had two tiny radishes to spare
2710,7113-86041-0097.flac,this time to his great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princess's
2711,7113-86041-0053.flac,they played from morning to night only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom
2712,7113-86041-0094.flac,ask some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience an my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love be it so answered the crafty maiden then give me
2713,7113-86041-0038.flac,on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady which pleased the eye of the princess the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples
2714,7113-86041-0104.flac,echo answered in the marble halls there was neither voice nor footstep then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace
2715,7113-86041-0010.flac,and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away that they too prospered under his care and not one was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well earned wages
2716,7113-86041-0084.flac,but the magpie in the tree who like
2717,7113-86041-0075.flac,just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another purpose in view one day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover fly
2718,7113-86041-0087.flac,while the prince hurried back to his castle together together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall the princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of scape
2719,7113-86041-0035.flac,they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her fathers seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch
2720,7113-86041-0044.flac,no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling
2721,7113-86041-0070.flac,he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him but that was a mistake for the truth was that another image already filled her heart the young prince ratibor whose lands joined her father's had won the heart of the princess
2722,7113-86041-0021.flac,weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed and when the maidens returned at noon to their favorite resting place they stood lost in amazement and almost fancied that they must be dreaming
2723,7113-86041-0034.flac,sprite or goblin and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy
2724,7113-86041-0008.flac,he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man so taking the form of an old field laborer he entered the service of a farmer under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly
2725,7113-86041-0016.flac,he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels and a nest of field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens
2726,7113-86041-0109.flac,and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures
2727,7113-86041-0015.flac,the sight of the maiden so pleased the nome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven
2728,7113-86041-0069.flac,and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds thus fostered they grew and flourished marvelously
2729,7113-86041-0036.flac,wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he it was told her all about himself
2730,7113-86041-0037.flac,and his great underground kingdom and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendor
2731,7113-86041-0049.flac,and showed so much taste that nobody
2732,7113-86041-0108.flac,he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princess's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief all was lonely empty sorrowful
2733,7113-86041-0007.flac,nor did he wish to interfere with their doings but left them in quiet possession of their homes as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves
2734,7113-86041-0107.flac,and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stole once more through every room with many sighs and lamentations
2735,7113-86041-0052.flac,whose name was beny and now all went cheerfully in the castle the princess gave to each of the maidens her task and never was mistress better serbed for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed
2736,7113-86041-0096.flac,he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again
2737,7113-86041-0067.flac,and then without fail you shall have your poppets to play with almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without deigning to answer him the gnome however
2738,7113-86041-0083.flac,which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory forever thereupon he caught up a great stone
2739,7113-86041-0081.flac,and bid him come with horses and men the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley the magpie listened hopped awhile from branch to branch and then darted away
2740,7113-86041-0046.flac,this sudden appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden
2741,7113-86041-0095.flac,that shall be the test of your truth towards me unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task
2742,7113-86041-0011.flac,so he ran away and went to serve the judge here he upheld the law with might and main and was a terror to thieves and evil doers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law
2743,7113-86041-0099.flac,which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself
2744,7113-86041-0027.flac,which certainly did look very inviting and they all went gaily to this new amusement the princess was ready first but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down down down she sank
2745,7113-86041-0004.flac,to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills but the next time he ventured above ground what was his surprise to find everything changed the dark woods were hew down
2746,7113-86041-0025.flac,but at length curiosity prevailed and she and her companions explored to their hearts content
2747,7113-86041-0050.flac,the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before
2748,7113-86041-0056.flac,and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones with bent backs and trembling limbs who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth
2749,7113-86041-0106.flac,and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years but his fury was vain the thunder clouds melted away into a soft mist
2750,7113-86041-0102.flac,as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her but alas she was no longer there he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond
2751,7113-86041-0063.flac,to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found
2752,5390-24512-0042.flac,is the middle of all the words
2753,5390-24512-0007.flac,to crucify jesus of nazareth and to free barabas but in choosing the rebel barabas
2754,5390-24512-0022.flac,ah my countrymen he cried we did nothing without god in the past but now you are fighting against him had god judged you worthy of freedom he would have punished the romans as he did the assyrians long ago
2755,5390-24512-0049.flac,just so was it with the hebrew copies of god's word locked up in a dead language kept close away from the world they were like the jar of wheat which could not grow
2756,5390-24512-0016.flac,and he sent a great army against jerusalem the jews shut the gates of their city and so began the awful siege of jerusalem and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies
2757,5390-24512-0032.flac,over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often and beside whose shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy a great and beautiful college it was with broad terraced gardens
2758,5390-24512-0040.flac,that copy must be destroyed not satisfied with all these directions the master taught his scholar to count the letters of every book
2759,5390-24512-0019.flac,that mothers even snatch the bread from their own children's mouths look over the walls o people of jerusalem the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide
2760,5390-24512-0000.flac,for although the jewish family of the herods reigned over judea they only held their throne under the roman emperor this the jews could not endure they longed to be a free and independent nation once again
2761,5390-24512-0026.flac,and the golden candlestick and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen rome alas for the holy city over which the saviour of the world had stood and wept forty years before
2762,5390-24512-0027.flac,knowing the suffering that lay before her these jews are dangerous we must not allow them to rebuild their city or to become a separate people again as a nation they must cease to exist
2763,5390-24512-0020.flac,hard merciless as was the roman general even he grew sick with horror at last and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews promising them their lives if they would give up the city
2764,5390-24512-0014.flac,the romans believed them and opened their gates but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man as they died the roman soldiers whom not even death could terrify
2765,5390-24512-0024.flac,which still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sunbeams struck full on its golden roof then redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof
2766,5390-24512-0037.flac,that is clean according to the law of moses the ink you write with must be of a pure black made only from a mixture of soot charcoal and honey
2767,5390-24512-0017.flac,he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within
2768,5390-24512-0033.flac,so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible as we have seen the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god just as it stood they had begun even in our lord's day
2769,5390-24512-0031.flac,they allowed the jewish teachers to continue the synagogue services in other parts of palestine and to teach in their colleges the most famous jewish college of these days was at tiberius on the shores of the sea of galilee
2770,5390-24512-0038.flac,though you know the whole book of the law by heart you must not write a single word from memory but raise your eyes to your copy and pronounce the word aloud before trusting it to your pen
2771,5390-24512-0030.flac,the jews were now no longer a nation they had become merely a body of people led by their rabbis or teachers of the law but they were still the people of the book
2772,5390-24512-0045.flac,and the breadth of each column had to be thirty letters wide there are eleven verses in the book of the law beginning and ending with en there are forty verses in which lo is read three times and so on and so on
2773,5390-24512-0041.flac,is the middle letter of all the five books of moses
2774,5390-24512-0013.flac,where the roman soldiers were quartered and cried out to the garrison within that their lives should be spared if they would lay down their weapons the roman soldiers hesitated but the jews promised most faithfully to keep their word
2775,5390-24512-0029.flac,exactly as the lord foretold there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers and is the property of the turkish nation
2776,5390-24512-0010.flac,yet the keener the suffering the more desperate the jews became their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge
2777,5390-24512-0006.flac,had not the jews prevented it if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend they cried
2778,5390-24512-0047.flac,nor for this purpose had god revealed his will to man some years ago in the coffin of an egyptian mummy a little jar of wheat was found for thousands of years it had lain there shut up in the dark
2779,5390-24512-0018.flac,as one by one their defences fell and the end drew near then food failed in the city men fought like demons in the streets for a tiny loaf of barley bread so frantic were the people with hunger
2780,5390-24512-0035.flac,yet although they heeded so little the true meaning of god's book they guarded its words more and more carefully and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict indeed my son an old teacher would say to his pupil
2781,5390-24512-0028.flac,so the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own they have indeed been led away captive into all nations
2782,5390-24512-0048.flac,while out in the fields the corn which had been sown had grown up and been reaped every year and men and women had been fed but this jar of corn was useless because it had been prevented from doing the work in the world for which it was created
2783,5390-24512-0043.flac,is the very centre of all the verses the letter a that is the hebrew letter which stands for a occurs forty two thousand three hundred seventy seven times the letter b thirty five thousand two hundred eighteen
2784,5390-24512-0005.flac,the roman government had no quarrel with him thine own nation hath delivered thee unto me
2785,5390-24512-0009.flac,and the history of those years is one long list of terrible risings and massacres while cities were ruined villages wrapped in flames and men women and children perished with hunger
2786,5390-24512-0034.flac,that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud explanation the law of moses is like salt but the talmud is balmy spice they would say
2787,5390-24512-0002.flac,had jesus of nazareth been willing to become their earthly king and to lead the nation against the romans the jews would probably have followed him to a man
2788,5390-24512-0004.flac,showed them the right attitude in which to regard the roman rule
2789,5390-24512-0003.flac,the saviour sought to heal it he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centyrion and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesars
2790,5390-24512-0044.flac,and so on not only this but every scribe was required to know from memory exactly how many letters of each kind there should be in his sheet before he began to write every sheet of parchment must contain an equal number of lines
2791,5390-24512-0015.flac,lifted up their hands to heaven as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery
2792,5390-24512-0012.flac,yet no sooner did a daring rebel or murderer gather a band of robbers around him and begin to kill and plunder than multitudes of jews cried the christ or messiah has come
2793,5390-24512-0046.flac,how tedious and meaningless such information appears of what value were all these details to spend all his days in learning such things as these could have no influence on a man's character nor make him a power for good in the world
2794,5390-24512-0021.flac,but a furious madness had possessed the people and they refused to yield josephus pleaded in vain he was not a christian but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people
2795,5390-24512-0039.flac,before writing any of the names of god you must wash your pen before writing his most sacred name you must wash your whole body if after your copy has itself been examined three corrections have to be made
2796,5390-24512-0008.flac,as their hero the nation started on their downward road as the story of the forty years which followed the saviour's crucifixion clearly shows for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke
2797,5390-24512-0011.flac,then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not matthew
2798,5390-24512-0001.flac,when our messiah comes he will be a great warrior they said he will utterly destroy all our enemies he will make jerusalem the greatest and richest city
2799,5390-24512-0023.flac,even a jew who had no faith in jesus christ could see plainly that the ancient power and glory of his nation had gone at last the end came the first wall fell
2800,5390-24512-0025.flac,pillars fell beams crumbled to ashes while round the altar of sacrifice the people of jerusalem lay heaped together slain in such numbers in the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream
2801,5390-30096-0027.flac,have you investigated the farm at all i looked up a real estate dealer living at millville and wrote him about the wegg farm he said if any one wanted the place very badly it might sell for three thousand dollars humph
2802,5390-30096-0007.flac,i just have to form a judgment and take me chances and when a poor devil goes wrong
2803,5390-30096-0033.flac,it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years
2804,5390-30096-0019.flac,and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that lent her face an indescribable charm everyone loved patsy doyle
2805,5390-30096-0014.flac,simple in his tastes modest and retiring lacking the education and refinements of polite society but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world the little man found his great enjoyment in the family circle
2806,5390-30096-0032.flac,you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift uncle john looked sober again any one live on the place major he inquired
2807,5390-30096-0001.flac,replied the major composedly it's a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you won't look after yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and ambitious young men who want a start in life oh uncle
2808,5390-30096-0024.flac,if you would let him have three thousand more so you took the farm and gave him the money i did sir perhaps i am to blame
2809,5390-30096-0016.flac,while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable he had never married
2810,5390-30096-0030.flac,beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farm's the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and we'll all have a glorious lazy time
2811,5390-30096-0010.flac,with one thing and another what of it retorted the little round faced millionaire leaning back in his chair and staring fixedly at the other that's what i employ you for now now gentlemen cried patsy earnestly
2812,5390-30096-0026.flac,he replied what became of the young man asked the girl he's a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving in automobile where is millville inquired uncle john thoughtfully somewhere at the north of the state i believe
2813,5390-30096-0011.flac,of his falling down and worshipping him john merrick was a multi millionaire to be sure but there were pelliating circumstances that almost excused him he had been so busily occupied in industry
2814,5390-30096-0017.flac,patricia was the apple of uncle john's eye and the one goddess enshrined in her doting father's heart glancing at her
2815,5390-30096-0008.flac,but some of them must succeed ventured patsy in a conciliatory tone some do said john merrick and that repays me for all my trouble
2816,5390-30096-0031.flac,and we can take mery along to do the cooking suggested patsy entering into the idea enthusiastically and eat in our shirt sleeves said uncle john with a glowing face and have a cow and some pigs cried the girl
2817,5390-30096-0004.flac,and it's the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of but i'm so glad cried patsy clapping her hands with a delighted gesture it's a splendid way to do good
2818,5390-30096-0028.flac,but his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at all patsy laughed poor uncle john she said the little man however was serious
2819,5390-30096-0002.flac,do you do that exclaimed miss patricia doyle who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both so the major says answered uncle john drily and it's true
2820,5390-30096-0000.flac,chapter one uncle john's farm how did i happen to own a farm asked uncle john interrupting his soup long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major doyle who sat opposite
2821,5390-30096-0012.flac,that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by accident than he promptly retired to give other fellows a chance and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity
2822,5390-30096-0029.flac,for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind years ago
2823,5390-30096-0021.flac,he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money quite right returned uncle john nodding but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale
2824,5390-30096-0013.flac,and the welfare and entertainment of his three nieces he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of esham marvin and company
2825,5390-30096-0025.flac,making five thousand in all well it's gone john and you've got the farm the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wegg and knocked out his patent i'm so sorry said patsy sympathetically
2826,5390-30096-0003.flac,asserted the other he's assisted three or four score young men to start in business in the last year to my certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars
2827,5390-30096-0023.flac,but he was decent about it after all his father had left him a little farm at millville he couldn't say what it was worth but there were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as security
2828,5390-30096-0015.flac,that he had been instrumental in founding being no longer absorbed in business he had come to detest its every detail and so allowed his bankers to care for his fortune and his brother in law to disperse his income
2829,5390-30096-0006.flac,and how can i tell whether they're deserving or not retorted major doyle fiercely do ye want me to become a sluth or engage detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy
2830,5390-30096-0009.flac,queried the major you mean all my trouble well and your money
2831,5390-30096-0022.flac,he was in a bad fix another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off it would take a lot of money to fight back three thousand at least
2832,5390-30096-0018.flac,in her plain muslin gown a stranger would be tempted to wonder why she was red haired freckled as a robin's egg pug nosed and wide mouthed but her blue eyes were beautiful
2833,5390-30096-0020.flac,and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face she was nearly seventeen years old not very tall and her form to speak charitably
2834,5390-30096-0005.flac,without capital you know many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder and many will never get it there in any event declared the major with a shake of his grizzled head
2835,5390-30102-0018.flac,and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery and as instruments to the end there were several people available who could be of use to her mc nutt the agent who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell old hucks and his wife
2836,5390-30102-0013.flac,louise set to work to tabulate the information she had received thus far noting the element of mystery each fact evolved first captain wegg must have been a rich man in order to build this house
2837,5390-30102-0020.flac,when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs louise said to him i've been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness that's true he replied
2838,5390-30102-0014.flac,secondly the captain a surly and silent man had brought hither perhaps by force a young woman as his wife who was so unhappy that she pined away and died who was this woman
2839,5390-30102-0024.flac,buckling a strap unmoved who told ye i were once a seafarin man i guessed it as he appeared indisposed to say more on the subject she asked did you sail with captain wegg partly miss dan's already now
2840,5390-30102-0029.flac,do you know where the thompsons live inquired uncle john no wo dan that was the best thing the nag did he knew how to woe thomas called uncle john turning in his seat
2841,5390-30102-0002.flac,and men usually admired her graceful figure and her piquant pretty face with its crown of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression there was a rumor that she was engaged to be married to arthur weldon
2842,5390-30102-0009.flac,the plain folks around millville might speculate listlessly upon the queer duins at the farm and never get anywhere near the truth indeed the strange occurrences she had just heard
2843,5390-30102-0011.flac,it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at millville and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detective
2844,5390-30102-0005.flac,louise merrick was a clever girl possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of others her apparent shallowness was a blind of the same character as her assumed graciousness
2845,5390-30102-0022.flac,when patsy and beth will be able to meet her that's a good idea louise i was wondering what i'd do this morning tell old hucks to get the nag harnessed the girl ran eagerly upon her errand
2846,5390-30102-0026.flac,dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle john stood awaiting his niece
2847,5390-30102-0001.flac,let a mere butterfly existence her two cousins frankly agreed that louise was shallow insincere and inclined to be affected but of the three girls
2848,5390-30102-0023.flac,but he turned without a word to harness the horse louise stood watching him your fingers are quite nimble thomas considering the fact that you were once a sailor she said but sailors have to be nimble miss he returned
2849,5390-30102-0021.flac,can't we drive over to thompson's this morning uncle beth and patsy have planned a tramp to the lake and a row after water lilies then let us make our call together we can invite the girl to come here and spend a day with us
2850,5390-30102-0003.flac,a young man of position in the city but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing one of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage when away from her frivolous mother
2851,5390-30102-0028.flac,or why some one don't knock him on the head dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane
2852,5390-30102-0015.flac,what had rendered her so unhappy and despairing thirdly the captain's only friend had been a crazy man named will thompson was he crazy before the captain's death or had he become crazed at that time
2853,5390-30102-0000.flac,chapter seven louise scents a mystery louise merrick was the eldest of uncle john's nieces having just passed her eighteenth birthday
2854,5390-30102-0027.flac,i understand dan well i don't returned uncle john in his whimsical way as he mounted to the seat beside her i don't understand how he's happened to live since the landing of columbus or what he's good for
2855,5390-30102-0007.flac,and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin uncle john thought he knew her too and was very proud of his eldest niece in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly admirable
2856,5390-30102-0030.flac,and at the summons old hucks came from the barn and approached them how do you get to miss thompson's place miss ethels another fleeting expression of surprise yes we're going over to thank her for her kindness to us
2857,5390-30102-0004.flac,and the inconsequent home environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency one thing was indisputable however
2858,5390-30102-0016.flac,the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word why unless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible in the fifth place there was old hucks and his blind wife to be considered
2859,5390-30102-0025.flac,don't jerk the bit for his mouth's tender and it makes him balky if he balks jest let him rest a time and then speak to him dan ain't vicious he's jest ornery she climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins
2860,5390-30102-0017.flac,what did they know about their old master's secret history what tragic memories lurked beneath the man's perpetual smile and the woman's composed and sightless face surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity
2861,5390-30102-0019.flac,and ethel thompson the school teacher there might be others but one or another of these four must know the truth and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once
2862,5390-30102-0012.flac,an occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful warned however by the rebuff she had met with from uncle john the girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed investigation to any one for the present
2863,5390-30102-0031.flac,thompson's stammered hucks glancing up at them with his bright elusive smile well we're going anyhow growled mister merrick
2864,5390-30102-0006.flac,and while she would have been more lovable without any pretence or sham she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was patsy and beth thought they knew her
2865,5390-30102-0008.flac,an extensive course of light literature not void of detective stories had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to scent a mystery in the history of captain wegg
2866,5390-30102-0010.flac,were nearly forgotten in the community and soon would be forgotten altogether unless the quick ear of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored at first she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking
2867,1743-142912-0021.flac,turning away toward the green meadows instead peter didn't wait for scrapper to return
2868,1743-142912-0029.flac,cast off snake suits before peter could say another word cresty had flown away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch and then towards jenny wren's house
2869,1743-142912-0033.flac,didn't i peter rabbit didn't i didn't i you certainly did jenny you certainly did and i'm sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing but i just didn't know who else to go to
2870,1743-142912-0005.flac,and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw
2871,1743-142912-0023.flac,every way but the right way look up over your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice
2872,1743-142912-0003.flac,at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices
2873,1743-142912-0030.flac,he just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny wren could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered lipperty lipperty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home
2874,1743-142912-0031.flac,jenny called peter jenny wren jenny wren no one answered him he could hear mister wren singing in another tree but he couldn't see him jenny jenny wren jenny wren called peter again
2875,1743-142912-0009.flac,all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him
2876,1743-142912-0014.flac,it reminded peter that he had often heard scrapper called the bee martin and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter
2877,1743-142912-0036.flac,he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors
2878,1743-142912-0034.flac,go to for what snapped jenny wren what is it you've come to me for snakeskins replied peter snake skins snakeskins shrieked jenny wren
2879,1743-142912-0027.flac,if in youre roaming about you run across an old castoff suit of mister blacksnake or any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said cresty  a
2880,1743-142912-0019.flac,but if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrapper's bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught the fly and it had tasted good
2881,1743-142912-0015.flac,there wouldn't be any honey if i did
2882,1743-142912-0013.flac,and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebeks did when he caught a fly but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up
2883,1743-142912-0010.flac,scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing
2884,1743-142912-0006.flac,a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat
2885,1743-142912-0016.flac,those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that don't
2886,1743-142912-0024.flac,it was cresty the great crested fly catcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender
2887,1743-142912-0020.flac,are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him
2888,1743-142912-0004.flac,of course peter couldn't be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him
2889,1743-142912-0017.flac,i am one of farmer brown's best friends if he did but know it you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have i'd like to know who it is
2890,1743-142912-0035.flac,you don't understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to know is why should cresty the fly catcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family
2891,1743-142912-0018.flac,there's a fly way over there beyond the old apple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away
2892,1743-142912-0028.flac,a what stammered peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied cresty somewhat impatiently now don't forget peter i've got to go house hunting but you'll find me there or hereabouts if it happens that you find one of those
2893,1743-142912-0032.flac,this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping
2894,1743-142912-0025.flac,his throat and breast were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking
2895,1743-142912-0002.flac,the rest of us always feels safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now
2896,1743-142912-0001.flac,he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of chebecs did you say your fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way that is what i said replied chebec he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know
2897,1743-142912-0022.flac,just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard some one called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way
2898,1743-142912-0007.flac,he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was
2899,1743-142912-0011.flac,peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the fly catchers there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill
2900,1743-142912-0012.flac,scrapper's slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air
2901,1743-142912-0026.flac,you seem to be in a hurry so don't let me detain you peter said cresty before peter could find his tongue i just want to ask one little favor of you what is it asked peter who
2902,1743-142912-0000.flac,and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear
2903,1743-142912-0008.flac,he wasn't afraid and he intended that everybody should know it especially redtail it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling redtail a robber and every other bad name he could think of
2904,1743-142914-0005.flac,he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled
2905,1743-142914-0000.flac,he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go
2906,1743-142914-0032.flac,they looked so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but for missus teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps missus teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably
2907,1743-142914-0016.flac,for the first time peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes exclaimed peter
2908,1743-142914-0015.flac,then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat where that longbill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole
2909,1743-142914-0020.flac,and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in asked peter longbill chuckled
2910,1743-142914-0023.flac,that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes it all it's wonderful sighed peter i don't suppose any one else can find hidden worms that way my cousin jack snipe can replied longbill promptly
2911,1743-142914-0001.flac,i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was one of the first birds to arrive and i've neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time
2912,1743-142914-0018.flac,peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface
2913,1743-142914-0017.flac,and was there a worm in every one asked peter his eyes very wide with interest longbill nodded
2914,1743-142914-0034.flac,my he exclaimed i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me said he i'm so thankful i didn't i don't see how you dare to lay them in the open like this
2915,1743-142914-0021.flac,longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all that's the way i get them said he
2916,1743-142914-0010.flac,certainly i'll excuse you replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be that longbill was making such a good meal of but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground
2917,1743-142914-0025.flac,now i must be running along i'm ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get so peter said good bye and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool
2918,1743-142914-0024.flac,he feeds the same way i do only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before
2919,1743-142914-0008.flac,i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger
2920,1743-142914-0003.flac,bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground was soft in places quite muddy peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly
2921,1743-142914-0031.flac,missus teeter stood up and stepped aside then peeter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for a lining four white eggs with big dark blotches on them
2922,1743-142914-0007.flac,i didn't mean to scare him apologized peter i really didn't mean to do you think he was really very much scared
2923,1743-142914-0012.flac,he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up
2924,1743-142914-0002.flac,off he started lipperty lipperty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows
2925,1743-142914-0006.flac,he scared me for a second then you 're even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but longbill didn't peter turned quickly there was missus woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass
2926,1743-142914-0026.flac,there was a little pebbly beach running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long slender bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black
2927,1743-142914-0004.flac,from right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head
2928,1743-142914-0033.flac,it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it he wouldn't have known she was there
2929,1743-142914-0028.flac,it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peter's peter greeted him joyously
2930,1743-142914-0022.flac,i think there is one right under my feet now watch me get him longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this
2931,1743-142914-0014.flac,his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly longbill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length
2932,1743-142914-0030.flac,just then missus teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start
2933,1743-142914-0019.flac,while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for anyone to know that they were there
2934,1743-142914-0029.flac,before peeter could say another word teeter came running towards him and it was plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something don't move peeter rabbit don't move he cried why not demanded peeter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move
2935,1743-142914-0009.flac,i'm glad it is no one but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it you'll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites
2936,1743-142914-0027.flac,every few steps he would stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a sea saw
2937,1743-142914-0013.flac,his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it was his head that made him look queer
2938,1743-142914-0011.flac,longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion peter had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow
2939,1743-142913-0025.flac,tommy tit the chickadee sometimes uses an old house then again he and missus chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one
2940,1743-142913-0023.flac,winsome bluebirds stupid snapped jenny wren peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and skimmer the tree swallow added jenny that's so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter
2941,1743-142913-0015.flac,then as peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest said she why they want it goodness knows but
2942,1743-142913-0019.flac,where are your eyes peter did you ever see a flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didn't wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look
2943,1743-142913-0024.flac,i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny wren nodded yank yank the nuthatch uses an old house i'm told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she
2944,1743-142913-0029.flac,jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well what is it now she demanded have you got two homes asked peter good gracious no exclaimed jenny
2945,1743-142913-0009.flac,it is so quiet and restful that i love it missus pwee and i are very retiring we do not like too many near neighbours you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while will you asked peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch
2946,1743-142913-0003.flac,it didn't take peter long to find peewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw peewee fly out and make the same kind of little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies
2947,1743-142913-0005.flac,but he wasn't sad as peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger than his cousin chebek but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail
2948,1743-142913-0004.flac,it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone peewee pee wee pee wee
2949,1743-142913-0022.flac,the older it is the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us
2950,1743-142913-0011.flac,that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly loved to destroy
2951,1743-142913-0001.flac,he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying pee wee pee wee pee wee peter chuckled happily
2952,1743-142913-0017.flac,and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugh by the way where does cresty build asked peter
2953,1743-142913-0026.flac,then there are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl peter looked surprised i didn't suppose they nested in holes an trees he exclaimed they certainly do more's the pity snapped jenny
2954,1743-142913-0014.flac,jenny wren was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way an that way in that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded
2955,1743-142913-0010.flac,come as often as you like replied pewee the oftener the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the flycatcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him
2956,1743-142913-0018.flac,in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite as surprised as he felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious know exclaimed jenny wren
2957,1743-142913-0021.flac,i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in
2958,1743-142913-0008.flac,that is something i don't often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call you wood peewee peewee chuckled happily
2959,1743-142913-0020.flac,there is downy the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute that's good i like to see that it means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses
2960,1743-142913-0006.flac,the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing two whitish bars and he noticed that peewee's wings were longer than his tail which wasn't the case with chebec
2961,1743-142913-0000.flac,with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old briar patch on his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard
2962,1743-142913-0007.flac,but no one could ever mistake peewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over aren't you here early asked peter peewee nodded
2963,1743-142913-0012.flac,but most of all peter thought about that queer request of cresty's and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mister blacksnake
2964,1743-142913-0016.flac,perhaps they think it will scare robbers away as for me i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that cresty and his wife are a handsome couple
2965,1743-142913-0028.flac,spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine i've talked quite enough for one morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him
2966,1743-142913-0013.flac,it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mister son had kicked his bedclothes off
2967,1743-142913-0030.flac,one is all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mister wren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole an another tree it seems to me that he has carried enough in there to build two or three nests
2968,1743-142913-0027.flac,it would be a good thing for the rest of us if they didn't nest at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them killy always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year
2969,1743-142913-0002.flac,he usually is one of the last of the flycatcher family to arrive i didn't expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early
2970,8238-274553-0060.flac,upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement
2971,8238-274553-0061.flac,i have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette
2972,8238-274553-0069.flac,he now explained the mystery
2973,8238-274553-0066.flac,to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron
2974,8238-274553-0073.flac,and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit upon this hint he proceeded
2975,8238-274553-0070.flac,and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately
2976,8238-274553-0071.flac,where there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in herman's way
2977,8238-274553-0068.flac,he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my surprise
2978,8238-274553-0058.flac,will hand you this note i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers in the event of your declining this request
2979,8238-274553-0057.flac,although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling
2980,8238-274553-0074.flac,herman would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello
2981,8238-274553-0056.flac,per constructionem
2982,8238-274553-0055.flac,from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world
2983,8238-274553-0067.flac,he seemed to receive herman's amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duelli lexcripta et non
2984,8238-274553-0063.flac,to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation with sentiments of profound respect your most obedient servant von jung
2985,8238-274553-0072.flac,two or three weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation
2986,8238-274553-0065.flac,et per se having finished reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself
2987,8238-274553-0064.flac,herman commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self complacency
2988,8238-274553-0062.flac,the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient i am assured
2989,8238-274553-0059.flac,having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which i carried to herman sir through our common friend mister p i have received your note of this evening
2990,8238-274553-0023.flac,lay like an incubus upon the university
2991,8238-274553-0007.flac,that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung then of no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any dada personally afforded
2992,8238-274553-0014.flac,ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practical the old bull dog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused the ghost of heraclitis or the whig of the emeritus professor of theology
2993,8238-274553-0040.flac,for a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched
2994,8238-274553-0021.flac,my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household
2995,8238-274553-0002.flac,threw a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental confirmation in later days this insight grew more clear
2996,8238-274553-0012.flac,the study and the business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue
2997,8238-274553-0031.flac,but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he rode to the death to ritzner
2998,8238-274553-0041.flac,the language you have thought proper to employ
2999,8238-274553-0019.flac,the adroitness too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created
3000,8238-274553-0042.flac,in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman
3001,8238-274553-0030.flac,and i believe for some logical talent as a duellist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly
3002,8238-274553-0049.flac,and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar character
3003,8238-274553-0037.flac,then excessively read then dropping his pocket handkerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no one else at the table
3004,8238-274553-0018.flac,which upon each such failure of his praiseworthy endeavours would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions
3005,8238-274553-0050.flac,after a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his bookshelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello and entertained me for a long time
3006,8238-274553-0017.flac,in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of al mammatter
3007,8238-274553-0051.flac,the theatre of honour by favin
3008,8238-274553-0033.flac,i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r and giving his reasons in detail
3009,8238-274553-0047.flac,striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and ritzner took their departure
3010,8238-274553-0022.flac,with the memory of the baron ritzner von jung
3011,8238-274553-0048.flac,as herman went out the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business
3012,8238-274553-0013.flac,i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself
3013,8238-274553-0024.flac,during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening
3014,8238-274553-0010.flac,after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features conveying so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity
3015,8238-274553-0034.flac,to these the baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer
3016,8238-274553-0045.flac,this being done there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult
3017,8238-274553-0032.flac,ever upon the lookout for the grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification of this however i was not aware
3018,8238-274553-0039.flac,for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadaverously white
3019,8238-274553-0046.flac,while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite herman
3020,8238-274553-0006.flac,manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable
3021,8238-274553-0038.flac,it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood erect
3022,8238-274553-0036.flac,i would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman as hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were turned upon the baron
3023,8238-274553-0027.flac,a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended and especially to hold the entire fan farinade of dueling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves
3024,8238-274553-0011.flac,solemnity and repose it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification
3025,8238-274553-0053.flac,with a fine margin and bound by derome
3026,8238-274553-0044.flac,you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavour to consider for an instant
3027,8238-274553-0026.flac,in impressiveness and an affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even myself who well knew him to be at heart
3028,8238-274553-0028.flac,looking around me during a pause in the baron's discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of colridge
3029,8238-274553-0004.flac,no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted
3030,8238-274553-0035.flac,your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member
3031,8238-274553-0009.flac,he was by no means a handsome man perhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub
3032,8238-274553-0003.flac,which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty fifth of june i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world
3033,8238-274553-0008.flac,he might have been fifteen or fifty
3034,8238-274553-0029.flac,except perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking
3035,8238-274553-0000.flac,i'll have none of them ned knoles the baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family every member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend
3036,8238-274553-0054.flac,and having the quaint title dueli lexscripta et non
3037,8238-274553-0015.flac,this too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him

3039,8238-274553-0020.flac,from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual mystific escape
3040,8238-274553-0001.flac,was more or less remarkable for talent of some description the majority for that species of grotesquere in conception of which tiqh a scion of the house has given a vivid
3041,8238-274553-0005.flac,but letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits
3042,8238-274553-0016.flac,lay in that consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self possession
3043,8238-274553-0025.flac,and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor an eloquence
3044,8238-274553-0043.flac,is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct
3045,8238-283452-0034.flac,but the spook that provides a joke on his host or on himself is a yankee in origin and development the dry humor the comic sense of the incongruous the willingness to laugh at himself as at others
3046,8238-283452-0017.flac,many americans there are to day who would court being haunted by the captain and crew of richard middleton's ghost ship that landed in a turnip field and dispensed drink till they demoralized the denizens of village and graveyard alike
3047,8238-283452-0040.flac,till the phantom couple take aliking to each other and decide to let the living bury their dead this is suggestive of brander matthew's earlier and cleverer story of a spectral courtship in the rival ghosts
3048,8238-283452-0022.flac,the modern humorous ghost saterizes everything from the old fashioned specter he's very fond of taking pot shots at him to the latest psychic manifestations
3049,8238-283452-0015.flac,he knows that there's no weapon no threat in horror to be compared with ridicule think what a solemn creature the gothic ghost was
3050,8238-283452-0047.flac,the field is still comparatively limited but a number of americans have done distinctive work in it the spectr now wears motley instead of a shroud
3051,8238-283452-0027.flac,where the suitor on the moonlit porch attempting to tell his fair one that he dotes on her sees the ghost of her ferocious uncle who isn't dead
3052,8238-283452-0038.flac,of the early specimens of the really amusing ghost that is an actual revenen is the ghost baby in blackwoods which shows originality and humor yet is too diffuse for printing here
3053,8238-283452-0026.flac,and demonstrate a new kind of apparition the ghost story of to day gives you spinal sensations with a difference as in the immortal transferred ghost by fred r stockton
3054,8238-283452-0039.flac,in that we have a conventional young bachelor engaged to a charming girl who is entangled in social complications and made to suffer mental torment because without his consent
3055,8238-283452-0032.flac,and compromised on a few stately ejaculations as being safely phantasmal speaking parts but compare that usage with the rude freedom of some modern spooks
3056,8238-283452-0041.flac,mediaeval and later literature give us many instances of love affair or marriage between one spirit and one mortal
3057,8238-283452-0035.flac,and are preserved in their true flavor i don't assert of course

3059,8238-283452-0024.flac,and uses the old thrills only to show what dead batteries they come from his really electrical effects are his own inventions he needs no dungeon keeps and monkish cells to play about in not he
3060,8238-283452-0028.flac,kicking his heels against the railing and hears his admonition that he'd better hurry up as the live uncle is coming in sight
3061,8238-283452-0031.flac,and ghosts like kings in drama were of a dignity and must preserve it in their speech or perhaps the authors were doubtful as to the dialogue of shades
3062,8238-283452-0020.flac,a ghost moreover that towered and swelled at every hackneyed phrase till finally he filled the room and burst after the young man proposed to his admired one and made subsequent remarks
3063,8238-283452-0023.flac,he laughs at ghosts that aren't experts in efficiency haunting and he has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of spectres he loves to shake the lugubrious terrors of the past before you
3064,8238-283452-0042.flac,show the diversity of the english humor as associated with apparitions and are entertaining in themselves the canterville ghost by oscar wilde is one of his best short stories
3065,8238-283452-0046.flac,we feel downright neighborly toward such spectres as the futile last ghost nelson lloyd evokes for us as we appreciate the satire of rose o'nell's sophisticated wraith
3066,8238-283452-0045.flac,john kendrick bangs has made the darker regions seem comfortable and homelike for us and has created ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward to being one or more
3067,8238-283452-0037.flac,there are various english stories of whimsical haunting some of actual spooks and some of the hoax type hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in british as in american literature
3068,8238-283452-0021.flac,ghosts not only have appallingly long memories but they possess a mean advantage over the living in that they have once been mortal
3069,8238-283452-0033.flac,think of having always and always to speak a dead language the humorous ghost is not only modern but he is distinctively american there are ghosts of all nationalities naturally
3070,8238-283452-0043.flac,this travesty on the conventional traditions of the wraith is preposterously delightful one of the cleverest ghost stories in our language zangwell has written engagingly of spooks
3071,8238-283452-0036.flac,the french and english selections in this volume are sufficient to prove the contrary
3072,8238-283452-0044.flac,frank r stocton gave his to funny spooks with a riotous and laughing pen the spirit in the transferred ghost is impudently deathless and has called up a train of subsequent haunters
3073,8238-283452-0016.flac,how little originality and initiative he showed and how dependent he was on his own atmosphere for thrills his sole appeal was to the spinal column the ghost of to day touches the funny bone as well
3074,8238-283452-0025.flac,he demands no rag nor bone nor clank of chain of his old equipment to start on his career he can start up a moving picture show of his own as in ruth mc kenry stuart's the haunted photograph
3075,8238-283452-0014.flac,the up to date ghost keeps his skeleton in a garage or some place where it is cleaned and oiled and kept in good working order the modern wraith has sold his sheet to the old clothes man and dresses as in life
3076,8238-283452-0019.flac,his jest is likely to have more than one point to it and he can haunt so insidiously can make himself so at home in his host's study or bedroom that a man actually welcomes a chat with him
3077,8238-283452-0030.flac,in the older fiction and drama apparitions spoke seldom
3078,8238-283452-0018.flac,after that show of spirits the turnips in that field tasted of rum long after the ghost ship had sailed away into the blue the modern spook is possessed not only of humor but of a caustic satire as well
3079,8238-283452-0009.flac,and indulging in greater freedom a ghost can call his shade his own now and exhibit any mood he pleases even young female wraiths demanding latch keys refuse to obey the frowning face of the clock
3080,8238-283452-0011.flac,manifestly death has compensations not connected with the consolations of religion the marvel is that apparitions were so long in realizing their possibilities in improving their advantages
3081,8238-283452-0010.flac,to make the ghost of missus grundy turn a shade paler in horror nowadays haunters have more fun and freedom than the haunted in fact it's money in one's pocket these days to be dead for ghosts have no rent problems
3082,8238-283452-0001.flac,and insisted on a proper show of respectful fear on the part of those whom they honoured by haunting a mortal was expected to rise when a ghost entered the room and in case he was slow about it
3083,8238-283452-0013.flac,at best a revenan could only rattle a rusty skeleton or shake a mouldy shroud or clank a chain but as mortals cowered before his demonstrations he didn't worry
3084,8238-283452-0006.flac,the number of ghost children of any or all types is small proportionately perhaps because it seems an unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances
3085,8238-283452-0004.flac,while the feminine can be seen through by another woman and thus disarmed the majority of the comic apparitions curiously enough are masculine you don't often find women wrathed in smiles
3086,8238-283452-0007.flac,there are a few instances as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later but very few ancient ghosts were a long faced lot
3087,8238-283452-0005.flac,and have chivalrously spared the gentler shades and there are very few funny child ghosts you might almost say none in comparison with the number of grown ups
3088,8238-283452-0012.flac,the specters in classic and mediaeval literature were malarial vaporous beings without energy to do anything but threaten
3089,8238-283452-0008.flac,since any living person however senile would be thought juvenile compared with a timeless spook but in these days of individualism and radical liberalism spooks as well as mortals are expanding their personalities
3090,8238-283452-0002.flac,his spine gave notice of what etiquette demanded in the event of outdoor apparition if a man failed to bare his head in awe the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness
3091,8238-283452-0000.flac,introduction the humorous ghost is distinctly a modern character in early literature wraiths took themselves very seriously
3092,8238-283452-0003.flac,in that her locks being long and pinned up are less easily moved which may explain the fact if it be a fact that in fiction women have shown themselves more self possessed

3112,5456-24741-0008.flac,corollary the mind is able to regard as present external bodies by which the human body has once been affected even though they be no longer in existence or present
3113,5456-24741-0005.flac,it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing
3114,5456-24741-0001.flac,proof all the modes in which any given body is affected
3115,5456-24741-0018.flac,whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes
3116,5456-24741-0014.flac,which associations arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications affections of the human body i say first it is an association of those ideas only
3117,5456-24741-0000.flac,the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies
3118,5456-24741-0023.flac,the human body itself and as actually existing therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body
3119,5456-24741-0015.flac,ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking
3120,5456-24741-0017.flac,in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas
3121,5456-24741-0007.flac,will regard the external body as actually existing
3122,5456-24741-0016.flac,those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies i say secondly
3123,5456-24741-0012.flac,the modifications of the human body of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us we will call the images of things tthough they do not recall the figure of things when the mind regards bodies in this fashion we say that it imagines
3124,5456-24741-0020.flac,a roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it
3125,5456-24741-0013.flac,looked at in themselves do not contain error the mind does not err in the mere act of imagining but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea
3126,5456-24741-0003.flac,therefore the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body
3127,5456-24741-0009.flac,by which the human body has once been affected be no longer in existence the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated
3128,5456-24741-0006.flac,in other words it will have the idea which does not exclude but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body
3129,5456-24741-0011.flac,the latter indicates rather the disposition of paul's body than the nature of peter and therefore while this disposition of paul's body lasts paul's mind will regard peter as present to itself even though he no longer exists further to retain the usual phraseology
3130,5456-24741-0022.flac,or the human mind perceives those modifications
3131,5456-24741-0021.flac,that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit
3132,5456-24741-0010.flac,note we thus see how it comes about
3133,5456-24741-0002.flac,wherefore their idea also necessarily
3134,5456-24741-0024.flac,following in god in the same manner and being referred to god in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the human body proof
3135,5456-24741-0019.flac,and hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of one thing should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum an apple
3136,5456-24741-0004.flac,hence it follows first that the human mind perceives the nature of a variety of bodies together with the nature of its own
3137,5456-62043-0025.flac,i heard the bell and the pilot's hail what's your prize for wood a youthful voice on the shore answered three and a quarter damn it ejaculated the captain
3138,5456-62043-0016.flac,thompson i say we'd better take three or four cords at the next woodyard it can't be more than six miles from here two aces and a bragger with the age
3139,5456-62043-0023.flac,they wanted to learn the game at two o'clock the captain asked the mate how we were getting on oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising
3140,5456-62043-0027.flac,was the reply of the youthful salesman the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game the pilots here changed places when did they sleep wood taken in
3141,5456-62043-0019.flac,three and a quarter but soon again became interested in the game from my upper berth there were no staterooms then i could observe the movements of the players
3142,5456-62043-0020.flac,the latter personages took it turned and turn about steering and playing brag one of them almost invariably winning while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their anties they were anxious to learn the game
3143,5456-62043-0004.flac,and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of natches on the next day our wood was getting low and night coming on the pilot on duty above the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the captain who went it strong on three kings
3144,5456-62043-0013.flac,in about half an hour we felt the caravan commenced paddling again supper was over
3145,5456-62043-0033.flac,and the captain hailed hallo the woodyard hallo yourself answered a squeaking female voice which came from a woman with a petticoat over her shoulders in place of a shawl what's the price of wood
3146,5456-62043-0001.flac,she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera her regular trips from new orleans to natches were usually made and from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable
3147,5456-62043-0018.flac,i can't very well leave the game now it's getting right warm this pilot's beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard
3148,5456-62043-0014.flac,situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate
3149,5456-62043-0010.flac,what's the odd quarter for i should like to know you only charged me three as i went down why captan drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of alleer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold
3150,5456-62043-0024.flac,this wood seems rather better than that we took in yellow faces but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask im what's the price of wood up here i've got you again
3151,5456-62043-0037.flac,accompanied by the same leer of the same yellow countenance why darn' it all captain there is but three or four cords left and since it's you i don't care if i do let you have it for three as you're a good customer
3152,5456-62043-0031.flac,the pilot with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game and said in an undertone forty apiece for you and i and james the other pilot is not bad for one night i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs
3153,5456-62043-0021.flac,and they did learn it once in a while indeed seeing they had two aces and a bragger they would venture a bed of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot
3154,5456-62043-0038.flac,and turned in to take some rest the fact became apparent the reader will probably have discovered it some time since
3155,5456-62043-0036.flac,out crept from the cottage the veritable faded hat copperas colored pants yellow countenance and two weeks beard we had seen the night before
3156,5456-62043-0008.flac,with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his arm pits a pair of coppers coloured lindsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black
3157,5456-62043-0032.flac,there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taking in more than sixty yards so i was disappointed in my expectation we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood the banks being invisible from the middle of the river there it is exclaimed the captain stop her
3158,5456-62043-0026.flac,the strangers suffering some at the same time three and a quarter again are we never to get to a cheaper country deal sir if you please better luck next time the other pilot's voice was again heard on deck how much have you only about ten cords sir
3159,5456-62043-0034.flac,i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petticoat
3160,5456-62043-0017.flac,the game went on and the paddles kept moving at eleven o'clock it was reported to the captain that we were nearing the woodyard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty head her in shore then and take in six cords if it's good see to it thompson
3161,5456-62043-0030.flac,it appears the two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost one hundred and twenty dollars the captain as he rose to see about taking in some goodwood which he felt sure of obtaining now that he had got above the level country winked at his opponent
3162,5456-62043-0028.flac,the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned the brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation
3163,5456-62043-0006.flac,which he said was situated right round yonder point but muttered the captain i don't much like to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there's no other chance
3164,5456-62043-0029.flac,the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning
3165,5456-62043-0002.flac,a voyage from new orleans to vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the falls luevelle i have never learned if she did
3166,5456-62043-0003.flac,she must have had a time of it it was my fate to take passage in this boat the captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag we had been out a little more than five days
3167,5456-62043-0015.flac,how does that wood burn inquired the captain of the mate who was looking on at the game tisn't of much account i reckon answered the mate it's cottonwood and most of its green at that well thompson three aces again stranger
3168,5456-62043-0009.flac,and a pipe in his mouth casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening our spring line answered why captain we must charge you three and a quarter this time the devil replied the captain
3169,5456-62043-0000.flac,a bully boat and a brag captain a story of steamboat life on the mississippi by sal smith does any one remember the caravan she was what would now be considered a slow boat then eighteen twenty seven
3170,5456-62043-0007.flac,and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized woodpile hallo colonel how d' ye sall your wood this time a yellow faced old gentleman
3171,5456-62043-0012.flac,and there's no other woodyard for nine miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fuel why well well interrupted the captain we'll take a few cords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of brag
3172,5456-62043-0035.flac,and now you know it three and the devil broke in the captain what have you raised on your wood too i'll give you three and not a cent more well replied the petticoat here comes the old man they'll talk to you and sure enough
3173,5456-62043-0005.flac,sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck
3174,5456-62043-0011.flac,woods ris since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop goin down

3254,1088-134315-0000.flac,as you know and as i have given you proof i have the greatest admiration in the world for one whose work for humanity has won such universal recognition i hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person
3255,1088-134315-0015.flac,t x he went on somewhat iracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
3256,1088-134315-0051.flac,i fairly get the creeps sitting here hour after hour it's that door that gives me the hump she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood that's mister kara's wine cellar nobody's been in it but him
3257,1088-134315-0043.flac,fisher went back to the library the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up i am afraid miss holland i've got myself into very serious trouble what is that fisher asked the girl
3258,1088-134315-0048.flac,the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid serving maid and housekeeper in one miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon
3259,1088-134315-0022.flac,he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street keep my fire going put all my private letters in my bedroom and see that miss holland has her lunch fisher followed him to his car wrapped the fur rug about his legs
3260,1088-134315-0003.flac,i shall feel that his trip which has cost me a large sum of money will not have been wasted i am dear mister meredith yours very sincerely remington kara
3261,1088-134315-0031.flac,there was a little knob for the purpose and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself rum cove he said again and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up left the room closing the door softly behind him
3262,1088-134315-0049.flac,but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her she heard the soft thud of the front door closing and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street she watched fisher until he was out of sight
3263,1088-134315-0036.flac,and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
3264,1088-134318-0006.flac,had t x returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions
3265,1088-134318-0002.flac,to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
3266,1088-134318-0003.flac,to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
3267,1088-134318-0008.flac,yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock
3268,1088-134318-0009.flac,bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tessellated hallway
3269,1088-134318-0014.flac,he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
3270,1088-134318-0013.flac,then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
3271,1088-134318-0000.flac,chapter twelve kara lay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
3272,1088-134318-0020.flac,at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
3273,1088-134318-0010.flac,muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
3274,1088-134318-0004.flac,he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
3275,1088-134318-0016.flac,no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
3276,1088-134318-0005.flac,he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins s twitching and struggling on the gallows at pazara and
3277,1088-134318-0001.flac,it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasants cabin on the hillside outside durazo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kara's whim all that life held for a man
3278,1088-134318-0015.flac,fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
3279,1088-134318-0007.flac,kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
3280,1088-134318-0018.flac,damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
3281,1088-134318-0017.flac,and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitors so genial i suppose your cheque will be honored all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
3282,1088-134318-0021.flac,until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
3283,1088-134318-0011.flac,yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
3284,1088-134318-0019.flac,always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you
3285,1088-134318-0012.flac,yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor
3286,1088-129236-0026.flac,a midnight bell a passing groan these are the sounds we feed upon behold there in the wood the fine madman he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights he dilates he is twice a man
3287,1088-129236-0027.flac,he walks with arms akimbo he soliloquizes he accosts the grass and the trees he feels the blood of the violet the clover and the lily in his veins and he talks with the brook that wets his foot
3288,1088-129236-0030.flac,into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world so only it have the countenance of the beloved object in giving him to another it still more gives him to himself
3289,1088-129236-0029.flac,the like force has the passion over all his nature it expands the sentiment it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart
3290,1088-129236-0028.flac,the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion who cannot write well under any other circumstances
3291,1088-129236-0025.flac,the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes
3292,1088-129236-0018.flac,that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances
3293,1088-129236-0011.flac,dwell care and canker and fear with thought with the ideal is immortal hilarity the rose of joy round it all the muses sing but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of to day and yesterday
3294,1088-129236-0016.flac,for persons are love's world and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature aught derogatory to the social instincts
3295,1088-129236-0007.flac,glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women upon the universal heart of all and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames
3296,1088-129236-0015.flac,he holds her books to help her and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough but one alone distances him
3297,1088-129236-0008.flac,only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muse's aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden
3298,1088-129236-0017.flac,yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience
3299,1088-129236-0023.flac,thy loving heart in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love
3300,1088-129236-0003.flac,establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society the natural association of the sentiment of love with the hayday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience
3301,1088-129236-0002.flac,unites him to his race pledges him to the domestic and civic relations carries him with new sympathy into nature enhances the power of the senses opens the imagination adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes
3302,1088-129236-0012.flac,the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment
3303,1088-129236-0010.flac,which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name
3304,1088-129236-0013.flac,and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life like any passage betraying affection between two parties perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion and we are no longer strangers
3305,1088-129236-0014.flac,it is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic the rude village boy teases the girls about the schoolhouse door but to day he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel
3306,1088-129236-0004.flac,one must not be too old the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom
3307,1088-129236-0000.flac,every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments each of its joys ripens into a new want nature uncontainable flowing forelooking
3308,1088-129236-0001.flac,in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one which is the enchantiment of human life
3309,1088-129236-0020.flac,the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory
3310,1088-129236-0024.flac,all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on
3311,1088-129236-0006.flac,for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old
3312,1088-129236-0005.flac,and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable censors i shall appeal to my seniors
3313,1088-129236-0022.flac,the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enamelled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone where'er thou art
3314,1088-129236-0021.flac,when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends though best and purest can give him for the figures the motions
3315,1088-129236-0009.flac,and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured
3316,1088-129236-0019.flac,no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain which created all things anew which was the dawn in him of music poetry and art which made the face of nature radiant with purple light
3317,3240-131232-0002.flac,so then that the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different origins from different worlds perhaps have entered a region of suspension over this earth wafting near each other long duration
3318,3240-131232-0023.flac,and that in his opinion they had been upon the ground in the first place but that there had been some unusual condition aloft comes out in his observation upon the curious azure blue appearance of the sun at the time
3319,3240-131232-0034.flac,again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hybernading snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes
3320,3240-131232-0037.flac,suggests to me something of a migratory nature but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january if ever as to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough
3321,3240-131232-0011.flac,though it harmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary source and of course with other data too is inadequate to account for two peculiarities of the fall of frogs that never has a fall of tadpoles been reported
3322,3240-131232-0005.flac,quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from a magnet theoretically the attraction of a magnet should decrease with the square of the distance but the falling off is found to be almost abrupt at a short distance
3323,3240-131232-0025.flac,there's no mention of whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place nor of a whirlwind lizards
3324,3240-131232-0033.flac,stones fence rails limbs of trees say that the snakes occupied the next gradation and would be the next to fall
3325,3240-131232-0010.flac,but newtonian gravitation admits attraction only then newtonian gravitation can be only one third acceptable even to the orthodox or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of forces or still simpler here are the data
3326,3240-131232-0004.flac,long duration other indications of long duration i think of a region somewhere above this earth's surface in which gravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the distance
3327,3240-131232-0014.flac,before we take up an especial expression upon the fall of immature and larval forms of life to this earth and the necessity then of conceiving of some factor besides mere stationariness or suspension or stagnation
3328,3240-131232-0009.flac,orthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces gravitation is one of these forces all other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness irrespective of distance as well as of attraction
3329,3240-131232-0021.flac,in the first place he found that the snails had appeared after the rain that astonished rusticks had jumped to the conclusion that they had fallen he met one person who said that he had seen the snails fall this was his error says the investigator
3330,3240-131232-0029.flac,rather strictly localized or in a space of two blocks and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found they were crawling on sidewalks in yards and in streets and in masses
3331,3240-131232-0003.flac,final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance with hail or that hailstones too when large are phenomena of suspension of long duration that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could become so great only in falling from the clouds
3332,3240-131232-0020.flac,but has always sought positively to prove or to disprove something that was conceived of or suspected in advance as i suspected says this correspondent i found that the snails were of a familiar land species that they had been upon the ground
3333,3240-131232-0031.flac,in the streets of memphis january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven why that's sensible that's the common sense that has been against us from the first it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not
3334,3240-131232-0027.flac,these data have any meaning or lack of meaning or degree of damnation you please but in the matter of the fall that occurred at memphis tennessee occur some strong significances

3336,3240-131232-0030.flac,but none were found on roofs or any other elevation above ground and none were seen to fall if you prefer to believe that the snakes had always been there or had been upon the ground in the first place and that it was only that something occurred to call special attention to them
3337,3240-131232-0015.flac,there are other data that are similar to data of falls of fishes science gossip
3338,3240-131232-0008.flac,but the omnipresence of heterogeneity or living fishes also ponds of fresh water oceans of salt water as to the law of gravitation i prefer to take one simple stand
3339,3240-131232-0017.flac,none seen to fall by the writer of this account snails said to be quite different to any previously known in this district
3340,3240-131232-0036.flac,records the fall and says that there were thousands of them the usual whirlwind explanation is given but in what locality snakes exists in such abundance is yet a mystery this matter of enormousness of numbers

3342,3240-131232-0000.flac,then i think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of mississippi weeks or months before may eleventh eighteen ninety four no i don't look for it and inevitably find it or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up indefinitely
3343,3240-131232-0013.flac,little or big if such falls be attributed to whirlwinds and more likely to fall from the super sargasso sea if though very tentatively and provisionally we accept the super sargasso sea
3344,3240-131232-0032.flac,and had not been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses in the first place if we try to accept that these snakes had been raised from some other part of this earth's surface in a whirlwind if we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them

3346,3240-131232-0012.flac,that never has a fall of full grown frogs been reported always frogs a few months old it sounds positive but if there be such reports they are somewhere out of my range of reeding but tad poles would be more likely to fall from the sky than would frogs
3347,3240-131232-0026.flac,that during a heavy shower july third eighteen sixty he heard a peculiar sound at his feet and looking down saw a snake lying as if stunned by a fall it then came to life grey snake about a foot long

3362,3240-131231-0020.flac,and something that strikes my attention here is that these frogs are described as almost white i'm afraid there is no escape for us we shall have to give to civilization upon this earth some new worlds places with white frogs in them
3363,3240-131231-0050.flac,something else apart from our three main interests is a phenomena that looks like what one might call an alternating series of falls of fishes whatever the significance may be

3482,8098-278278-0010.flac,then she was rolled on the barrel to get all the water out of her and put to bed with hot flat irons at her feet to prevent croop and mumps then the wake broke up i don't believe the child understood a word that the priest said
3483,8098-278278-0039.flac,so he started on a trot downstream to the bend and then quickly turned falling all over himself and ran toward the cabins faster than i ever saw him run before or since

3520,8098-278252-0032.flac,and only this morning ate two chickens and a duck and chased a farmer into his hayloft but he doesn't bite my statement had a sensational effect on the assembly who one by one sneaked out of the door
3521,8098-278252-0028.flac,i found the store full of loungers who patronized the chairs soap and starch boxes mackerel kits and counter forming a silent circle round a towering stove in the centre
3522,8098-278252-0026.flac,a store loomed into view shortly i was elated according to the sign over the entrance the younger generation was the ruling power it read hezechiah brimley and father

3524,8098-275181-0016.flac,and you was prowling round the fields go off now out there by that stump full of wonder and curiosity i retired to the stump tom meanwhile turned out the mass of nests
3525,8098-275181-0009.flac,no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact it was clear that something must be done and at once too
3526,8098-275181-0030.flac,these numerous bites however were followed by no serious ill effects the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass that he had caught hold of one of its hind legs
3527,8098-275181-0013.flac,each a wad of fine dry grass as large as a quart box these were gathered up and filled the great basket there said he triumphantly don't them smell mousy they did certainly
3528,8098-275181-0019.flac,as i had heard it said that foxes did when mousing instantly two spry brown hands from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip as a fox i struggled tremendously
3529,8098-275181-0003.flac,and by day they wandered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beech nuts which were very plentiful that fall all went well till the last week in october when on taking the senses one morning a turkey was found to be missing
3530,8098-275181-0020.flac,then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone d'ye see now he demanded i saw but a fox would bite you i objected let him bite said tom
3531,8098-275181-0021.flac,with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stone heaps were and where we had oftenest heard foxes bark selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump
3532,8098-275181-0017.flac,and with it completely covered himself the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest or rather a small haycock
3533,8098-275181-0014.flac,they savored as strongly of mice as tom's question of bad grammar and don't foxes catch mice demanded tom confidently yes but i don't see how that's going to catch a fox i said
3534,8098-275181-0018.flac,inside the nest evidently there were mice in it and feeling my character as fox at stake i at once trotted forward then crept up and as the rustling and squeaking continued made a pounce into the grass
3535,8098-275181-0001.flac,to call the real mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps this indeed is a favorite trick of reynard at the time of my story my friend tom edwards ten years of age
3536,8098-275181-0010.flac,or ruin would swallow up the poultry firm rightly or wrongly we attributed the mischief to a certain silver gray that had several times been seen in the neighborhood that autumn
3537,8098-275181-0011.flac,it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks i recollect that we set three traps for him to no purpose
3538,8098-275181-0023.flac,made by sucking the air sharply between his teeth now be off said tom and don't come poking around nor get in sight till you hear me holler
3539,8098-275181-0015.flac,well look here then i'll show ye said he
3540,8098-275181-0005.flac,tom thought it was the twombly boys nefarious sam in particular i thought it might have been an owl but under the tree in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug we found fox tracks
3541,8098-275181-0008.flac,this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only twenty nine the next morning there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter
3542,8098-275181-0006.flac,and two or three ominous little wads of feathers with one long tail feather adrift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butter nut had a fit perhaps
3543,8098-275181-0000.flac,their sharp cur like barks used often to rouse us and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields mousing around the stone heaps making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse
3544,8098-275181-0004.flac,the thirty one had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening it was the first one we had lost we proceeded to look for traces our suspicions were divided
3545,8098-275181-0007.flac,and a casualty such as turkey razers are unavoidably airs to and we bore our loss with resignation we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roosts
3546,8098-275181-0024.flac,and being amidst nice cosy straw i presently went to sleep quite unintentionally i must have slept some time though it seemed to me but a very few minutes what woke me was a noise a sharp suppressed yelp
3547,8098-275181-0032.flac,i do not think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again however we sold the fox skin in the village and received thirteen dollars for it whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than three dollars
3548,8098-275181-0027.flac,he said not a word but left me to poke about and stumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near bike ye i exclaimed after satisfying myself that the fox was dead some said tom
3549,8098-275181-0012.flac,had succeeded in getting two more of the turkeys heroes it is said are born of great crises this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius i'll have that fox he said when the traps failed
3550,8098-275181-0028.flac,and that was all i could get from him that night we took the fox to the house and lighted a candle it was the silver gray tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed
3551,8098-275181-0025.flac,it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field
3552,8098-275181-0022.flac,tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contents of the big basket he then practised squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim his squeaks were perfect successes
3553,8098-275181-0031.flac,i just determined to have it out with him considering the fact that a fox is a very active sharp biting animal and that this was an unusually large male i have always thought tom got off very well
3554,8098-275181-0033.flac,how or by what wiles that fox got the turkeys out of the high butter nut is a secret
3555,8098-275181-0002.flac,and myself were in the turkey business equal partners we owned a flock of thirty one turkeys these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house in the very top of it
3556,8098-275181-0029.flac,his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow several miner nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab
